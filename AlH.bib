Abstract = {{The composition of the most primitive solar system condensates, suc
h as
   calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and micron-sized corundum
   grains, show that short-lived radionuclides (SLR), e.g., 26Al, were
   present in the early solar system. Their abundances require a local or
   stellar origin, which, however, is far from being understood. We present
   for the first time the abundances of several SLR up to 60Fe predicted
   from stars with initial mass in the range approximately 711 M circle
   dot. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning. After core C
burning they go through a Super-asymptotic giant branch (Super-AGB)
   phase, with the H and He shells activated alternately, episodic thermal
   pulses in the He shell, a very hot temperature at the base of the
   convective envelope (approximately 108 K), and strong stellar winds
   driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding interstellar medium.
   The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB stars are mostly ONe
   white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce 26Al/27Al yield ratios
   approximately 0.020.26. These models can account for the canonical value
   of the 26Al/27Al ratio using dilutions with the solar nebula of the
   order of 1 part of Super-AGB mass per several 102 to several 103 of
   solar nebula mass, resulting in associated changes in the O-isotope
   composition in the range Delta 17O from 3 to 20 parts per thousand. This
   is in agreement with observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive
   solar system condensates, which do not carry the signature of a stellar
   polluter. The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron
   captures in Super-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also
   matched by some of our models, depending on the nuclear and stellar
   physics uncertainties as well as the meteoritic experimental data. We
   also expect and are currently investigating Super-AGB production of SLR
   heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.}},

Title = {{An observational study of dust nucleation in Mira (o Ceti) I. Variable
   features of AlO and other Al- bearing species}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{592}},
Abstract = {{Context. Dust is efficiently produced by cool giant stars, but the
   condensation of inorganic dust is poorly understood. Observations of key
   aluminum bearing molecules around evolved stars has enabled us to
   investigate the nucleation of alumina (Al2O3)dust in the gas.
   Aims. We aim to identify and characterize aluminum bearing species in
   the circumstellar gas of Mira (o Ceti) in order to elucidate their role
   in the production of Al2O3 dust.
   Methods. We used multiepoch spectral line observations at (sub-)
   millimeter, far-infrared, and optical wavelengths including: maps with
   ALMA that probe the gas distribution in the immediate vicinity of the
   star at similar to 30 mas; observations with ALMA, APEX, and Herschel in
   2013 2015 for studying cycle and inter-cycle variability of the
   rotational lines of Al-bearing molecules; optical records as far back as
   1965 to examine variations in electronic transitions over time spans of
   days to decades; and velocity measurements and excitation analysis of
   the spectral features that constrain the physical parameters of the gas.
   Results. Three diatomic molecules AlO, AlOH, and AlH, and atomic Al i
   are the main observable aluminum species in Mira, although a significant
   fraction of aluminum might reside in other species that have not yet
   been identified. Strong irregular variability in the (sub-) millimeter
   and optical features of AlO (possibly the direct precursor of Al2O3)
   indicates substantial changes in the excitation conditions, or varying
   abundance that is likely related to shocks in the star. The
   inhomogeneous distribution of AlO might influence the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of dust production.
   Conclusions. We are unable to quantitatively trace aluminum depletion
   from the gas, but the rich observational material constrains
   time-dependent chemical networks. Future improvements should include
   spectroscopic characterization of higher aluminum oxides, coordinated
   observations of dust and gas species at different variability phases,
   and tools to derive abundances in shock-excited gas.}},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {130},
Abstract = {Vibrational zero-point energies (ZPEs) determined from ab initio
   calculations are often scaled by empirical factors. An empirical scaling
   factor partially compensates for the effects arising from vibrational
   anharmonicity and incomplete treatment of electron correlation. These
   effects are not random but are systematic. We report scaling factors for
   32 combinations of theory and basis set, intended for predicting ZPEs
   from computed harmonic frequencies. An empirical scaling factor carries
   uncertainty. We quantify and report, for the first time, the
   uncertainties associated with scaling factors for ZPE. The uncertainties
   are larger than generally acknowledged; the scaling factors have only
   two significant digits. For example, the scaling factor for
   B3LYP/6-31G(d) is 0.9757 +/- 0.0224 (standard uncertainty). The
   uncertainties in the scaling factors lead to corresponding uncertainties
   in predicted ZPEs. The proposed method for quantifying the uncertainties
   associated with scaling factors is based upon the Guide to the
   Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, published by the International
   Organization for Standardization. We also present a new reference set of

   splittings, which are critical for the astronomical identification of
   these molecules, were measured for both AlH and AlD. In the case of AlH,
   the observed hyperfine pattern was not consistent with previous
   measurements. Values of the hyperfine parameters have thus been revised

Abstract = {{The nuclear quadrupole coupling and spin-rotation constants of aluminum
   in AlH and AID have been determined using coupled cluster theory with
   single and double excitations as well as perturbative inclusion of
   triples {[}CCSD(T)] combined with large correlation-consistent basis
   sets, cc-pCVXZ (X = T, Q and 5) and aug-cc-pCVXZ (X = T, Q). The
   anharmonic vibrational frequencies have been computed using second-order
   vibrational perturbation theory and the effects of vibrational averaging
   on the hyperfine constants have been determined. The ground state dipole
   moment has been determined for both isotopologues (AlH and AID) and
   shown to depend critically on vibrational averaging. For completeness,
   the isotropic and anisotropic nuclear magnetic shielding tensors are
   also reported. All the results agree well with the best available
   experimental measurements, and in some cases (spin-rotation constants
   and dipole moments) refine the known data. The present computational
   results for the vibrationally averaged electric field gradients suggest
   that the currently accepted nuclear quadruple moment for Al-27 of 146.6
   +/- 1.0 mb may be slightly underestimated. Based on the experimental
   measurements of the nuclear quadrupole coupling for AlH (AID) and best
   computational determinations of the vibrationally averaged electric
   field gradients, the quadruple moment of Al-27 is determined to be 149
   +/- 2 mb (148 +/- 3 mb). However, this conclusion would be further
   strengthened with more precise experimental measurement of the Al-27

   Emission in the A-X (0,0) and (1,1) bands, from the upsilon'=0 and 1

   forbidden transition, b 3-SIGMA--X 1-SIGMA+, in AlH. Spectroscopic
   constants determined from an analysis of bands assigned to upsilon = 0
   and upsilon = 1 of the b 3-SIGMA- state are T(e) = 40 524 cm-1, B(e) =
   7.0675 cm-1, D(e) = 6.1 x 10(-5) cm-1, alpha(e) = 0.637 cm-1, beta(e) =
   6.38 x 10(-4), and gamma(e) = 1.5725, with upsilon = 0 spin-orbit and
   spin-rotation coupling parameters lambda-0 = 0.29 cm-1, and gamma-0 =
   0.03 cm-1, inducing structure in a transition that appears to be
   predominantly parallel. For upsilon = 1, spin-orbit coupling is much
   stronger, and rotational branch intensities suggest interference,
   indicating that both parallel and perpendicular components of the
   transition moment contribute to the total oscillator strength. Results
   for the C-X (0-0) transitions give B0 = 6.3869 cm-1 and D0 = 5.329 x
   10(-4) with T0 = 44 594.05 cm-1 for the AlH C state, and B0 = 3.3457
   cm-1 and D0 = 1.380 X 10(-4) cm-1 with T0 = 44 631.09 cm-1 for the AlD C

Year = {1991},

Pages = {795-799},
Abstract = {The electronic structure and electronic states of AlPh (P = porphin
   dianion) have been investigated by means of SCF, two-configurations SCF
   (TC-SCF) and contracted Cl calculations.  The binding energy
   corresponding to the dissociation of the Al-H bond is 82 and 92 kcal/mol
   at the TC-SCF and Cl levels, appreciably larger than the values of 55
   and 59 kcal/mol obtained at the same levels of theory for the diatomic
   hydride AlH (a consequence of the different nature of the bonding with a
   sigma-bond involving a 3s orbital of Al in AlPH and a 3p-sigma orbital
   in AlH).  The two 3E-pi --> pi{*} states were calculated at 20400 and
   21200 cm-1 and the corresponding 1E states at 24600 and 44100 cm-1.  The
   1E and 3E sigma --> pi{*} states (sigma being the m.o. which is bonding
   between Al and H) were located at 33200 and 35400 cm-1.  The potential
   energy curves corresponding to the dissociation of the Al-H bond in AlPH
   were calculated at the MR-ClSD level with six electrons correlated.  A
   qualitative mechanism has been proposed for the photolysis of the Al-X
   bond in AlPX (X = H or CH3) on the basis of these potential energy
   curves.  A rationale has also been given for the accelerating effect of
   visible light in the reactions of aluminium alkyl- and arylporphyrins
   with nucleophiles.},

Title = {{The effective temperature scale of M dwarfs}},

Abstract = {{Context. Despite their large number in the Galaxy, M dwarfs remain
   elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long remained
   a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation).
   Aims. Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres,
   update the M dwarf T-eff-spectral type relation, and find the
   atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample.
   Methods. We compare two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M
   dwarf sequence with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a
   chi(2) minimization technique to determine T-eff. The first sample
   consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology
   Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55
   medium-resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory
   (SSO). The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already
   classified M dwarfs.
   Results. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope
   of the spectral energy distribution and most of its features. Only the
   CaOH band at 5570 angstrom and AlH and NaH hydrides in the blue part of
   the spectra are still missing in the models. The T-eff scale obtained
   with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m spectra is consistent with that
   obtained with the NTT spectra. We compare our T-eff scale with those of
   other authors and with published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors.
   We also present relations between effective temperature, spectral type,
   and colors of the M dwarfs.}},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {167-177},
Abstract = {{The b(3)Sigma(-)-a(3)Pi visible system of AlH was observed at high
   resolution by using a high accuracy, dispersive optical spectroscopy
   technique. The emission spectrum was excited in an aluminum
   hollow-cathode lamp with two anodes, filled with a static Ne/NH3 gas
   mixture. In the 25, 900-26, 500 cm(-1) spectral region, the rotational
   structure of the two overlapped 0-0 and 1-1 bands was clearly observed
   and precisely measured. In total, 260 transition wavenumbers have been
   assigned with an estimated accuracy of about 0.005 cm(-1). The open
   rotational structure of the Q branches in both bands has been measured
   for the first time, and the A-doubling in the a(3)Pi,v = 0,1 levels has
   been described by o,p and q parameters. For example, the values for the
   v = 0 level are P-0 = 1.754(14) x 10(-2) cm(-1), q(0) = 3.264(28) x
   10(-3) cm(-1) and o(0) = 9.34(20) x 10(-2) cm(-1). Moreover, the
   spin-orbit interaction constants for the a(3)Pi state have been obtained
   experimentally as follows: A(0) = 40.6040(42) cm(-1) and A(1) =
   40.419(59) cm(-1). The a(3)Pi, v = 0,1 levels are considered as regular,
   while for the b(3)Sigma(-), v = 0,1 levels considerable perturbations in
   the rotational structure have been observed. Consequently, these states
   have been represented in a different way in our least-squares treatment:
   a(3)Pi state by molecular constants and b(3)Sigma(-) state by term
   values. The observed irregularities in the b(3)Sigma(-) state have been
   graphically described by plotting experimental minus calculated term
   values versus quantum number N for the v = 0 level, as well as by
   plotting reduced term values versus N(N + 1) for the v = 1 level.}},

abstract = "Abstract The emission spectrum of the AlD isotopologue has been experimentally studied using Fourier transform spectroscopy in the 17 , 700 − 28 , 500 cm−1 spectral region. AlD molecules were produced within an aluminum hollow-cathode lamp with two anodes in the presence of 2.7 Torr of Ne and 0.2 Torr of ND3. The observed bands have been assigned to the A 1 Π − X 1 Σ + ( 0 − 0 , 1 and 1 − 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 bands) and C 1 Σ + − A 1 Π ( 0 − 0 and 1 − 1 bands) transitions. In total, more than 450 rotational frequencies were measured with an absolute accuracy of about 0.002 cm−1. The current data have been combined with available measurements of the pure rotational lines by Halfen and Ziurys [Astrophys J 2010; 713: 520-523] and with the ro-vibrational bands by White et al. [J Chem Phys 1993;99:8371-8378] to provide improved spectroscopic constants of the X 1 Σ + , A 1 Π and C 1 Σ + states of AlD. These results match closely theoretical values obtained using a new set of ab initio potentials calculated with a spin-orbit Hamiltonian. "

Experimenting on AlH+ ions held in a radiofrequency trap, we confirm dissociation via this channel with analysis performed using time-of-flight mass spectrometry, demonstrate the use of \{REMPD\} for rotational state analysis, and measure the rotational distribution of trapped AlH+ to be consistent with the expected thermal distribution. AlH+ is a particularly interesting species because its electronic level structure is compatible with proposals to perform rotational optical pumping, direct Doppler cooling, and single-molecule fluorescence detection. Potential applications of trapped AlH+ include searches for time-varying constants, quantum information processing, and ultracold chemistry studies. "
