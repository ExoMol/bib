   previous dispersed fluorescence studies. The expected bright state,
   nu(2) + 4 nu(4) is observed to be coupled to the nearly degenerate 7
   nu(4), state by a Coriolis mechanism. A least-squares analysis yields
   values for zero-order vibrational energies, rotational constants, and a
   Coriolis-coupling coefficient that are all consistent with expectations.
   Calculated relative intensities of SEP transitions, accounting for
   interference due to axis-switching effects, are also consistent with
   observations. Implications of the observed Coriolis resonance with
   regard to global acetylene vibrational dynamics are also discussed.},

Pages = {681-698},
Abstract = {The variational method has been used to determine the geometry and
ground state potential surface of acetylene. All the parameters were
refined through a least-squares fit to J = 0, 1 levels for C2H2 and
C2D2. A new program was written to evaluate the rovibrational energy
levels; in particular, primitive basis sets were developed for all
values of J taking into account the singularity for linear geometries.
Thus Sigma, Pi, Delta states can be refined. The full theory for
tetraatomic linear molecules is presented. In this refinement 150
observed levels were used as data, below 10 000 cm(1). The geometry was
refined and gives R-e(CC) = 1.2028 Angstrom, R-e(CH) = 1.0618 Angstrom,
to be compared with the best experimentally derived values of 1.2027 +/-
0.0005 Angstrom, 1.062 +/- 0.001 Angstrom, respectively. The zero point
energies are 5771.1 cm(1) for C2H2 and 4571.1 cm(1) for C2D2.},

   The derived spectroscopic parameters reproduce the transition
   wavenumbers with a RMS value of the order of the experimental
   uncertainty. Using the same model larger discrepancies between observed
   and calculated values have been obtained for transitions involving

and 7.5-mum spectral regions (improved line intensities), and the 5-mum
region (previously absent from the database). These changes are
reviewed, and the key problem of the validation of line intensities is
dealt with. The status of the currently available line parameters is
critically examined, and recommendations for future improvements are given.},

Abstract = {We investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich asymptotic giant
   branch (AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the
   Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
   over the 5-38 $\mu$m range. All 26 low-resolution spectra show acetylene
   (C2H2) bands at 7 and 14 $\mu$m. The hydrogen cyanide (HCN) bands at these
   wavelengths are very weak or absent. This is consistent with low
   nitrogen abundances in the LMC. The observed 14 $\mu$m C2H2 band is
   reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 K. There is no
   clear dilution of the 14 $\mu$m C2H2 band by circumstellar dust emission.
   This 14-$\mu$m band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar
   envelope in these high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous
   findings for Galactic stars. The C2H2 column density, derived from the
   13.7 $\mu$m band, shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3 x 10(-6) to 5
   x 10(-5) M-circle dot yr(-1). This is comparable with the total
   mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from the spectral energy
   distribution. Additionally, we compare the line strengths of the 13.7 mu
   m C2H2 band of our LMC sample with those of a Galactic sample. Despite
   the low metallicity of the LMC, there is no clear difference in the C2H2
   abundance among LMC and Galactic stars. This reflects the effect of the
   third dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to
   high carbon-to-oxygen ratio at low metallicity.},

Abstract = {Using FT spectra (Bruker IFS 120, unapodized resolution approximate to
   0.01 cm$^{-1}$) of acetylene $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$, line positions and intensities,
   as well as self-broadening and -shifting coefficients are measured for
   about 550 lines of 13 bands between 5000 and 6000 cm-1. A multispectrum
   fitting procedure is used to retrieve line parameters from four
   experimental spectra recorded at different pressures. An absolute
   wavenumber calibration has been performed using isolated acetylene line
   positions around 5900 cm$^{-1}$. The average accuracy of the line
   parameters obtained in this work is estimated to be +/- 0.001 cm$^{-1}$ for
   line positions, 5-10\% for line intensities depending on the
   transitions, about 5\% for self-broadening coefficients, and +/- 0.005
   cm$^{-1}$ atm(-1) for self-shifting coefficients. For each studied band,
   the vibrational transition dipole moment squared and the empirical
   Herman-Wallis coefficients are adjusted. The measured line intensities
   allow to obtain the effective dipole moment parameters of the global
   approach for the Delta P = 8 and 9 series. A polynomial description of
   the rotational dependence of self-broadening coefficients is performed.
   A weak rotational dependence of the self-shifting coefficients is
   observed.},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {Acetylene occurs, by photolysis of methane, in the atmospheres of jovian
planets and Titan. In contrast, acetylene is only a trace component of
Earth's current atmosphere. Nonetheless, a methane-rich atmosphere has
been hypothesized for early Earth; this atmosphere would also have been
rich in acetylene. This poses a paradox, because acetylene is a potent
inhibitor of many key anaerobic microbial processes, including
methanogenesis, anaerobic methane oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and
hydrogen oxidation. Fermentation of acetylene was discovered similar to
25 years ago, and Pelobacter acetylenicus was shown to grow on acetylene
by virtue of acetylene hydratase, which results in the formation of
acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde subsequently dismutates to ethanol and
acetate ( plus some hydrogen). However, acetylene hydratase is specific
for acetylene and does not react with any analogous compounds. We
hypothesize that microbes with acetylene hydratase played a key role in
the evolution of Earth's early biosphere by exploiting an available
source of carbon from the atmosphere and in so doing formed protective
niches that allowed for other microbial processes to flourish.
Furthermore, the presence of acetylene in the atmosphere of a planet or
planetoid could possibly represent evidence for an extraterrestrial
anaerobic ecosystem.},

   coupling in the global model and analysis of emission spectra of hot
   acetylene around 3 $\mu$m. J Chem Phys 2009;131:114301]. The present
   investigation focuses on the relative emission line intensities which
   are observed to be affected. The strongest lines intensity may be
   considerably reduced for high column density acetylene samples, hence
   affecting the 3:1 ortho:para intensity ratio. A radiative model is
   developed to take into account the effects generated by the strong
   opacity of the acetylene samples including self-absorption and
   absorption of the radiation emitted by the hot environment. The model is
   used to extract the absolute concentration of the high temperature
   acetylene samples from the observed relative spectral intensities. The
   relevance of the procedure for infrared remote sensing in high
   temperature astrophysical environments, such as circumstellar envelopes
   of cool carbon rich evolved stars, is discussed.}}

abstract = {We present full-dimensional quantum mechanical calculations of the vibrational states of acetylene. The calculation scheme is a combination of several methods. The molecular Hamiltonian is represented in CH–CH diatom–diatom Jacobi coordinates. Phase space optimized discrete variable representation is used to construct effective one-dimensional basis functions for radial coordinates, and a basis contraction strategy is applied to angular coordinates. Parity and diatom–diatom permutation symmetry are exploited. The final Hamiltonian matrix is sparse, and an iterative technique combined with an efficient preconditioner is employed to calculate the eigenvalues within desired spectral windows. It is shown that our computation is efficient and accurate, and nearly ideal scaling with respect to increasing energy is achieved. }

Abstract = {The P(11) line of the nu(1) + nu(3) combination band of C2H2 was studied

   shapes were measured for acetylene and nitrogen gas mixtures at a series
   of temperatures between 125 and 296 K and total pressures up to 1 atm.
   The data were fit to two speed-dependent line shape models and the
   results were compared. Line shape parameters were determined by
   simultaneously fitting data for all temperatures and pressures in a
   single multispectrum analysis. Earlier pure acetylene measurements
   {[}Cich et al. Appl. Phys. B 2012, 109, 373-38] were incorporated to
   account for self-perturbation. The resulting parameters reproduce the
   observed line shapes for the acetylene-nitrogen system over the range of
   temperatures and pressures studied with average root-mean-square
   observed-calculated errors of individual line measurement fits of
   approximately 0.01\% of maximum transmission, close to the experimental

   the major systematic errors in these measurements, and a statistical

   center frequencies with absolute accuracy of 0.2 MHz, or less than one
   thousandth of the room temperature Doppler width.. This accuracy is
   verified through comparison with previous saturated absorption

   spectrum, the center frequencies of 46 well-isolated strong lines are
   determined with similar high accuracy, along with the center frequencies
   for 1107 non-isolated lines at lower accuracy. The measured methane
   line-center frequencies have an uncertainty comparable to the few

Abstract = {We have carried out an investigation of the chemical evolution of gas in
   different carbon-rich circumstellar environments. Previous studies have
   tended to invoke terrestrial flame chemistries, based on acetylene
   (C2H2) combustion to model the formation of carbon dust, via polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this work, we pay careful attention to
   the accurate calculation of the molecular photoreaction rate
   coefficients to ascertain whether there is a universal formation
   mechanism for carbon dust in strongly irradiated astrophysical
   environments. A large number of possible chemical channels may exist for
   the formation of PAHs, so we have concentrated on the viability of the
   formation of the smallest building block species, C2H2, in a variety of
   carbon-rich stellar outflows. C2H2 is very sensitive to dissociation by
   UV radiation. This sensitivity is tested, using models of the
   time-dependent chemistry. We find that C2H2 formation is sensitive to
   some of the physical parameters and that in some known sources of dust
   formation it can never attain appreciable abundances. Therefore,
   multiple (and currently ill-defined) dust-formation channels must exist.},

To validate the Tomsk calculations new measurements of both line positions and intensities were performed using acetylene spectra recorded between 25 and 680 cm�1 with the AILES-A beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron. Line positions and intensities of 627 transitions belonging to 9 bands have been measured for the first time in this region. Using the results of these new measurements and the published results of the measurements in the 13 � 248 cm�1 and 390 � 634 cm�1 regions performed with the same facilities new fittings of the line intensities for the �P = 0 and �P = 1 series of transitions have been performed. Here P = 5v1 + 3v2 + 5v3 + v4 + v5 is a polyad number, where v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5 are the principal quantum numbers of the acetylene harmonic oscillators. These new sets of the effective dipole moment parameters were used to generate the line list which contains the line positions and intensities of 39 and 29 bands, respectively for the �P = 0 and �P = 1 series of transitions. None of these bands is present in the HITRAN 2012 and GEISA 2015 databases. This paper presents the first part of a global work on the validation of Tomsk calculations.}

On the basis of these works, in the present contribution, we construct an empirical database for acetylene in the 5850 � 9415 cm�1 region excluding the 6341�7000 cm�1 interval corresponding to the very strong �1+�3 manifold. Our database gathers and extends information included in our CRDS and FTS studies. In particular, the intensities of about 1700 lines measured by CRDS in the 7244�7920 cm�1 are reported for the first time together with those of several bands of 12C13CH2 present in natural isotopic abundance in the acetylene sample. The Herman-Wallis coefficients of most of the bands are derived from a fit of the measured intensity values. A recommended line list is provided with positions calculated using empirical spectroscopic parameters of the lower and upper energy vibrational levels and intensities calculated using the derived Herman-Wallis coefficients. This approach allows completing the experimental list by adding missing lines and improving poorly determined positions and intensities. As a result the constructed line list includes a total of 10973 lines belonging to 146 bands of $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ and 29 bands of 12C13CH2. For comparison the HITRAN database in the same region includes 869 lines of 14 bands, all belonging to $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$. Our weakest lines have an intensity on the order of 10�29 cm/molecule, about three orders of magnitude smaller than the HITRAN intensity cut off. Line profile parameters are added to the line list which is provided in HITRAN format. The comparison of our acetylene database to the HITRAN line list or to results obtained using the global effective operator approach is discussed in terms of completeness and accuracy. }

Such dipole moment changes and transition moments consist of two components, one depending on the first dipole moment derivatives with respect to bond lengths and the other depending on the second dipole moment derivatives with respect to bond angles. We show that the first component normally contributes little, and propose an approximation in which only the second component is retained. This approximation is practically important because the second component can be calculated without the anharmonic force constants. We derive formulas for the dipole moment changes and transition moments to facilitate a simultaneous analysis of different isotopic species. We introduce the concept of the equivalent mode, by which we may readily understand the correlation between the dipole moment change for a bending mode and the transition moment for a vibrational band. }

Mol. Spectrosc. 116, 320–333 (1986)]. In the case of acetylene it has been verified that such vibrational changes and transition moments are well approximated by the terms which may be calculated without the anharmonic force field. The second derivative of the dipole moment component parallel to the CC bond with respect to the CCH angle is determined as (∂2μ‖∂α12)e = −2.123 ± 0.035 D for HCCH. The corresponding derivative in HCCCCH is shown to be about 40\% larger than in HCCH. This fact may be ascribed to the conjugation of the two CC triple bonds. The concept of the equivalent mode helps us graphically understand the correlation between certain transition moments and vibrational changes of the dipole moment.}

abstract = {Absorption spectra of C2H2 have been recorded between 50 and 1450 cm−1, with a resolution always better than 0.005 cm−1, using two different Fourier transform spectrometers. Analysis of the data provided two sets of results. First, the bending levels with Σt Vt(t = 4, 5) ≤ 2 were characterized by a coherent set of 34 parameters derived from the simultaneous analysis of 15 bands, performed using a matrix Hamiltonian. The following main parameters were obtained (in cm−1): ω40 = 608.985196(14), ω50 = 729.157564(10); B0 = 1.17664632(18), α4 = −1.353535(86) × 10−3, α5 = −2.232075(40) × 10−3; q40 = 5.24858(12) × 10−3, and q50 = 4.66044(12) × 10−3, with the errors (1σ) on the last quoted digit. Second, a more complete set of bending levels with Σt Vt ≤ 4, some of which have never previously been reported, and also including V2 = 1 have been fitted to 80 parameters. This simultaneous fit involved 43 bands and used the same full Hamiltonian matrix. Some perturbations which affect the higher excited levels are discussed.},

Abstract = {We achieve a systematic modeling of all rovibrational levels in the
   $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ ((X) over tilde (1) Sigma(g)(+)) molecule, which is tested
   up to the near infrared range. It is based on the cluster picture, which
   was demonstrated to block diagonalize the full vibrational energy
   matrix, and to allow unraveling the vibrational energy pattern in
   $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$, up to 12 000 cm$^{-1}$ {[}see M. Abbouti Temsamani and M.
   Herman, J. Chem. Phys. 102, 6371 (1995)]. Each of those clusters, which
   are called here V-clusters, is made of pure vibrational type diagonal
   and off-diagonal matrix elements. That model is extended to take care of
   the rotational structure, defining the V/l/C-cluster model. In a first
   step J-dependent terms are included in the diagonal elements of the
   V-clusters, and rotational l resonance off-diagonal matrix elements are
   included, leading to couple specific V-cluster matrices, resulting into
   so-called V/l-clusters. This extension is quantitatively demonstrated to
   reproduce the reported effective principal rotational constant and
   effective higher order distortion constants, for four selected clusters
   of levels: those containing V-1 + V-3, V-1 + V-2 + V-3. 3V(3) and V-2 +
   3V(3). In the case of the 3v(3) range, new FTIR spectra recorded around
   9700 cm$^{-1}$ are used. The related experimental conditions and new
   observed spectral features are briefly presented. A further extension of
   the model is then accomplished to include Coriolis-type interaction, by
   coupling V/l-clusters using a systematic mechanism. That step, defining

Abstract = {A generalization of a previously reported technique for investigating
   vibrationally excited states via high resolution Raman spectroscopy is
   proposed. In a first step, a vibrational state, typically not accessible
   by a dipole moment transition from the ground state, is populated in a
   pulsed stimulated Raman process. After a delay of several nanoseconds, a
   high resolution spectrum corresponding to transitions from this long
   Lived state is recorded following a quasi-cw stimulated Raman
   spectroscopy scheme. The use of a pulsed dye laser for providing one of
   the pumping radiations overcomes some of the limitations of the
   previously proposed scheme, where this radiation was generated by a
   Raman shifter filled at relatively high pressure with the gas under
   study. Experimental aspects are discussed and the spectra of the Q
   branches of 2 nu(2)(Sigma(g)(+))-nu(2)(Sigma(g)(+)) of $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ and
   (C2H2)-C-13 are presented. The analysis of the measured transitions
   yielded accurate values of the spectroscopic parameters for the
   upsilon(2)=2 vibrationally excited state for both isotopomers and
   improved values of the corresponding anharmonicity constants x(22)(0)
   are derived.},

abstract = {A symmetry-adapted filter-diagonalization method is used to calculate the vibrational spectrum of planar acetylene. In this method, vibrational eigenvalues in a given symmetry are obtained by solving a generalized eigenproblem in which the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices are assembled from symmetry-adapted correlation functions. Since no filtered state is explicitly needed, the calculation requires a relatively small memory. The numerical efficiency is further improved as the correlation functions belonging to various symmetry species are generated from a single wave packet. Comparison with existing data for the acetylene system confirms its accuracy and efficiency. }

Title = {{A purely ab initio spectroscopic quality quartic force field for
acetylene}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {676-691},
Abstract = {The quartic force field of acetylene was determined using the CCSD(T)
method (coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions and
quasiperturbative inclusion of connected triple excitations) with a
variety of one-particle basis sets of the atomic natural orbital,
correlation consistent, and augmented correlation consistent types. The
harmonic pi(g) bending frequency omega(4) and the corresponding
anharmonicity omega(4)-nu(4) are both found to be extremely sensitive to
the basis set used, in particular to the presence of a sufficient
complement of diffuse functions, (Due to symmetry cancellation, the
corresponding effect on the pi(u) mode, i.e., omega(5) and
omega(5)-nu(5), is much weaker.) Similar phenomena are observed more
generally in bending modes for molecules that possess carbon-carbon
multiple bonds. Tentative explanations are advanced, Our best computed
quartic force field, which combines CCSD(T)/{[}6s5p4d3f2g/4s3p2d1f]
anharmonicities with a geometry and harmonic frequencies that
additionally include inner-shell correlation effects, reproduces the
observed fundamentals for HCCH, HCCD, DCCD, (HCCH)-C-13, and
(HCCH)-C-13-C-13 with a mean absolute error of 1.3 cm$^{-1}$, and the
equilibrium rotational constant to four decimal places, without any
empirical adjustment. Anharmonicity and quartic resonance constants are
in excellent agreement with the recent determination of Temsamani and
Herman {[}J. Chem. Phys. 103, 6371 (1995)], except for the vibrational
l-doubling constant R-45, for which an adjustment to the computed force
field is proposed. },

   satisfactorily compare with the experimental results. Problems are
   demonstrated to concern a fraction of the 34 remaining levels only.

   shapes in order to extract more precise information concerning the
