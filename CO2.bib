Title = {{CARBON DIOXIDE IN EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES: RARELY DOMINANT COMPARED TO
   CARBON MONOXIDE AND WATER IN HOT, HYDROGEN-DOMINATED ATMOSPHERES}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {817},
Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the abundance of carbon dioxide in
   exoplanetary atmospheres in hot, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We
   construct novel analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium
   that include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, methane and
   acetylene and relate the equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions
   to temperature and pressure via the tabulated Gibbs free energies. We
   prove that such chemical systems may be described by a quintic equation
   for the mixing ratio of methane. By examining the abundances of these
   molecules across a broad range of temperatures (spanning equilibrium
   temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via temperature-pressure
   profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and
   carbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant
   compared to carbon monoxide and water. Atmospheric mixing does not alter
   this conclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the
   atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable
   abundances if the metallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is
   negated by temperatures above 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated
   atmospheres, our generic result has the implication that retrieval
   studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon dioxide as a prior of
   the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam free as a
   fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions. We
   discuss the relevance of these implications for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b
   and suggest that some of the previous results are chemically impossible.
   The relative abundance of carbon dioxide to acetylene is potentially a
   sensitive diagnostic of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio.},

This technology has been used in a variety of low dose, human health related studies over the last 20 years when very high sensitivity was needed. \{AMS\} helped pioneer these scientific methods, but its expensive facilities and requirements for highly trained technical staff have limited their proliferation. Quantification of 14C by cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) offers an approach that eliminates many of the shortcomings of an accelerator-based system and would supplement the use of \{AMS\} in biomedical research. Our initial prototype, using a non-ideal wavelength laser and under suboptimal experimental conditions, has a 3.5-modern, 1- σ precision for detection of milligram-sized, carbon-14-elevated samples. These results demonstrate proof of principle and provided a starting point for the development of a spectrometer capable of biologically relevant sensitivities. "

abstract = "Abstract This study reports the results from analyzing a number of high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra in the 2.06-μm spectral region for pure \{CO2\} and mixtures of \{CO2\} in dry air. A multispectrum nonlinear least squares curve fitting technique has been used to retrieve the various spectral line parameters. The dataset includes 27 spectra: ten pure CO2, two 99\% 13C-enriched \{CO2\} and fifteen spectra of mixtures of 12C-enriched \{CO2\} in dry air. The spectra were recorded at various gas sample temperatures between 170 and 297 K. The absorption path lengths range from 0.347 to 49 m. The sample pressures for the pure \{CO2\} spectra varied from 1.1 to 594 Torr; for the two 13CO2 spectra the pressures were ∼10 and 146 Torr. For the air-broadened spectra, the pressures of the gas mixtures varied between 200 and 711 Torr with \{CO2\} volume mixing ratios ranging from 0.014\% to 0.203\%. The multispectrum fitting technique was applied to fit simultaneously all these spectra to retrieve consistent set of line positions, intensities, and line shape parameters including their temperature dependences; for this, the Voigt line shape was modified to include line mixing (via the relaxation matrix formalism) and quadratic speed dependence. The new results are compared to select published values, including recent ab initio calculations. These results are required to retrieve the column averaged dry air mole fraction (XCO2) from space-based observations, such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite mission that \{NASA\} launched in July 2014.

Abstract={{We present an atmospheric version, CDSD-296, of the carbon dioxide spectroscopic databank (CDSD). The databank contains the calculated line parameters (positions, intensities, air- and self-broadened half-widths, coefficients of temperature dependence of air-broadened half-widths and air pressure-induced line shifts) of the twelve stable isotopic species of CO 2 . The reference temperature is T ref =296K and the intensity cutoff is I cut =10 −30 cm −1 /(moleculecm −2 ). More than 500,000 lines covering the 6–14,075cm −1 spectral range are included in CDSD-296. The databank has been generated within the framework of the method of effective operators and based on the global weighted fits of spectroscopic parameters (parameters of the effective Hamiltonians and effective dipole moment operators) to observed data collected from the literature. The fitted models are able to reproduce known measured positions and intensities with accuracies compatible with measurement uncertainties. The line-shape parameters originate from the recent theoretical and semi-empirical calculations. Comparisons of CDSD-296 with HITRAN-2012, GEISA-2011, and the AMES line lists are also given.}},

   rovibrational levels are computed up to 30,000 cm(-1), and related
   transitions are cut off at 1E-42 cm molecule(-1) (296 K) and 1E-36 cm
   molecule(-1) (1000 K). These are the first line lists available to cover
   reliably the energy region as high as similar to 20,000 cm(-1). Recent
   experimental data at 1.1 mu m has confirmed the predicted intensities
   for the 50013-00001 and 50014-00001 band transitions have better than
   90\% agreement. Comparisons are made against the Wattson 750 K line list
   and HITEMP/HITRAN at 300 K, 500 K, 725 K, 1000 K, 1500 K, 2000 K and
   3000 K. The temperature dependence and accuracy of the new Ames-296
   K/1000 K line lists are investigated and we claim both line lists are
   capable of providing reliable opacities up to 18,00023,000 cm(-1), while
   the highest applicable wavenumber range drops as T rises. We suggest
   caution is used for T> 1000 K simulations. Comparison to recent
   experiments at 1000 K, 1550 K and 1773 K shows that the Ames-1000 K line
   list and HITEMP perform similarly in the 3200-3800 cm(-1) and 4600-5200
   cm-1 ranges. In the 2000-2100 cm(-1) range, Ames-1000 K yields better
   agreement relative to experiment. Existing problems and possible future
   solutions in the new Ames-296 K/1000 K line lists for line positions and
   intensities are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A scanning differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument for
   identification of carbon dioxide leaks at carbon sequestration sites has
   been developed and initial data has been collected at Montana State
   University. The laser transmitter uses two tunable discrete mode laser
   diodes operating in the continuous-wave mode with one locked to the
   online absorption wavelength and the other operating at the offline
   wavelength. Two in-line fiber optic switches are used to switch between
   online and offline operation. After the fiber optic switch, an
   acousto-optic modulator is used to generate a pulse train used to
   injection seed an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to produce eye-safe laser
   pulses with maximum pulse energies of 66 mu J, a pulse repetition
   frequency of 15 kHz, and an operating wavelength of 1.571 mu m. The DIAL
   receiver uses a 28 cm diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to collect
   that backscattered light, which is then monitored using a
   photomultiplier tube module operating in the photon counting mode. The
   DIAL has measured carbon dioxide profiles from 1 to 2.5 km with 60 min
   temporal averaging. Comparisons of DIAL measurements with a Licor LI-820
   gas analyzer point sensor have been made. }},

Title = {{High-temperature measurements of VUV-absorption cross sections of CO$_2$
   and their application to exoplanets}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{551}},
pages = {A131},
Abstract = {{Context. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption cross sections are an essential
   ingredient of photochemical atmosphere models. Exoplanet searches have
   unveiled a large population of short-period objects with hot
   atmospheres, very different from what we find in our solar system.
   Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can now be studied by transit
   spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and have typical
   temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV
   photolysis cross section data are severely lacking.
   Aims. Our goal is to provide high-temperature absorption cross sections
   and their temperature dependency for important atmospheric compounds.
   This study is dedicated to CO2, which is observed and photodissociated
   in exoplanet atmospheres. We also investigate the influence of these new
   data on the photochemistry of some exoplanets.
   Methods. We performed these measurements with synchrotron radiation as a
   tunable VUV light source for the 115-200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and
   550 K. In the 195-230 nm range, we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5 m
   Jobin-Yvon spectrometer and we worked at seven temperatures between 465
   and 800 K. We implemented the measured cross section into a 1D
   photochemical model.
   Results. For lambda > 170 nm, the wavelength dependence of ln(sigma(CO2)
   (lambda,T) x 1/Q(v)(T)) can be parametrized with a linear law. Thus, we
   can interpolate sigma(CO2) (lambda,T) at any temperature between 300 and
   800 K. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross section
   can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,
   makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230
   nm, while it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K.
   Conclusions. The absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to
   temperature, especially above 160 nm. The model predicts that accounting
   for this temperature dependency of CO2 cross section can affect the
   computed abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by one order of magnitude in the
   atmospheres of hot Jupiter and hot Neptune. This effect will be more
   important in hot CO2-dominated atmospheres.}},

  abstract = {An isotopic-independent, highly accurate potential energy surface
	(PES) has been determined for CO2 by refining a purely ab initio
	PES with selected, purely experimentally determined rovibrational
	energy levels. The purely ab initio PES is denoted Ames-0, while
	the refined PES is denoted Ames-1. Detailed tests are performed to
	demonstrate the spectroscopic accuracy of the Ames-1 PES. It is shown
	that Ames-1 yields sigma(rms) (root-mean-squares error) = 0.0156
	cm(-1) for 6873 J = 0-117 (CO2)-C-12-O-16 experimental energy levels,
	even though less than 500 (CO2)-C-12-O-16 energy levels were included
	in the refinement procedure. It is also demonstrated that, without
	any additional refinement, Ames-1 yields very good agreement for
	isotopologues. Specifically, for the (CO2)-C-12-O-16 and (CO2)-C-13-O-16
	isotopologues, spectroscopic constants G(nu) computed from Ames-1
	are within +/- 0.01 and 0.02 cm(-1) of reliable experimentally derived
	values, while for the (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-18, (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-17,
	(OCO)-O-16-C-13-O-18, (OCO)-O-16-C-13-O-17, (CO2)-C-12-O-18, (OCO)-O-17-C-12-O-18,

	0.10 and 0.15 cm(-1). To our knowledge, this is the first time a
	polyatomic PES has been refined using such high J values, and this
	has led to new challenges in the refinement procedure. An initial
	high quality, purely ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is constructed
	and used to generate a 296 K line list. For most bands, experimental
	IR intensities are well reproduced for (CO2)-C-12-O-16 using Ames-1
	and the DMS. For more than 80\% of the bands, the experimental intensities
	are reproduced with sigma(rms)(Delta I) < 20\% or srms(Delta I/delta(obs))
	< 5. A few exceptions are analyzed and discussed. Directions for
	future improvements are discussed, though it is concluded that the
	current Ames-1 and the DMS should be useful in analyzing and assigning
	high-resolution laboratory or astronomical spectra. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{The radiocarbon content of whole air provides a theoretically ideal and

   CO2 in the atmosphere (C-ff). Over large industrialized land areas,
   determination of C-ff also constrains the change in CO2 due to uptake
   and release by the terrestrial biosphere. Here, we review the
   development of a Delta(CO2)-C-14 measurement program and its
   implementation within the US portion of the NOAA Global Monitoring
   Division's air sampling network. The Delta(CO2)-C-14 measurement
   repeatability is evaluated based on surveillance cylinders of whole air
   and equates to a C-ff detection limit of <= 0.9 ppm from measurement
   uncertainties alone. We also attempt to quantify additional sources of
   uncertainty arising from non-fossil terms in the atmospheric (CO2)-C-14
   budget and from uncertainties in the composition of ``background{''} air
   against which C-ff enhancements occur. As an example of how we apply the
   measurements, we present estimates of the boundary layer enhancements of
   C-ff and Cb-io using observations obtained from vertical airborne
   sampling profiles off of the northeastern US. We also present an updated
   time series of measurements from NOAA GMD's Niwot Ridge site at 3475 m

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important man-made greenhouse gas (GHG)
   that cause global warming. With electricity generation through
   fossil-fuel power plants now being the economic sector with the largest
   source of CO2, power plant emissions monitoring has become more
   important than ever in the fight against global warming. In a previous
   study done by Bovensmann et al. (2010), random and systematic errors of
   power plant CO2 emissions have been quantified using a single overpass
   from a proposed CarbonSat instrument. In this study, we quantify errors
   of power plant annual emission estimates from a hypothetical CarbonSat
   and constellations of several CarbonSats while taking into account that
   power plant CO2 emissions are time-dependent. Our focus is on estimating
   systematic errors arising from the sparse temporal sampling as well as
   random errors that are primarily dependent on wind speeds. We used
   hourly emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   combined with assimilated and re-analyzed meteorological fields from the
   National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP). CarbonSat orbits
   were simulated as a sun-synchronous low-earth orbiting satellite (LEO)
   with an 828-km orbit height, local time ascending node (LTAN) of 13:30
   (01:30 p.m. LT) and achieves global coverage after 5 days. We show, that
   despite the variability of the power plant emissions and the limited
   satellite overpasses, one CarbonSat has the potential to verify reported
   US annual CO2 emissions from large power plants (>= 5 MtCO(2) yr(-1))
   with a systematic error of less than similar to 4.9\% and a random error
   of less than similar to 6.7\% for 50\% of all the power plants. For 90\%
   of all the power plants, the systematic error was less than similar to
   12.4\% and the random error was less than similar to 13 \%. We
   additionally investigated two different satellite configurations using a
   combination of 5 CarbonSats. One achieves global coverage everyday but
   only samples the targets at fixed local times. The other configuration
   samples the targets five times at two-hour intervals approximately every
   6th day but only achieves global coverage after 5 days. From the
   statistical analyses, we found, as expected, that the random errors
   improve by approximately a factor of two if 5 satellites are used. On
   the other hand, more satellites do not result in a large reduction of
   the systematic error. The systematic error is somewhat smaller for the
   CarbonSat constellation configuration achieving global coverage
   everyday. Therefore, we recommend the CarbonSat constellation
   configuration that achieves daily global coverage.}},

   This is done in the bands near 1.6 and 2.1 mu m which will be used by
   the Greenhouse Gases Observatory Satellite (GOSAT) instrument and
   eventual successors of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO). A purely
   theoretical analysis is first made, based on simulations of atmospheric
   spectra. It shows that line mixing cannot be neglected since
   disregarding this process induces significant errors in the calculated
   absorption coefficients, leading to systematic structures in the
   spectral fit residuals and airmass-dependent biases in the retrieved CO2
   amounts. These theoretical predictions are then confirmed by using
   atmospheric solar-absorption spectra measured by a ground-based Fourier
   transform spectrometer. It is first shown that including line mixing in
   the forward model used for the inversion leads to a very significant
   reduction of the residuals in the 2.1 mu m region. Secondly, the
   inclusion of line mixing reduces the dependence of the retrieved CO2 on
   the airmass and greatly improves the consistency between values obtained
   independently from spectra in the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m bands. These results
   open promising prospects for various ground-based and space-borne

Abstract = {{We propose an improved monitoring scheme for the instrumental line shape
   (ILS) of high-resolution, ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed)
   spectrometers used for chemical monitoring of the atmosphere by the
   Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). Good
   ILS knowledge is required for the analysis of the recorded mid-infrared
   spectra. The new method applies a sequence of measurements using
   different gas cells instead of a single calibration cell. Three cells
   are used: cell C1 is a refillable cell offering 200 mm path length and
   equipped with a pressure gauge (filled with 100 Pa N2O), cells C2 and C3
   are sealed cells offering 75 mm path length. C2 is filled with 5 Pa of
   pure N2O. Cell C3 is filled with 16 Pa N2O in 200 hPa technical air, so
   provides pressure-broadened N2O lines. We demonstrate that an ILS
   retrieval using C1 improves significantly the sensitivity of the ILS
   retrieval over the current calibration cells used in the network,
   because this cell provides narrow fully saturated N2O lines. The N2O
   columns derived from C2 and C3 allow the performance of a highly
   valuable closure experiment: adopting the ILS retrieved from C1, the N2O
   columns of C2 and C3 are derived. Because N2O is an inert gas, both
   columns should be constant on long timescales. Apparent changes in the
   columns would immediately attract attention and indicate either
   inconsistent ILS results or instrumental problems of other origin. Two
   different cells are applied for the closure experiment, because the
   NDACC spectrometers observe both stratospheric and tropospheric gases:
   C2 mimics signatures of stratospheric gases, whereas C3 mimics
   signatures of tropospheric gases.}}}

    abstract = {{An algorithm is developed to retrieve the vertical profile of carbon dioxide in the 5 to 25 km altitude range using mid-infrared solar occultation spectra from the main instrument of the ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) mission, namely the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS). The main challenge is to find an atmospheric phenomenon which can be used for accurate tangent height determination in the lower atmosphere, where the tangent heights (THs) calculated from geometric and timing information are not of sufficient accuracy. Error budgets for the retrieval of CO2 from ACE-FTS and the FTS on a potential follow-on mission named CASS (Chemical and Aerosol Sounding Satellite) are calculated and contrasted. Retrieved THs have typical biases of 60 m relative to those retrieved using the ACE version 3.x software after revisiting the temperature dependence of the N2 CIA (collision-induced absorption) laboratory measurements and accounting for sulfate aerosol extinction. After correcting for the known residual high bias of ACE version 3.x THs expected from CO2 spectroscopic/isotopic inconsistencies, the remaining bias for tangent heights determined with the N2 CIA is -20 m. CO2 in the 5-13 km range in the 2009-2011 time frame is validated against aircraft measurements from CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container), CONTRAIL (Comprehensive Observation Network for Trace gases by Airline), and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations), yielding typical biases of -1.7 ppm in the 5-13 km range. The standard error of these biases in this vertical range is 0.4 ppm. The multi-year ACE-FTS data set is valuable in determining the seasonal variation of the latitudinal gradient which arises from the strong seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere. The annual growth of CO2 in this time frame is determined to be 2.6 ± 0.4 ppm year-1, in agreement with the currently accepted global growth rate based on ground-based measurements. }},

Abstract = {{The objective, design, and implementation of the OCO inverse method are
   presented. The inverse method is the algorithm which finds the
   profile-weighted mean mixing ratio, X-CO2, which best fits the measured
   spectrum, given a ``forward model'' which calculates the spectrum for a
   given atmospheric state, surface, and instrument properties. Minimizing
   bias among comparative values of X-CO2 is a critical objective. The
   algorithm uses an ``optimal,'' maximum a posteriori inverse method, with
   weak a priori constraint, and employs a state vector containing
   atmospheric and surface properties expected to vary significantly
   between soundings. An extensive operational characterization and error
   analysis will be employed, producing quantities designed to aid
   atmospheric modelers in use of the OCO data. In particular, comparison
   to inverse models of surface CO2 flux will require use of the OCO column
   averaging kernel and a priori state vector. An off-line error analysis
   has also been developed for more detailed error studies, and its use is
   illustrated by prospective application to case studies of nadir
   observations in summer and winter at three sites. Uncertainties due to
   noise, geophysical variability, and spectroscopic parameters are
   considered in detail. At low and midlatitudes, the single-sounding
   errors due to these sources are expected to be similar to 0.7-0.8 ppm

Abstract = {{In a previous series of papers, a model for the calculation of CO2-air

   the 2008 version of HITRAN, the latest currently available. The
   spectroscopic data for the seven most-abundant isotopologues are taken
   from HITRAN. When the HITRAN data are not complete up to J `'=70, the
   data files are augmented with spectroscopic parameters from the CD5D-296
   database and the high-temperature CDSD-1000 if necessary. Previously
   missing spectroscopic parameters, the air-induced pressure shifts and
   CO2 line broadening coefficients with H2O, have been added. The quality
   of this new database is demonstrated by comparisons of calculated
   absorptions and measurements using CO2 high-pressure laboratory spectra
   in the 1.5-2.3 mu m region. The influence of the imperfections and
   inaccuracies of the spectroscopic parameters from the 2000 version of
   HITRAN is clearly shown as a big improvement of the residuals is
   observed by using the new database. The very good agreements between
   calculated and measured absorption coefficients confirm the necessity of
   the update presented here and further demonstrate the importance of
   line-mixing effects, especially for the high pressures investigated
   here. The application of the updated database/software package to
   atmospheric spectra should result in an increased accuracy in the
   retrieval of CO2 atmospheric amounts. This opens improved perspectives

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
   throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the
   links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface
   temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the
   early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been
   higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon
   dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are
   most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological
   timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic
   foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water
   throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more
   than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods
   (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and rnd an erratic decline between 55 and
   40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from
   ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon
   burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2
   concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more
   stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may
   have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr

A consistent σRMS=±0.02 cm−1 is established for hundreds of isotopologue band origins using the Ames-2 PES. Ames-2016 line lists are computed at 296K, 1000K and 4000K using the Ames-2 \{PES\} and the same DMS-N2 dipole surface used previously, with J up to 150, E’ up to 24,000 cm−1 or 18,000 cm−1 and appropriate intensity cutoffs. The lists are compared to the CDSD-296, CDSD-4000 databases, \{UCL\} line lists, and a few recent highly accurate \{CO2\} intensity measurements. Both agreements and discrepancies are discussed. Compared to the old Ames \{CO2\} lists, the Ames-2016 line lists have line position deviations reduced by 50\% or more, which consequently leads to more reliable intensities. The line shape parameters in the Ames-2016 line lists are predicted using the newly assigned conventional vibrational polyad quantum numbers for rovibrational levels below 12,000 cm−1 so the quality of the line shape parameters is similar to that of \{CDSD\} or HITRAN. This study further proves that a semi-empirically refined \{PES\} (Ames-1 and Ames-2) coupled with a high quality ab initio \{DMS\} (DMS-N2 and UCL) may generate \{IR\} predictions with consistent accuracy and is thus helpful in the analysis of laboratory spectra and simulations of various isotopologues. The Ames-2016 lists based on DMS-N2 have reached the ∼1\% intensity prediction accuracy level for the recent 626 30013-00001 and 20013-00001 bands, but further quantification and future improvements requires sub-percent or sub-half-percent accurate experimental intensities. The inter-isotopologue consistency of the intensity prediction accuracies should have reached better than 1-3\% for regular bands not affected by resonances. Since the Effective Dipole Models (EDM) in \{CDSD\} and \{HITRAN\} have 1 – 20\% or even larger uncertainties, we show that the Ames lists can provide better alternative \{IR\} data for many hard-to-determine isotopologue bands. Comparison at 4000 K suggests that the Ames-4000K 12C16O2 line list is reliable and consistent within the current cutoffs of J ≤150 and E’ ≤24,000 cm−1, but intensity contributions involving higher energy levels should not be omitted and future computations need to be converged up to at least 32,000 cm−1 or higher. The remaining issues are discussed regarding the source of energy level discrepancies, intensity underestimations by ∼50\% for some weak bands, etc. and also future work. "

   our understanding of line shape parameters for carbon dioxide and

   cavity within a temperature- regulated enclosure, which is interrogated
   by a tunable, single-frequency diode laser. We experimentally
   characterize and model the dependence of the spectrum detuning axis at
   each setpoint temperature, and show that absolute frequencies are stable
   to within 200 kHz over several hours, corresponding to temperature
   stabilities better than 1 mK. We measure the R16e (30013-0001)
   (CO2)-C-12-O-16 transition and carry out multi-spectrum analyses using
   two line profiles incorporating speed-dependent (quadratic
   approximation) and Dicke narrowing (hard collision assumption) effects.
   The resulting broadening coefficient and temperature exponent are in
   excellent agreement (0.05\% level) with previous high-resolution
