Pages = {407-411},
Abstract = {The time-delayed resonant two-photon ionization method has been used to
   measure the radiative lifetimes of the upsilon = 0 and 1 levels of the A
   (6)Sigma(+) state of CrH, yielding values of 0.939 +/- 0.019 and 1.027
   +/- 0.066 mus, respectively (1 sigma error limits). These measured
   lifetimes are about 16\%-45\% longer than those obtained in recent ab
   initio calculations, a result that is important for modeling of the
   atmospheric concentration of CrH in the class of substellar objects
   known as brown dwarfs. Based on these results, it is suggested that the
   line strengths used to calculate the opacity function used by
   astronomers should be reduced by a factor of 0.799. In addition, line
   positions are reported for the 0-0 band of the A (6)Sigma(+)-X
   (6)Sigma(+) system of the minor isotope (CrH)-Cr-50, along with a
   least-squares fit of the lines to the standard matrix Hamiltonian.},

Pages = {988-1002},
Abstract = {Using previous measurements and quantum chemical calculations to derive
   the molecular properties of the TiH molecule, we obtain new values for
   its rovibrational constants, thermochemical data, spectral line lists,
   line strengths, and absorption opacities. Furthermore, we calculate the
   abundance of TiH in M and L dwarf atmospheres and conclude that it is
   much higher than previously thought. We find that the TiH/TiO ratio
   increases strongly with decreasing metallicity, and at high temperatures
   can exceed unity. We suggest that, particularly for subdwarf L and M
   dwarfs, spectral features of TiH near \&SIM; 0.52 and 0.94 \&mu; m and
   in the H band may be more easily measurable than heretofore thought. The
   recent possible identification in the L subdwarf 2MASS J0532 of the 0.94
   \&mu; m feature of TiH is in keeping with this expectation. We speculate
   that looking for TiH in other dwarfs and subdwarfs will shed light on
   the distinctive titanium chemistry of the atmospheres of substellar-mass
   objects and the dimmest stars.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {8194-8200},
Abstract = {Ab initio calculations of low-lying electronic states of CrH are

   (6)Sigma(+), 3 (6)Sigma(+), 1 (6)Pi, 2 (6)Pi, 3 (6)Pi, and (6)Delta.
   Calculation of dynamic correlation effects was performed using the
   multistate complete active space second-order perturbation method, based
   on state-averaged complete active space self-consistent-field reference
   wave functions obtained with seven active electrons in an active space
   of 16 molecular orbitals. A relativistic atomic natural orbital-type
   basis set from the MOLCAS library was used for Cr. Good agreement is
   found between the current calculations and experiment for the lowest two
   (6)Sigma(+) states, the only states for which spectroscopic data are
   available. Potential curves for the 3 (6)Sigma(+) and 2 (6)Pi states are
   complicated by avoided crossings with higher states of the same
   symmetry, thus resulting in double-well structures for these two states.
   The measured bandhead T-0=27 181 cm(-1), previously assigned to a
   (6)Pi<--X (6)Sigma(+) transition, is close to our value of T-0=28 434
   cm(-1) for the 2 (6)Pi state. We tentatively assign the ultraviolet band
   found experimentally at 30 386 cm-1 to the 3 (6)Pi<--X (6)Sigma(+)
   transition for which the computed value is 29 660 cm-1. The A
   (6)Sigma(+)<--X (6)Sigma(+) TDM and A (6)Sigma(+) lifetimes are found to
   be in reasonable agreement with previous calculations. (C) 2004 American

Pages = {2560-2570},
Abstract = {The dissociation curves of low-lying spin-mixed states in monohydrides
   of groups 6 and 7 were calculated by using an effective core potential
   (ECP) approach. This approach is based on the multiconfiguration
   self-consistent field (MCSCF) method, followed by first-order
   configuration interaction (FOCI) calculations, in which the method
   employs an ECP basis set proposed by Stevens and co-workers (SBKJC)
   augmented by a set of polarization functions. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
   effects are estimated within the one-electron approximation by using
   effective nuclear charges, since SOC splittings obtained with the full
   Breit-Pauli Hamitonian are underestimated when ECP basis sets are used.
   The ground states of group 6 hydrides have Omega = 1/2
   (X(6)Sigma(1/2)(+)), where Omega is the z component of the total angular
   momentum quantum number. Although the ground states of group 7 hydrides
   have Tau = 01, their main adiabatic components are different; the ground
   state in Muff originates from the lowest (7)Sigma(+), while in TcH and
   ReH the main component of the ground state is the lowest (5)Sigma(+).
   The present paper reports a comprehensive set of theoretical results
   including the dissociation energies, equilibrium distances, electronic
   transition energies, harmonic frequencies, anharmonicities, and
   rotational constants for several low-lying spin-mixed states in these
   hydrides. Transition dipole moments were also computed among the
   spin-mixed states and large peak positions of electronic transitions are
   suggested theoretically for these hydrides. The periodic trends of
   physical properties of metal hydrides are discussed, based on the
   results reported in this and other recent studies.},

   2MASS 1047+2124. None of the T dwarfs exhibit Li I absorption. Guided by
   the evolution of optical spectral features with near-infrared spectral
   type, we derive a parallel optical classification scheme, focusing on
   spectral types T5 to T8, anchored to select spectral standards. We find
   general agreement between optical and near-infrared types for nearly all

   within our classification uncertainties (similar to1 subtype). These
   results suggest that competing gravity and temperature effects
   compensate for each other over the 0.6-2.5 mum spectral region. We
   identify one possible means of disentangling these effects by comparing
   the strength of the K I red wing to the 9250 Angstrom H2O band. One of
   our objects, 2MASS 0937+2931, exhibits a peculiar spectrum with a
   substantial red slope and relatively strong FeH absorption, both
   consequences of a metal-deficient atmosphere. On the basis of its

   an important role in the diagnosis of low-temperature atmospheres. As a
   tentative first application of these opacities, we employ our new

   off by more than an order of magnitude, this agreement represents a
   modest advance. However, in order to fit the CrH abundance in the L

   molecule is computed in the JOLA approximation. The spectrum of the
   young brown dwarf Teide 1 is studied in the interval lambda lambda
   6650-9000 Angstrom, which contains the (0-0) band of the
   A(6)Sigma((+))-X(6)Sigma((+)) system. An upper limit for the oscillator
   strength of the CrH molecular bands for this system is estimated by
   comparing observed and computed spectra for Teide 1 (f(e)=0.001-0.002).
   Problems in modeling CrH molecular absorption bands in the spectra of
   other, cooler objects (L dwarfs) are discussed.},

   Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively
   correct description of the bond dissociation. We found that on average

   are closer to experiment than those obtained with high level wave
   function theory methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the
   fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased.
   Natural bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the
   details of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference

   correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
   individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
   values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure

   the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
   and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized

Volume = {133},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Title = {Measuring magnetic fields in ultracool stars and brown dwarfs},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {644},
Pages = {497-509},
Abstract = {We present a new method for direct measurement of magnetic fields on
   ultracool stars and brown dwarfs. It takes advantage of the Wing-Ford
   bands of FeH, which are seen throughout the M and L spectral types.
   These molecular features are not as blended as other optical molecular
   bands, are reasonably strong through most of the spectral range, and
   exhibit a response to magnetic fields that is easier to detect than
   other magnetic diagnostics, including the usual optical and
   near-infrared atomic spectral lines that have heretofore been employed.
   The FeH bands show a systematic growth as the star gets cooler. We do
   not find any contamination by CrH in the relevant spectral region. We
   are able to model cool and rapidly rotating spectra from warmer, slowly
   rotating spectra utilizing an interpolation scheme based on
   curve-of-growth analysis. We show that the FeH features can distinguish
   between negligible, moderate, and high magnetic fluxes on low-mass
   dwarfs, with a current accuracy of about 1 kG. Two different approaches
   to extracting the information from the spectra are developed and
   compared. Which one is superior depends on a number of factors. We
   demonstrate the validity of our new procedures by comparing the spectra
   of three M stars whose magnetic fluxes are already known from atomic
   line analysis. The low- and high-field stars are used to produce
   interpolated moderate-strength spectra that closely resemble the
   moderate-field star. The assumption of linear behavior for the magnetic
   effects appears to be reasonable, but until the molecular constants are
   better understood, the method is subject to that assumption and rather
   approximate. Nonetheless, it opens a new regime of very low mass objects
   to direct confirmation and testing of their magnetic dynamos.},

   analyzes: the data in terms of the present method. This method of
   analysis therefore detects at which angular moments the irregularities
   occur in the data and such information would be most useful for
   understanding the nature of the perturbation which is responsible for

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{558}},
Abstract = {{Aims. We investigated the Paschen-Back effect in the (0,0) band of the
   A(6)Sigma(+)-X-6 Sigma(+) system of the CrH molecule, and we examined
   its potential for estimating magnetic fields on stars and substellar
   objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot exoplanets.
   Methods. We carried out quantum mechanical calculations to obtain the
   energy level structure of the electronic-vibrational-rotational states
   considered both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field.
   Level mixing due to magnetic field perturbation (the Paschen-Back
   effect) was consistently taken into account. Then, we calculated
   frequencies and strengths of transitions between magnetic sublevels.
   Employing these results and solving numerically a set of the radiative
   transfer equations for polarized radiation, we calculated Stokes
   parameters for both the individual lines and the (0, 0) band depending
   on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field.
   Results. We demonstrate that magnetic splitting of the individual CrH
   lines shows a significant asymmetry due to the Paschen-Back effect
   already at 1 G field. This leads to a considerable signal in both
   circular and linear polarization, up to 30\% at the magnetic field
   strength of >= 3 kG in early L dwarfs. The polarization does not cancel
   out completely even at very low spectral resolution and is seen as
   broad-band polarization of a few percent. Since the line asymmetry
   depends only on the magnetic field strength and not on the filling
   factor, CrH lines provide a very sensitive tool for direct measurement
   of the stellar magnetic fields on faint cool objects, such as brown
   dwarfs and hot Jupiters, observed with low spectral resolution.}},
