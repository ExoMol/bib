abstract ={{Photometric stability is a key requirement for
time-resolved spectroscopic observations of transiting extrasolar
planets. In the context of the Exoplanet Characterisation Ob-
servatory (EChO) mission design, we here present and investigate means
of translating space-craft pointing instabilities as well as
temperature 
uctuation of its optical chain into an overall error
budget of the exoplanetary spectrum to be retrieved. Given the
instrument specications as of date, we investigate the magnitudes of
these photomet- ric instabilities in the context of simulated
observations of the exoplanet HD189733b secondary eclipse.}}  }
