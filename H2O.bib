Abstract = {We have performed a detailed ab initio computation of the dipole moment

   the water molecule. A total of 412 vibrational eigenstates were
   identified below 30 000 cm(-1), corresponding to approximate to 85 000
   vibrational transitions. In principle there are many billions of
   allowed vibration-rotation transitions between these eigenstates. In
   our most complete test calculations we constructed a list of 3 billion
   (3 x 10(9)) lines. At room temperature, the computed monochromatic
   absorption coefficient is in good overall agreement with the HITRAN
   data base, while at higher temperatures its value exceeds the
   HITRAN-based absorption coefficient by more than an order of magnitude,
   due to the lack of high excitation lines in HITRAN. The agreement with
   the HITEMP version of HITRAN is considerably better than with the
   standard HITRAN. By comparing stellar model atmospheric structures and
   synthetic spectra based on our most extensive line list with results
   from calculations excluding the huge number of ultra-weak lines, we
   conclude that when the lines are well chosen, a few times 10 million
   lines are more than sufficient for all astrophysical purposes. We
   therefore offer to the community a line list of 100 million lines,
   easily accessible by anonymous ftp. Finally, we have compared results
   of synthetic stellar spectra based on this line list with observed ISO
   spectra and have found good agreement. In particular in the 2-4 mum
   region around the strong fundamental bands, the agreement with
   observations is considerably better than that obtained with other
   available water line lists.}}

Title = {{Systematic trend of water vapour absorption in red giant atmospheres
   revealed by high resolution TEXES 12 mu m spectra}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{573}},
Abstract = {{Context. The structures of the outer atmospheres of red giants are very
   complex. Recent interpretations of a range of different observations
   have led to contradictory views of these regions. It is clear, however,
   that classical model photospheres are inadequate to describe the nature
   of the outer atmospheres. The notion of large optically thick molecular
   spheres around the stars (MOLspheres) has been invoked in order to
   explain spectro-interferometric observations and low-and high-resolution
   spectra. On the other hand high-resolution spectra in the mid-IR do not
   easily fit into this picture because they rule out any large sphere of
   water vapour in LTE surrounding red giants.   Aims. In order to approach a unified scenario for these outer regions of
   red giants, more empirical evidence from different diagnostics are
   needed. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-IR spectra
   for a range of red giants, spanning spectral types from early K to mid
   M. We want to study how the pure rotational lines of water vapour change
   with effective temperature, and whether we can find common properties
   that can put new constraints on the modelling of these regions, so that
   we can gain new insights.
   Methods. We have recorded mid-IR spectra at 12.2-12.4 mu m at high
   spectral resolution of ten well-studied bright red giants, with TEXES
   mounted on the IRTF on Mauna Kea. These stars span effective
   temperatures from 3450 K to 4850 K.
   Results. We find that all red giants in our study cooler than 4300 K,
   spanning a wide range of effective temperatures (down to 3450 K), show
   water absorption lines stronger than expected and none are detected in
   emission, in line with what has been previously observed for a few
   stars. The strengths of the lines vary smoothly with spectral type. We
   identify several spectral features in the wavelength region that are
   undoubtedly formed in the photosphere. From a study of water-line ratios
   of the stars, we find that the excitation temperatures, in the
   line-forming regions, are several hundred Kelvin lower than expected
   from a classical photospheric model.
   Conclusions. All stars in our sample show several photospheric features
   in their 12 mu m spectra, which can be modelled with a classical model
   photosphere. However, in all stars showing water-vapour lines (stars
   cooler than similar to 4300 K), the water lines are found to be much
   deeper than expected. The line ratios of these pure-rotational lines
   reveal low excitation temperatures. This could either be due to lower
   temperatures than expected in the outer regions of the photospheres
   caused by for example extra cooling, or due to non-LTE level
   populations, affecting the source function and line opacities, but this
   needs further investigation. We have demonstrated that these
   diagnostically interesting water lines are a general feature of red
   giants across spectral types, and we argue for a general explanation of
   their formation rather than explanations requiring specific properties,
   such as dust. Since the water lines are neither weak (filled in by
   emission) nor do they appear in emission, as predicted by LTE MOLsphere
   models in their simplest forms, the evidence of the existence of such
   large optically-thick, molecular spheres enshrouding the stars is
   weakened. It is still a challenge to find a unifying picture of the
   outer regions of the atmospheres of red giants, but we have presented
   new empirical evidence that needs to be taken into account and explained
   in any model of these regions.}},

   giant branch star IRC+10216 (a.k.a. CW Leonis) using the HIFI instrument
   on the Herschel Space Observatory. This search was motivated by the fact
   that any detection of isotopic enhancement in the (H2O)-O-17 and
   (H2O)-O-18 abundances would have strongly implicated CO
   photodissociation as the source of the atomic oxygen needed to produce
   water in a carbon-rich circumstellar envelope. Our observations place an
   upper limit of 1/470 on the (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-16 abundance ratio.
   Given the isotopic O-17/O-16 ratio of 1/840 inferred previously for the
   photosphere of IRC+10216, this result places an upper limit of a factor
   1.8 on the extent of any isotope-selective enhancement of (H2O)-O-17 in
   the circumstellar material, and provides an important constraint on any
   model that invokes CO photodissociation as the source of O for H2O
   production. In the context of the clumpy photodissociation model
   proposed previously for the origin of water in IRC+10216, our limit
   implies that (CO)-C-12-O-16 ( not (CO)-C-13-O-16 or SiO) must be the
   dominant source of O-16 for H2O production, and that the effects of
   self-shielding can only have reduced the (CO)-C-12-O-16
   photodissociation rate by at most a factor similar to 2.}},

Pages = {2031-2048},
Abstract = {{We review current observational and theoretical constraints on the
   galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of oxygen isotopes to explore whether
   GCE plays a role in explaining the lower 17O/18O ratio of the Sun,
   relative to the present-day interstellar medium, or the existence of
   distinct 16O-rich and 16O-poor reservoirs in the solar system. Although
   the production of both 17O and 18O are related to the metallicity of
   progenitor stars, 17O is most likely produced in stars that evolve on
   longer timescales than those that produce 18O. Therefore, the 17O/18O
   ratio need not have remained constant over time, contrary to
   preconceptions and the simplest models of GCE. An apparent linear,
   slope-one correlation between delta 17O and delta 18O in the ISM need
   not necessarily reflect an O isotopic gradient, and any slope-one
   galactocentric gradient need not correspond to evolution in time.
   Instead, increasing 17O/18O is consistent both with observational data
   from molecular clouds and with modeling of the compositions of presolar
   grains. Models in which the rate of star formation has decelerated over
   the past few Gyr or in which an enhanced period of star formation
   occurred shortly before solar birth (starburst) can explain the
   solar-ISM O-isotopic difference without requiring a local input of
   supernova ejecta into the protosolar cloud. Cosmic chemical memory
   models in which interstellar dust is on average older than interstellar
   gas predict that primordial solar system solids should be 16O-rich,
   relative to the Sun, in conflict with observations. However, scenarios
   can be constructed in which the 16O-rich contribution of very massive
   stars could lead to 16O-poor solids and a 16O-rich bulk Sun, if the
   solar system formed shortly after a starburst, independent of the
   popular scenario of photochemical self-shielding of CO.}},

Abstract = {{An IDP nicknamed Andric, from a stratospheric dust collector targeted to
   collect dust from comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, contains five distinct
   presolar silicate and/or oxide grains in 14 ultramicrotome slices
   analyzed, for an estimated abundance of approximately 700 ppm in this
   IDP. Three of the grains are 17O-enriched and probably formed in
   low-mass red giant or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars; the other two
   grains exhibit 18O enrichments and may have a supernova origin. Carbon
   and N isotopic analyses show that Andric also exhibits significant
   variations in its N isotopic composition, with numerous discrete
   15N-rich hotspots and more diffuse regions that are also isotopically
   anomalous. Three 15N-rich hotspots also have statistically significant
   13C enrichments. Auger elemental analysis shows that these isotopically
   anomalous areas consist largely of carbonaceous matter and that the
   anomalies may be hosted by a variety of components. In addition, there
   is evidence for dilution of the isotopically heavy components with an
   isotopically normal endmember; this may have occurred either as a result
   of extraterrestrial alteration or during atmospheric entry. Isotopically
   primitive IDPs such as Andric share many characteristics with primitive
   meteorites such as the CR chondrites, which also contain isotopically
   anomalous carbonaceous matter and abundant presolar silicate and oxide
   grains. Although comets are one likely source for the origin of
   primitive IDPs, the presence of similar characteristics in meteorites
   thought to come from the asteroid belt suggests that other origins are
   also possible. Indeed the distinction between cometary and asteroidal
   sources is somewhat blurred by recent observations of icy comet-like
   planetesimals in the outer asteroid belt.}},

Journal = {Meteorics Planet. Sci.},

Pages = {1998-2012},
Abstract = {{The composition of the most primitive solar system condensates, such as
   calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and micron-sized corundum
   grains, show that short-lived radionuclides (SLR), e.g., 26Al, were
   present in the early solar system. Their abundances require a local or
   stellar origin, which, however, is far from being understood. We present
   for the first time the abundances of several SLR up to 60Fe predicted
   from stars with initial mass in the range approximately 711 M circle
   dot. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning. After core C
   burning they go through a Super-asymptotic giant branch (Super-AGB)
   phase, with the H and He shells activated alternately, episodic thermal
   pulses in the He shell, a very hot temperature at the base of the
   convective envelope (approximately 108 K), and strong stellar winds
   driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding interstellar medium.
   The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB stars are mostly ONe
   white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce 26Al/27Al yield ratios
   approximately 0.020.26. These models can account for the canonical value
   of the 26Al/27Al ratio using dilutions with the solar nebula of the
   order of 1 part of Super-AGB mass per several 102 to several 103 of
   solar nebula mass, resulting in associated changes in the O-isotope
   composition in the range Delta 17O from 3 to 20 parts per thousand. This
   is in agreement with observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive
   solar system condensates, which do not carry the signature of a stellar
   polluter. The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron
   captures in Super-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also
   matched by some of our models, depending on the nuclear and stellar
   physics uncertainties as well as the meteoritic experimental data. We
   also expect and are currently investigating Super-AGB production of SLR
   heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the silicon isotopic compositions of 38 presolar
   silicate grains from the carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 094, which have
   been previously studied for oxygen isotopes. The goals of this study are
   to further disentangle stellar sources of the O-18-enriched (Group IV)
   and the most O-17-enriched (Group I) silicate grains and to put further
   constraints on the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of the Si isotopes.
   Our results show that the majority (6 out of 8) of the O-18 enriched
   silicates have enhanced Si-28, in qualitative agreement with the
   signature of presolar silicon carbide (SiC) X grains from supernovae.
   Three highly 17O-enriched grains (O-17/O-16 > 3 x 10(-3)) have close to
   solar Si-29/Si-28 but enhanced Si-30/Si-28, possibly indicating an
   origin in binary systems. Alternative stellar sources are 3.5-4 M-circle
   dot asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Si isotopic compositions of the
   majority of presolar silicates fall along the SiC mainstream line,
   although most grains plot to the Si-30-poor side of this line. Most
   presolar silicate grains therefore formed in red giant branch (RGB)/AGB
   stars of roughly solar metallicity, and incorporated less (or no) Si
   processed by slow neutron capture reactions ({''}s-process{''}) than
   presolar SiC grains, because silicates form before large amounts of C-12
   and s-processed material has been dredged up to the surface. The
   inferred shift of the Si isotopes due to the different dredge-up of
   matter from the He intershell in C-rich AGB stars is Delta Si-29 = 3
   parts per thousand-2 parts per thousand and Delta Si-30 = 17 parts per

   spectra, with one-third of the observed lines being attributable to H2O.
   Other detected species include CO, (CO)-C-13, (H2O)-O-18, SiO, HCN, SO,
   SO2, CS, H2S and NH3. Our model fits to the observed (CO)-C-12 and
   (CO)-C-13 line intensities yield a C-12/C-13 ratio of 5.6 +/- 1.8,
   consistent with measurements of this ratio for other M-supergiants, but
   significantly lower than previously estimated for VY CMa from
   observations of lower-J lines. The spectral line energy distribution for
   20 SiO rotational lines shows two temperature components: a hot
   component at similar to 1000 K, which we attribute to the stellar
   atmosphere and inner wind, plus a cooler similar to 200 K component,
   which we attribute to an origin in the outer circumstellar envelope. We
   fit the line fluxes of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, H2O and SiO, using the

   a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1) between 9R({*})

   along with a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1). To fit
   the high rotational lines of CO and H2O, the model required a rather
   flat temperature distribution inside the dust condensation radius,
   attributed to the high H2O opacity. Beyond the dust condensation radius
   the gas temperature is fitted best by an r(-0.5) radial dependence,

   the parameters for non-convective mixing on the red giant branch}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{548}},
Abstract = {{Context. We re-analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the
   atmospheres of the two bright K giants Arcturus (a Boo) and Aldebaran (a
   Tau).
   Aims. These stars are in the evolutionary stage following the first
   dredge-up (FDU). Previous determinations (dating back more than 20
   years) of their O-16/O-18 ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU
   expectations; however, the estimated O-16/O-17 and C-12/C-13 ratios were
   lower than in the canonical predictions for red giants. Today these
   anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of non-convective
   mixing episodes. We therefore re-investigated this problem to verify
   whether the observed data can be reproduced in this scenario and if the
   fairly well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing
   the uncertain parameters that characterize non-convective mixing and in
   constraining its physical nature.
   Methods. We used high-resolution infrared spectra from the literature to
   derive the C-12/C-13 and O-16/O-17/O-18 ratios from CO molecular lines
   near 5 mu m, using the local termodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectral
   synthesis method. We made use of the recently published ACE-FTS atlas of
   the infrared solar spectrum for constructing an updated atomic and
   molecular line lists in this spectral range. We also reconsidered the
   determination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric
   and evolutionary models.
   Results. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the two
   stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This
   reinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in
   these stars. By reproducing the observed elemental and isotopic
   abundances with the help of parametric models for the coupled occurrence
   of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived constraints on the
   properties of non-convective mixing, providing information on the so far
   elusive physics of these phenomena. We find that very slow mixing, like
   that associated to diffusive processes, is incapable of explaining the
   observed data, which require a fast transport. Circulation mechanisms
   with speeds intermediate between those typical of diffusive and
   convective mixing are necessary. We conclude with a word of caution on
   the conclusions possible at this stage however, as the parameters for
   the mass transport are fairly sensitive to the stellar mass and initial
   composition. At least for a Boo, reducing the uncertainty still
   remaining on these data would be highly desirable.}},

Abstract = {{We have adapted our in-cylinder Fourier-transform spectroscopy technique
   to measure absorption spectra in a reciprocating engine. Previously, we
   had used the technique for emission spectroscopy; the upgrade to
   absorption spectroscopy mode is important because it allows for more
   quantitative analysis of gas properties than is possible with emission
   spectroscopy. Here, we discuss fuel, H2O, and CO2 spectra measured in an
   engine using a spark-plug-based probe for optical access and use the
   water portion of the spectra to determine in-cylinder gas temperature.
   The temperature results show that heat transfer effects can
   significantly bias thermometry when fiber-coupled engine probes are
   used. }},

   (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observational Limit on the
   water abundance, together with detailed chemical models of translucent

   constrains the branching ratio in the dissociative recombination of H3O+
   to form water. We find at the 3 sigma level that no more than 30\% of
   dissociative recombinations of H3O+ can lead to H2O. The observed
   spectrum also yielded high-resolution observations of the Mg II doublet
   at 1239.9 Angstrom and 1240.4 Angstrom, allowing the velocity structure
   of the dominant ionization state of magnesium to be studied along the

Abstract = {{We present an application of absorption spectroscopy to directly measure
   temperature and concentration histories of water vapor within the
   expansion of a high explosive detonation. While the approach of
   absorption spectroscopy is well established, the combination of a fast,
   near-infrared array, broadband light source, and rigid gauge allow the
   first application of time-resolved absorption measurements in an
   explosive environment. The instrument is demonstrated using
   pentaerythritol tetranitrate with a sampling rate of 20 kHz for 20 ms
   following detonation. Absorption by water vapor is measured between 1335
   and 1380 nm. Water temperatures are determined by fitting experimental
   transmission spectra to a simulated database. Water mole fractions are
   deduced following the temperature assignment. The sources of uncertainty
   and their impact on the results are discussed. These measurements will
   aid the development of chemical-specific reaction models and the
   predictive capability in technical fields including combustion and
   detonation science.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {1799-1818},
Abstract = {{Measurements of the atmospheric HDO/H2O ratio help us to better
   understand the hydrological cycle and improve models to correctly
   simulate tropospheric humidity and therefore climate change. We present
   an updated version of the column-averaged HDO/H2O ratio data set from
   the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric
   CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). The data set is extended with 2 additional
   years, now covering 2003-2007, and is validated against co-located
   ground-based total column (delta D) over bar measurements from Fourier
   transform spectrometers (FTS) of the Total Carbon Column Observing
   Network (TCCON) and the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric
   Composition Change (NDACC, produced within the framework of the MUSICA
   project). Even though the time overlap among the available data is not
   yet ideal, we determined a mean negative bias in SCIAMACHY (delta D)
   over bar of -35 +/- 30\% compared to TCCON and -69 +/- 15\% compared to
   MUSICA (the uncertainty indicating the station-to-station standard
   deviation). The bias shows a latitudinal dependency, being largest
   (similar to-60 to -80 parts per thousand) at the highest latitudes and
   smallest (similar to-20 to -30\%) at the lowest latitudes. We have
   tested the impact of an offset correction to the SCIAMACHY HDO and H2O
   columns. This correction leads to a humidity-and latitude-dependent
   shift in (delta D) over bar and an improvement of the bias by 27 parts
   per thousand, although it does not lead to an improved correlation with
   the FTS measurements nor to a strong reduction of the latitudinal
   dependency of the bias. The correction might be an improvement for dry,
   high-altitude areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau and the Andes region.
   For these areas, however, validation is currently impossible due to a
   lack of ground stations. The mean standard deviation of single-sounding
   SCIAMACHY-FTS differences is similar to 115 parts per thousand, which is
   reduced by a factor similar to 2 when we consider monthly means. When we
   relax the strict matching of individual measurements and focus on the
   mean seasonalities using all available FTS data, we find that the
   correlation coefficients between SCIAMACHY and the FTS networks improve
   from 0.2 to 0.7-0.8. Certain ground stations show a clear asymmetry in
   (delta D) over bar during the transition from the dry to the wet season
   and back, which is also detected by SCIAMACHY. This asymmetry points to
   a transition in the source region temperature or location of the water
   vapour and shows the added information that HDO/H2O measurements provide
   when used in combination with variations in humidity.}},

Abstract = {{A complex coordinate scaling (CCS) method is described allowing the

   metastable) rovibrational states of strongly bound triatomic molecules.
   The molecule chosen to test the method is H-2 O-16, for which an
   accurate global potential energy surface, a previous computation of a
   few resonance states via the complex absorbing potential (CAP) method,
   and some Feshbach (J = 0, where J is the quantum number characterising
   overall rotations of the molecule) and shape (J 0) resonances measured
   via a state-selective, triple-resonance technique are all available.
   Characterisation of the computed resonance states is performed via
   probability density plots based on CCS rovibrational wavefunctions. Such
   plots provide useful details about the physical nature of the resonance
   states. Based on the computations and the resonance plots, the following
   useful facts about the resonance states investigated are obtained: (a)
   Feshbach resonances are formed by accumulation of a large amount of
   energy in either the non-dissociative bending or symmetric streching
   modes, excitations by more than five quanta are not uncommon; (b) there
   are several resonance states with low and medium bending excitation, the
   latter are different from the states observed somewhat below
   dissociation by the same triple-resonance technique; (c) several types
   of dissociation bahavior can be identified, varying greatly among the
   states; (d) several pairs of J = 0 and J = 1 Feshbach resonance states
   can be identified which differ by rigid-rotor type energies; and (e) the
   lifetimes of the assigned J = 1 rovibrational Feshbach resonances are
   considerably longer than the lifetimes of their J = 0 vibrational
   counterparts.}},

Here we report the results of spectral measurements of water vapor absorption at ambient temperature and pressure from 325 nm to 420 nm, covering most tropospherically relevant short wavelengths. Spectra were recorded using a broadband optical cavity in the chemically controlled environment of an atmospheric simulation chamber. No absorption attributable to the water monomer (or the dimer) was observed at the 0.5 nm resolution of our system. Our results are consistent with calculated spectra and recent \{DOAS\} field observations, but contradict a report of significant water absorption in the near-UV. Based on the detection limit of our instrument, we report upper limits for the water absorption cross section of less than 5Ã—10âˆ’26 cm2 moleculeâˆ’1 at our instrument resolution. For a typical, indicative slant column density of 4Ã—1023 cm2, we calculate a maximum optical depth of 0.02 arising from absorption of water vapor in the atmosphere at wavelengths between 340 nm and 420 nm, with slightly higher maximum optical depths below 340 nm. The results of this work, together with recent atmospheric observations and computational results, suggest that water vapor absorption across most of the near-UV is small compared to visible and infrared wavelengths.

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{827}},
Abstract = {{Inside the H2O snowline of protoplanetary disks, water evaporates from
   the dust-grain surface into the gas phase, whereas it is frozen out onto
   the dust in the cold region beyond the snowline. H2O ice enhances the
   solid material in the cold outer part of a disk, which promotes the
   formation of gas-giant planet cores. We can regard the H2O snowline as
   the surface that divides the regions between rocky and gaseous giant
   planet formation. Thus observationally measuring the location of the H2O
   snowline is crucial for understanding the planetesimal and planet
   formation processes, and the origin of water on Earth. In this paper, we
   find candidate water lines to locate the H2O snowline through future
   high-dispersion spectroscopic observations. First, we calculate the
   chemical composition of the disk and investigate the abundance
   distributions of H2O gas and ice, and the position of the H2O snowline.
   We confirm that the abundance of H2O gas is high not only in the hot
   midplane region inside the H2O snowline but also in the hot surface
   layer of the outer disk. Second, we calculate the H2O line profiles and
   identify those H2O lines that. are promising for locating the H2O
   snowline: the identified lines are those that have small Einstein A
   coefficients and high upper state energies. The wavelengths of the
   candidate H2O lines range from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter, and they
   overlap with the regions accessible to the Atacama Large
   Millimeter/submillimeter Array and future mid-infrared high-dispersion
   spectrographs (e.g., TMT/MICHI, SPICA).}},

   allowed vibration-rotation transitions between these eigenstates. In
   our most complete test calculations we constructed a list of 3 billion
   (3 x 10(9)) lines. At room temperature, the computed monochromatic
   absorption coefficient is in good overall agreement with the HITRAN
   data base, while at higher temperatures its value exceeds the
   HITRAN-based absorption coefficient by more than an order of magnitude,
   due to the lack of high excitation lines in HITRAN. The agreement with
   the HITEMP version of HITRAN is considerably better than with the
   standard HITRAN. By comparing stellar model atmospheric structures and
   synthetic spectra based on our most extensive line list with results
   from calculations excluding the huge number of ultra-weak lines, we
   conclude that when the lines are well chosen, a few times 10 million
   lines are more than sufficient for all astrophysical purposes. We
   therefore offer to the community a line list of 100 million lines,
   easily accessible by anonymous ftp. Finally, we have compared results
   of synthetic stellar spectra based on this line list with observed ISO
   spectra and have found good agreement. In particular in the 2-4 mum
   region around the strong fundamental bands, the agreement with
   observations is considerably better than that obtained with other

pages= {535--555},
abstract= {The water vapour continuum is characterised by absorption that varies smoothly with wavelength, from the visible to the microwave. It is present within the rotational and vibrational--rotational bands of water vapour, which consist of large numbers of narrow spectral lines, and in the many `windows' between these bands. The continuum absorption in the window regions is of particular importance for the Earth's radiation budget and for remote-sensing techniques that exploit these windows. Historically, most attention has focused on the 8--12Â $\mu$m (mid-infrared) atmospheric window, where the continuum is relatively well-characterised, but there have been many fewer measurements within bands and in other window regions. In addition, the causes of the continuum remain a subject of controversy. This paper provides a brief historical overview of the development of understanding of the continuum and then reviews recent developments, with a focus on the near-infrared spectral region. Recent laboratory measurements in near-infrared windows, which reveal absorption typically an order of magnitude stronger than in widely used continuum models, are shown to have important consequences for remote-sensing techniques that use these windows for retrieving cloud properties.},

   samples over the pressure range 150-800 Pa with the frequency-stabilized
   cavity ring-down spectroscopy technique. In order to optimize
   measurement accuracy, we integrated mK-level temperature control and
   SI-traceable pressure measurements into our cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy measurements. This technique yielded relative uncertainties
   of 0.04\% and 0.20\% in sample density and measured line intensity,
   respectively. We also referenced our spectrum frequency axes to a Cs
   clock, which provided vacuum line positions with a combined standard
   uncertainty of 3 MHz. Comparison of our measured intensities, positions
   and self-broadening parameters with literature values reveals that the
   present work substantially reduces uncertainty in these line parameters.
   For the (1,0,1)-(0,0,0) vibrational band, the measured line intensities
   agree at the 1\%-level with published ab initio calculations. Our
   spectra exhibited signal-to-noise ratios up to, approximate to 20,000:1

   quality of fit that is commensurate with the high spectrum
   signal-to-noise ratio, and unlike most other profiles considered here,
   reproduces the measured line shapes without systematic residuals over
   the entire pressure range. Our results confirm that mechanisms of (1)
   collisional narrowing, (2) speed-dependent effects and (3) partial
   correlation between velocity-changing and dephasing collisions,
   contribute to the self-broadened line shape of isolated water vapor
