  abstract = {Pure rotational transitions of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in its ground
	and first excited vibrational states have been recorded at room temperature.
	The spectrum comprises an average of 1020 scans at 0.005 {cm$^{-1}$} resolution
	recorded in the region 45-360 {cm$^{-1}$} (1.4 to 10.5 THz) with a globar
	continuum source using a Fourier transform spectrometer located at
	the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. Over 2400 rotational
	lines have been detected belonging to ground vibrational state transitions
	of the four isotopologues (H2S)-S-32, (H2S)-S-33, (H2S)-S-34, and
	(H2S)-S-36 observed in natural abundance. 65\% of these lines are
	recorded and assigned for the first time, sampling levels as high
	as J=26 and K-a=17 for (H2S)-S-32. 320 pure rotational transitions
	of (H2S)-S-32 in its first excited bending vibrational state are
	recorded and analysed for the first time and 86 transitions for (H2S)-S-34,
	where some of these transitions belong to new experimental energy
	levels. Rotational constants have been fitted for all the isotopologues
	in both vibrational states using a standard effective Hamiltonian
	approach. Comprehensive comparisons are made with previously available
	data as well as the data available in HITRAN, CDMS, and JPL databases.
	The 91 transitions assigned to (H2S)-S-36 give the first proper characterization
	of its pure rotational spectrum. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract ={This work presents the AYT2 line list: a comprehensive list of 115 million 1H232S vibration–rotation transitions computed using an empirically adjusted potential energy surface and an ab initio dipole moment surface. The line list gives complete coverage up to 11 000 cm-1 (wavelengths longer than 0.91 um) for temperatures up to 2000 K. Room temperature spectra can be simulated up to 20 000 cm-1 (0.5 um) but the predictions at visible wavelengths are less reliable. AYT2 is made available in electronic form as supplementary data to this paper at www.exomol.com.},
