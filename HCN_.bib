  abstract = {A revised rotation-vibration line list for the combined hydrogen cyanide
	(HCN)/hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) system is presented. The line list
	uses ab initio transition intensities calculated previously and extensive
	data sets of recently measured experimental energy levels. The resulting
	line list has significantly more accurate wavelengths than previous
	ones for these systems. An improved value for the separation between
	HCN and HNC is adopted, leading to an approximately 25 per cent lower
	predicted thermal population of HNC as a function of temperature
	in the key 2000 to 3000 K region. Temperature-dependent partition
	functions and equilibrium constants are presented. The line lists
	are validated by comparison with laboratory spectra and are presented
	in full as supplementary data to the article and at www.exomol.com.},
