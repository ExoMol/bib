abstract ={Nitric acid is a possible biomarker in the atmospheres of exoplanets. An accurate line list of rotational and rotationalûvibrational transitions is computed for nitric acid (HNO3). This line list covers wavelengths longer than 1.42 um (0û7000 cm-1) and temperatures up to 500 K. The line list is computed using a hybrid variational û perturbation theory and empirically tuned potential energy and dipole surfaces. It comprises almost seven billion transitions involving rotations up to J = 100. Comparisons with spectra from the HITRAN and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory data bases demonstrate the accuracy of our calculations. Synthetic spectra of waterûnitric acid mixtures suggest that nitric acid has features at 7.5 and 11.25
um that are capable of providing a clear signature for HNO3; the feature at 11.25 um is particularly promising. Partition functions plus full line lists of transitions are made available in an electronic form as supplementary data to the article and at www.exomol.com.},

Abstract = {Rotation-vibration spectra of the nitric acid molecule, HNO3(,) are
   calculated for wavenumbers up to 7000 cm(-1). Calculations are performed
   using a Hamiltonian expressed in internal curvilinear vibrational
   coordinates employing a hybrid variational-perturbation method. An
   initial potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment function (DMF)
   are calculated ab initio at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory.
   Parameters of the PES and DMF are varied to minimize differences between
   the calculated and experimental transition frequencies and intensities.
   The average, absolute deviation between calculated and experimental
   values is 0.2 cm(-1) for frequencies in the fundamental bands and 0.4
   cm(-1) for those in the first overtone and lowest combination bands. For
   the intensities, the calculated and experimental values differ by 0.3\%
   and 40\% for the fundamentals and overtones, respectively. The optimized
   PES and DMF are used to calculate the room-temperature ro-vibrational
   spectrum. These calculation reproduce both the form of the absorption
   bands and fine details of the observed spectra, including the rotational
   structure of the vibrational bands and the numerous hot absorption band.
   Many of these hot bands are found to be missing from the compilation in
   HITRAN. A room temperature line list comprising 2 x 10(9) lines is
   computed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},
