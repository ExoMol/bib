  abstract = {Using complete active space self-consistent field electronic wavefunctions
	the three-dimensional potential energy and electric dipole functions
	for the lowest two singlet and triplet states of HNS have been generated
	and used for the evaluation of the spectroscopic constants, anharmonic
	frequencies and radiative transition probabilities. The electronic
	excitation energies have been calculated by a multi-reference configuration
	interaction approach.},
