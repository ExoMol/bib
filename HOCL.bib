Abstract = {A global, ab initio potential energy surface for HOCl {[}K.A. Peterson,
   S. Skokov, J.M. Bowman, J. Chem. Phys. (in press)] is corrected to
   exactly reproduce experimental vibrational energies for 22 known bound
   states, and rotational constants for 9 low-energy states. The ab initio
   potential is first `morphed' by means of coordinate scaling to
   substantially improve its accuracy. Then a small correction potential is
   determined by the inverse perturbation theory via the singular value
   decomposition method {[}Q. Wu, J.Z.H. Zhang, Chem. Phys. Lett. 252
   (1996) 195]. The correction potential expanded in the truncated basis
   set of distributed gaussian functions, is an analytical function of the
   coordinates, and yields results that are within 0.14 cm(-1) of the
   experimental energies.},
