Title = {{The rotational spectrum and dynamical structure of LiOH and LiOD: A
   combined laboratory and ab initio study}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {11715-11730},
Abstract = {{Millimeter wave rotational spectroscopy and ab initio calculations are
   used to explore the potential energy surface of LiOH and LiOD with
   particular emphasis on the bending states and bending potential. New
   measurements extend the observed rotational lines to J=7<--6 for LiOH
   and J=8<--7 for LiOD for all bending vibrational states up to (03(3)0).
   Rotation-vibration energy levels, geometric expectation values, and
   dipole moments are calculated using extensive high-level ab initio
   three-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. Agreement
   between calculation and experiment is superb, with predicted B-v values
   typically within 0.3\%, D values within 0.2\%, q(l) values within 0.7\%,
   and dipole moments within 0.9\% of experiment. Shifts in B-v values with
   vibration and isotopic substitution are also well predicted. A combined
   theoretical and experimental structural analysis establishes the linear
   equilibrium structure with r(e)(Li-O)=1.5776(4) A and r(e)(O-H)=0.949(2)
   A. Predicted fundamental vibrational frequencies are v(1)=923.2,
   v(2)=318.3, and v(3)=3829.8 cm(-1) for LiOH and v(1)=912.9, v(2)=245.8,
   and v(3)=2824.2 cm(-1) for LiOD. The molecule is extremely nonrigid with
   respect to angular deformation; the calculated deviation from linearity
   for the vibrationally averaged structure is 19.0degrees in the (000)
   state and 41.9degrees in the (03(3)0) state. The calculation not only
   predicts, in agreement with previous work {[}P. R. Bunker, P. Jensen, A.
   Karpfen, and H. Lischka, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 135, 89 (1989)], a change
   from a linear to a bent minimum energy configuration at elongated Li-O
   distances, but also a similar change from linear to bent at elongated
   O-H distances. }},

Pages = {{385-392}},
Abstract = {{RCCSD(T) calculations combined with large basis sets are employed to
   obtain the heats of formation of LiOH and LiOH+; in addition, the first
   adiabatic and vertical ionization energies of LiOH are obtained. Our
   best values are: DeltaH(f)(LiOH, 0 K) = -57.0+/--0.5 kcal mol(-1) and
   D-0 = 104+/-1 kcal mol(-1). The ground state of LiOH+ is a quasi-linear
   Renner-Tefler X(2)Pi state and AIE(LiOH) = 8.91+/-0.03 eV.
   DeltaH(f)(LiOH+, 0 K) = 148+/-2 kcal mol(-1) and D-0 = 23+/-1 kcal
   mol(-1). The proton affinity of LiO(X(2)Pi) is derived as 230+/-1 kcal

   ANALYSIS}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {313-319},
Abstract = {{Some 29 microwave transitions in the millimeter region have been
   measured in the high-temperature vapor of LiOH, ranging up to J = 5,
   including lines from the isotopomers Li-7 16OH, Li-7 16OD in both ground
   and excited bending states, and Li-7 18OH in the vibrational ground
   state only.  An analysis of these transitions, together with nine
   previously known radio-frequency transitions, based on the semirigid
   bender model of vibration-rotation interaction has been used to
   investigate the form of the bending potential and to measure the
   semirigidity parameters that show the variation in the bond lengths that
   accompany the large-amplitude bending motion.  The molecule was found to
   be linear in its equilibrium configuration, with an essentially harmonic
   bending potential.  The experimentally derived quadratic semirigidity
   parameter for the Li-O bond was found to agree to within less than 5\%
   with that from an ab initio calculation at the MP3/6-311G{*}{*} level.}},
