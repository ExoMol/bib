abstract = {Approaches related to graph theory are investigated which allow a better understanding and yield routes for systematic enlargement and improvement of experimental spectroscopic line lists of molecules. The proposed protocols are based on the fact that quantum mechanics builds, in a simple and natural way, large-scale, weighted, undirected graphs, whereby the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. A small part of molecular quantum mechanical graphs can be probed experimentally via high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, while the complete graph encompassing the full line list information for a given molecule can be obtained through sophisticated variational nuclear motion computations. Both approaches yield what one may call spectroscopic networks (SNs). It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule that both the measured and the computed one-photon absorption SNs have a scale-free behavior with all of the usual consequences, including appearance of hubs, robustness, error tolerance, and the “small-world” property. For the complete computed “deterministic” network the scale-free property holds if a realistic intensity cut-off is employed during its build-up, thus introducing “stochasticity”. The graph-theoretical view of molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of the information systems containing high-resolution spectroscopic data. }

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are "deterministic" by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness ("stochasticity") is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. }

Title = {THE USE OF TERM-VALUE FITS IN TESTING SPECTROSCOPIC ASSIGNMENTS},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {283-290},
Abstract = {{The use of a least-squares term-value fit of a spectrum as a means of
   testing assignments is described. In a direct term-value fit the normal
   matrix is singular, with one zero eigenvalue for each set of connected
   levels. These equations are solved by a method which gives the term
   values of each connected set relative to their mean. The standard
   deviation sigma from a term-value fit should be equal to the measurement
   error. It is shown that, as a test of individual assignments, it is
   possible to calculate from the results of a fit the fractional change
   tau(l) = (sigma(l) - sigma)/sigma when each line l is omitted singly
   from the fit. Anomalously large negative values of tau(l) indicate lines
   that may be misassigned or mismeasured. As an example, it is shown that
   the standard deviation of an unweighted term-value fit of a published
   compilation of 294 lines of the H-3+ ion can be reduced from 0.031 cm-1
   to 0.004 cm-1 by the omission of 7 lines. }},
