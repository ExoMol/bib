Abstract = {The dicarbon (C-2 ) molecule is an important molecu-lar species observed
   in many carbon-containing gaseous environments. The spectroscopic and
   dissociative studies of C-2 have attracted great attention for a long
   time for understanding its electronic characters as well as the
   evolution and cycling of carbon in the universe. In this study, the
   lifetimes of C-2 populated at the three high-lying electronic states of
   (2-4)(3)Delta(g) in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region have been
   experimentally measured using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer and the
   VUV-pump-UV-probe photoionization scheme. The measurements showed that
   all the rovibronic levels in the 2(g)(3)Delta(g) state exhibit shorter
   lifetimes than the dynamical limit of the experimental method,
   consistent with the theoretically predicted radiative lifetimes.
   Dependence of the lifetime on the vibrational level was observed in the
   3(3)Delta(g) state, and a marginal rotational dependence was noticed in
   the v `=1 vibrational level. For the 4(3)Delta(g) state, the
   rotationally resolved lifetimes in the v(y)=1 vibrational level were
   found to be slightly longer than those in the v `=0 and 2 vibrational
   levels. Such a complicated dependence of the lifetime on the rovibronic
   level makes further experimental and theoretical investigations highly
   desired for understanding the dynamics in the high-lying excited states
   of C-2 .},

Abstract = {Spectroscopic study of C2, an important homonuclear diatomic molecule,
   has attracted considerable attention over the past 200 years owing to
   its significant applications in both the comprehension of chemical bond
   theory and astronomical observation. Despite substantial achievements in
   experimental and theoretical identifications of the low-lying electronic
   transitions of C2 in the UV, visible and infrared regions, originating
   either from its ground singlet X1 Sigma+g or triplet a3 Pi u state,
   further spectroscopic investigation in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   region is essential, particularly for identifying its high-lying excited
   states in the energy region from its dissociation to ionization
   threshold. In this study, we reported the identification of a new
   high-lying excited state of C2 originating from the a3 Pi u state
   through the 1VUV + 1 ` UV resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
   scheme. A total of 13 absorption bands of type 3 Delta g-3 Pi u in the
   VUV photon energy range of 75 500-82 400 cm-1 were observed, and the
   upper electronic state was identified as 43 Delta g of C2. The term
   value was determined to be 83 135.1 cm-1, indicating the highest
   experimentally identified electronic state of C2 thus far. The
   spectroscopic parameters were accurately determined, implying that the
   43 Delta g state might be a valence state instead of a Rydberg-type
   electronic state. The current spectroscopic study should guide future
   theoretical investigations on the high-lying electronic structure of C2.},

   in the last two centuries, the radiative and photodissociative
   properties of C2 in its highly excited electronic states are still
   largely unexplored, particularly in the short vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   region. In this study, the lifetimes of C2 for rotational levels in the
   recently identified 13 Sigma g + state up to the vibrational level nu `
   = 4 and in the f 3 Sigma g - state up to nu ` = 2 are measured for the
   first time with a VUV-pump-UV-probe photoionization scheme. It is found
   that all rovibrational levels in the f 3 Sigma g - state have lifetimes
   shorter than the dynamical limit of similar to 4.7 ns of the present
   method, and the lifetimes in the 13 Sigma g + state show obvious and
   complex dependence on the rotational and vibrational quantum levels.
   Generally, the lifetime in the 13 Sigma g + state becomes shorter at
   higher rotational and vibrational levels, i.e., the longest lifetime
   measured in the nu ` = 0 level is similar to 18 ns, while all rotational
   levels in the nu ` = 4 level are found to have shorter lifetimes than
   similar to 4.7 ns. This implies that predissociation might occur and
   become more prominent at the higher energy levels in the 13 Sigma g +
   state. The prominent dependence of the lifetime on the rotational,
   vibrational and electronic level indicates complex dynamical processes
   in the highly excited states of C2.},

Abstract = {As one of the most important diatomic molecules in the universe, the
   spectroscopic characterizations of C-2 have attracted wide attention in
   various fields, such as interstellar chemistry, planetary atmospheric
   chemistry, and combustion. In recent years, a systematic spectroscopic
   study of C-2 in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region has been carried out
   in our laboratory by using the (1VUV+1 ` UV) resonance-enhanced
   multiphoton ionization method based on the combination of a tunable VUV
   laser source and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Two new electronic
   transition band systems have been reported, following the pioneering
   work of Herzberg and co-workers in 1969. In the current study, a total
   of 18 vibronic transition bands of C-2 from the lower a(3)Pi(u) state
   are experimentally observed in the VUV photon energy range 72000-81000
   cm(-1), and 6 new upper vibronic levels of (3)Delta(g) symmetry are
   identified, which are assigned as the v ` = 0-5 vibrational levels of
   the 3(3)Delta(g) state of C-2. The term energy T-e of the 3(3)Delta(g)
   state is determined to be in the range of 78425-78475 cm(-1)
   (9.724-9.730 eV) with respect to the ground X-1 Sigma(+)(g) state, and
   the molecular constants such as vibrational and rotational constants are
   also determined, which are in reasonable agreement with those predicted
   by high-level ab initio theoretical calculations. Irregular vibrational
   energy level spacings in the 3(3)Delta(g) state are observed, which is
   tentatively attributed to the strong perturbations between the
   3(3)Delta(g) and 2(3)Delta(g) states, as previously predicted by theory.},

Abstract = {The dicarbon radical, C-2, is one of the most abundant molecules in the
   universe, and has been widely observed in various energetic
   environments. Even though numerous experimental and theoretical
   investigations on C-2 have been done during the last two centuries,
   spectroscopic study of C-2 in vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region has been
   rare. The only three known absorption band systems in VUV region were
   identified by Herzberg and co-workers in 1969 by VUV spectrograph,
   namely the electronic transitions F-1 pi(u)(v `)-X-1 sigma(+)(g)(v `'),
   f(3)sigma(-)(g)(v `)-a(3)pi(u)(v `') and g(3)delta(g)(v `)-a(3)pi(u)(v
   `') (Herzberg-Lagerqvist-Malmberg transitions). In this study, we employ
   a two-photon resonance-enhanced four-wave mixing based VUV laser source
   and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for reinvestigating the above
   three electronic transitions of C-2 through a resonant (1VUV + 1 ` UV)
   photoionization scheme. Besides those vibronic transitions as identified
   by Herzberg and co-workers, many more absorption bands belonging to the
   electronic transitions f(3)sigma(-)(g)(v `)-a(3)pi(u)(v `') and
   g(3)delta(g)(v `)-a(3)pi(u)(v `') are observed with their spectroscopic
   parameters determined. The rather astrophysically important F1 pi u
   state is not observed here by the resonant (1VUV + 1 ` UV)
   photoionization scheme, which must be due to its fast predissociation
   process. Instead, our study shows that the vibronic band g(3)delta(g)(v
   ` = 2)-a(3)pi(u)(v `' = 0) exactly overlaps with F-1 pi(u)(v ` = 0)-X-1
   sigma(g)+(v `' = 0), which was not realized in previous studies. The
   potential implications of these findings to astronomical observations
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {{The C$_2$ Swan system (d(3)Pi(g)-a(3)Pi(u)) was observed in emission for
   the Delta v = -3 to Delta v = +2 sequences in the 14,000-24,000 cm(-1)
   spectral range using a Fourier transform spectrometer. We carried out a
   global simultaneous fit by including a wide range of vibrational states.
   A total of 34 bands with v' = 0-10 and v `' = 0-9 were rotationally
   assigned. Numerous discrepancies were found in the assignments and in
   the measured transition wavenumbers between the new measurements and
   previous results. Most of the measured transition wavenumbers and their
   assignments for relatively low-v bands agreed with published data. On
   the contrary, for high-v bands our line positions and assignments
   disagreed with the tabulated literature values. In particular, the lines
   of six bands involving the levels with v' = 4, 5, and 6 are almost
   completely different from the previous work. Major sources of the
   disagreement are thought to be line congestion and perturbations found
   in these bands. From the analysis, perturbations for v' = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,
   8, 9, and 10 in the d(3)Pi(g) state were identified. A study of these

Our profile syntheses revealed that the lines of the F-X bands were broadened as a result of a perturbation involving the upper levels. Further evidence for the perturbation came from anomalies in line strength and position for the F-X (0,0) band. The perturbation likely arises from a combination of triplet-singlet interactions involving spin-orbit mixing between (3)Pi(u) states and F (1)Pi(u) and an avoided crossing between the (3)Pi(u) states. Tunneling through a potential barrier caused by the 3 and 4 (1)Pi(u) states and spin-orbit mixing with other close-lying triplet states of ungerade symmetry are less likely. Except for the broadening, lines in the F-X (1,0) band appear free from anomalies and can be used to study interstellar C$_2$; new results for 10 sight lines are present.}}

   the C$_2$ rotational ladder to the interplay of thermal and radiative
   conditions, with low and high rotational levels tracing different
   regions of the parameter space. To relieve constraints to the formation
   and excitation of C$_2$ molecules, we propose a scenario in which the

   E(1)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2) of C2 and
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) of C2+ are investigated
   theoretically by using MRD-CI wave functions.  Due to a heavy mixing
   between bonding and antibonding configurations, the E state (with a
   maximum contribution of sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2 of 45\%) does not show
   the typical features of strongly bound states (short R(e) and high
   omega(e)).  Because of the mixing, the experimental Freymark system
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+ - A(1)PI(u) of C2 exhibits a moderate intensity though.
   At R = 2.43 bohr (an intermediate geometry between both minima), a
   calculated transition moment SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.151 au2 disagrees
   with an experimental estimate of 2.26 +/- 1.13 au2 from Cooper and
   Nicholls.  The same authors assigned to the Mulliken band D(1)SIGMA(u)+
   - X(1)SIGMA(g)+ of C2 a SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.13 +/- 0.05 au2, whereas
   this work and earlier data from the literature indicate a higher value
   of 0.41 au2 for that quantity.  A total radiative lifetime tau(0)
   almost-equal-to 15 ns for the E(1)SIGMA(g)+ state is mainly dicated by
   the radiative process E --> A, the competitive decay E --> D being
   about 10 times slower.  The 2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) state
   of C2+ is strongly bound, with a shortening DELTA-R(e) = 0.35 bohr and
   an increase DELTA-omega(e) almost-equal-to 800 cm-1 (60\%) relative to
   the X(4)SIGMA(g)- ground state.  A lifetime tau(0)(2(2)SIGMA(g)+)
   almost-equal-to 28 ns results from radiative decay into both
   1(2)SIGMA(u)+ and 2(2)PI(u) states.  On the basis of the present
   spectroscopic data for C2+, an absorption band observed at 2.77 eV
   (assumed as belonging to C2) is tentatively reassigned to the
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+ <-- 1(2)SIGMA(u)+ transition of C2+, with a calculated

abstract = {{Context. The Red Rectangle proto-planetary nebula (HD 44179) is known for a number of rather narrow emission features superimposed on a broad extended red emission (ERE) covering the 5000-7500 angstrom regime. The origin of these emission features is unknown.
Aims. The aim of the present work is to search for potential carriers by combining new observational and laboratory data. This also allows to interpret spectral emission features in terms of actual physical conditions like temperature and density constraints and to trace chemical processes in the outflows of the Red Rectangle.
Methods. Observational spectra have been obtained with the EMMI-NTT at offsets of 3 '', 6 '', 7 '', 11 '', 16 '' and 20 '' distance to the central star HD 44179. The spectra are compared to the outcome of a time-gated laser induced fluorescence laboratory study of an expanding acetylene plasma using a special supersonic pin-hole discharge source. With this set-up the hydrocarbon chemistry in the Red Rectangle nebula is simulated under laboratory controlled conditions. The plasma source has the unique feature to generate electronically and vibrationally excited species at low rotational temperatures. The comparison is facilitated by a simple model for fluorescent emission in the nebula.
Results. Two of the astronomically observed narrow emission bands can be assigned as originating from unresolved rovibronic progressions within the d(3)Pi(g) -> a(3)Pi(u) Swan system of the C$_2$ radical. The band appearance corresponds to a rotational temperature between 200 and 1000 K. The emission is driven by absorption in the C$_2$ Phillips bands followed by intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state and pumping in the Swan bands.
Conclusions. These observations imply an active (photo) chemistry in the ejecta of the Red Rectangle.}}}

Abstract = {Coupled-cluster methods including effects of triple excitations have
   been used with large basis sets to study several electronic states of
   C2, C2-, and C2+. r(e), omega(e), D(e), and T(e) have been computed for
   each state considered.  For those states for which experimental data
   are available, the errors are typically less than 0.002 angstrom, 20
   cm-1, and 0.1 eV for r(e), omega(e), and D(e), respectively.  These
   errors are comparable with the best previous results on C2 and
   significantly smaller than those for previous calculations on C2- and
   C2+.  For T(e) the results are also satisfactory and comparable with
   previous work, but some difficulties arise when one or both of the
   states have considerable multireference character.  For two states of
   C2+ not experimentally characterized, the present data should be
   sufficiently accurate to be of some assistance to experimental studies.
    The electron affinity of the ground state of C2 and the ionization
   potentials of the ground and first excited states of C2 have been
   computed, and particular attention has been given to correlation errors
   in these quantities.  It has been shown that triple excitations
   significantly decrease the electron affinity.  By neglecting or taking
   insufficient account of triple excitations, some previous calculations
   were biased towards the anion and obtained fortuitously good agreement
   with experiment.  The correlation error of the present calculations is
   such that the calculations are slightly biased towards the neutral
   molecule, but the error is only 0.2 eV.  For the ionization potentials,
   too, triple excitations play an important role.  Reasonable agreement
   with experiment has been achieved by the present calculations.
   Overall, the present study:  (1) underscores the importance of triple
   excitations; (2) shows the success of single-reference couple-cluster
   theory in calculating properties of a single state, even when that
   state has considerable multireference character; and (3) highlights the
   care which must be taken when comparing different electronic states
   with these methods when one or both states have considerable
   multireference character.},

abstract = "The origin of \{C2\} high-pressure bands observed in discharges through \{CO\} has not been cleared up. The suggestion by Little and Browne of a collisional transfer between the metastable \{C2\} (5Πg, v=0) and the radiative \{C2\} (d3Πg, v=6) level was progress. However, these authors claimed that only the combination reaction C+C+M→C2+M should be invoked for the production of the metastable level, excluding the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction that other authors believed to be at the origin of the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. The correlation diagram of the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction shows that C2(5Πg) + \{CO\} correlates with ground-state reactants while C2(d3Πg) + \{CO\} does not. Such a reaction could thus be involved in the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. A kinetic study of these bands in a fast-flow reactor, downstream from a microwave discharge through \{CO\} diluted in He, demonstrated that both reactions C + C + M and C+C2O were involved. It could be concluded that the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction has a lower branching ratio for C2(5Πg) production than C+C+M→C2+M. However, the C+C2O reaction has in most discharges, as in ours, a greater reaction rate than that of the C+C+M reaction so its contribution is not negligible and may be the main one if the dissociation rate of \{CO\} is low.

The rotational analysis shows conclusively that the molecule responsible is a diatomic molecule containing two carbon nuclei, a conclusion that is further confirmed by the observation of the corresponding system using 13CH4 instead of 12CH4. Neither the upper nor the lower state is one of the known states of C2. None of the predicted low-lying states of C2 fits the observed new states. Two possibilities remain: either the new system corresponds to two fairly highly excited levels of C2 or it is due to the C2− ion. The latter alternative finds some support in the similarity of the new system to the near ultraviolet bands of N2+ (which has the same number of electrons). However, the doublet splitting required by this interpretation has not been resolved, nor has the study of perturbations in the upper state given clear-cut evidence for doublet structure. On the other hand, a mass-spectrometric investigation of the ions in the flash discharge producing the spectrum shows a strong C2− peak, while C2+ is weak. A definitive answer to the question of the carrier of the new spectrum cannot yet be given.}}

Abstract = {{White dwarfs (WDs) with carbon absorption features in their optical
   spectra are known as DQ WDs. The subclass of peculiar DQ WDs are cool
   objects (T-eff less than or similar to 6000 K) that show molecular
   absorption bands that have centroid wavelengths similar to 100-300
   angstrom shortward of the bandheads of the C$_2$ Swan bands. These
   ``peculiar DQ bands'' have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such as C2H.
   We point out that C2H does not show strong absorption bands with
   wavelengths matching those of the peculiar DQ bands, and neither does
   any other simple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool WD
   atmosphere. C$_2$ seems to be the only reasonable candidate for producing
   the peculiar DQ bands. Many characteristics of those bands can be
   understood if they are pressure-shifted Swan bands. While current models
   of WD atmospheres suggest that, in general, peculiar DQ WDs do not have
   higher photospheric pressures than normal DQ WDs do, that finding
   requires confirmation by improved models of WD atmospheres and of the
   behavior of C$_2$ at high pressures and temperatures. If it is eventually
   shown that the peculiar DQ bands cannot be explained as pressure shifted
   Swan bands, the only explanation remaining would seem to be that they
   arise from highly rotationally excited C$_2$ (J(peak) greater than or
   similar to 45). In either case, the absorption band profiles can in
   principle be used to constrain the pressure and the rotational
   temperature of C$_2$ in the line-forming regions of normal and peculiar DQ
   WD atmospheres, which will be useful for comparison with models.
   Finally, we note that progress in understanding magnetic DQ WDs may
   require models that simultaneously consider magnetic fields, high
   pressures, and rotational excitation of C$_2$.}},

   several hundred parsecs of very low density n approximate to 10 cm(-3).

   the predictions of an X-ray induced chemistry driven by an ionisation

   temperatures of T = 25-50 K agree with temperatures inferred from C$_2$.

   denity of 2 x 10(12) cm(-2) towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 and H2O+ absorption

   accurate than the Hartree-Fock wave function and easier to interpret

   characterizing the bonding in C$_2$. The GVB calculations show that the
   electronic wave function of C2 is not well described by a product of
   singlet-coupled, shared electron pairs (perfect pairing), which is the
   theoretical basis for covalent chemical bonds. Rather, C$_2$ is best
   described as having a traditional covalent a bond with the electrons in
   the remaining orbitals of the two carbon atoms antiferromagnetically
   coupled. However, even this description is incomplete as the perfect
   pairing spin function also makes a significant contribution to the full

Abstract = {{The diatomic carbon molecule has a complex electronic structure with a

   (X-1 Sigma(+)(g), A(1)Pi(u), B-1 Delta(g), and B'(1)Sigma(+)(g)) were
   obtained by high-level ab initio calculations. Valence electron
   correlation was accounted for by the correlation energy extrapolation by
   intrinsic scaling (CEEIS) method. Additional corrections to the PECs
   included core-valence correlation and relativistic effects. Spin-orbit
   corrections were found to be insignificant. The impact of using
   dynamically weighted reference wave functions in conjunction with CEEIS
   was examined and found to give indistinguishable results from the even
   weighted method. The PECs showed multiple curve crossings due to the B-1
   Delta(g) state as well as an avoided crossing between the two
   (1)Sigma(+)(g) states. Vibrational energy levels were computed for each
   of the four electronic states, as well as rotational constants and

   bond distances are reproduced to within 0.05 \%. The dissociation

   kcal/mol, achieving ``chemical accuracy.{''} Vibrational energy levels

   of 2.41 cm(-1). Calculated rotational constants exhibit very good

Title = {The origin of peculiar molecular bands in cool {DQ} white dwarfs},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{519}},
Abstract = {{Aims. The DQ white dwarfs are stars whose atmosphere is enriched with
   carbon, which for cool stars (T(eff) < 8000 K) is indicated by the Swan
   bands of C(2) in the optical part of their spectra. With decreasing
   effective temperature these molecular bands undergo a significant
   blueshift (similar to 100-300 angstrom). The origin of this phenomenon
   has been disputed over the last two decades and has remained unknown. We
   attempt to address this problem by investigating the impact of dense
   helium on the spectroscopic properties of molecular carbon, the
   electronic Swan band transition energy T(e) and the vibrational
   frequency omega(e), under the physical conditions encountered inside
   helium-rich, fluid-like atmospheres of cool DQ white dwarfs.
   Methods. In our investigation we use a density functional theory based
   quantum mechanical approach.
   Results. The electronic transition energy T(e) increases monotonically
   with the helium density (Delta T(e) (eV) similar to 1.6 rho (g/cm(3))).
   This causes the Swan absorption to occur at shorter wavelengths compared
   with unperturbed C(2). On the other hand the pressure-induced increase
   in the vibrational frequency is insufficient to account for the observed
   Swan bands shifts. Our findings are in line with the shape of the
   distorted molecular bands observed in DQp stars, but the predicted
   photospheric density required to reproduce these spectral features is
   one order of magnitude lower than the one predicted by the current
   models. This indicates pollution by hydrogen or reflects incomplete
   knowledge of the properties of fluid-like atmospheres of these stars.
   Conclusions. Our work shows that at the physical conditions encountered
   in the fluid-like atmospheres of cool DQ white dwarfs the strong
   interactions between C(2) and helium atoms cause an increase in T(e),
   which should produce a blueward shift of the Swan bands. This is
   consistent with the observations and indicates that the observed
   Swan-like molecular bands are most likely the pressure-shifted bands of
   C(2).}},

Measurements using a picosecond laser system in conjunction with a streak camera allowed determination of typical fluorescence lifetimes of levels in the d state and of population changes introduced by rotational energy transfer (RET) and by state-dependent quenching. Excitation−emission spectroscopy yielded two-dimensional maps containing all excitation and all emission spectra in the spectral ranges between 19 340 and 20 150 cm-1 (excitation) and from 546 to 573 nm (emission) and allowed unambiguous assignment of all transitions in this spectral region. Our measurements show a comparatively long quenching lifetime (around 2 ns) and dominant effects of energy transfer on shape and intensity of the acquired spectra (90\% of the fluorescence stems from levels populated by ET). A pronounced dependence of the total RET on the quantum number of the initially excited state is observed. Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is significantly weaker (only 5\% contribution for excitation in the v‘ = 1 level). Implications for quantitative concentration measurements are discussed, and exemplary spatially resolved profiles in a well-characterized low-pressure propene flame are presented. }

Abstract = {{We have observed laser-induced fluorescence of two different band
   systems of C$_2$ in a flame, excited by a tunable KrF laser near 248 nm.
   The first comprises several P and R lines of the (1,0) band of the e
   (3)Pi(g) - a (3)Pi(u), Fox-Herzberg system, with fluorescence bands
   extending past 350 nm. The second is the band head region of the (7,1)
   band of the D (1)Sigma(u)(+) <-- B' (1)Sigma(g)(+) system, with
   fluorescence at 232 nm from D to the X (1)Sigma(g)(+) ground state.
   Neither band has been previously observed in any environment. The flame
   in these experiments is highly sooting, and the C$_2$ seen here is likely
   produced by laser vaporization of the soot with subsequent laser
   photolysis of a C$_2$ precursor. In a rich flame, this fluorescence could
   cause interferences in other studies such as KrF laser Raman scattering.
   Moreover, signal level calculations suggest native C$_2$ near 10 ppm could
   be readily observed using the Fox-Herzberg excitation. Raman
   measurements of major species (X greater than or equal to 0.01)in the
   same flame, using the KrF laser, are in good agreement with a model

Abstract = {{We report on observations and analysis of the C$_2$ Swan band Delta nu = 0
   sequence in the optical spectrum of Comet Hale-Bopp, One set of
   observational data was obtained when this comet was at a large
   heliocentric distance (3.03 AU), This unusual distance provided the
   opportunity to enhance our knowledge of the intercombination transitions
   in C$_2$.
   These transitions are forbidden for electric dipole radiation, but they
   exist due to higher order multipole radiation. Although the transition
   probabilities are several orders of magnitude smaller than allowed
   electronic transitions, the intercombination bands play a key role in
   the fluorescence process of the C$_2$ radical. This role is to provide a
   cooling path for rotational and vibrational populations seen in the
   visible spectrum, Because their exact transition probability is not yet
   completely clear better quantitative knowledge of these transitions can
   help constrain C$_2$ quantities in comets.
   To analyze the data, an equilibrium fluorescence model with 5652
   different vibrational levels was created. This model included the
   triplet and singlet systems of C$_2$ involved in the fluorescence process.
   Theoretical spectra corresponding to different values of the electronic
   transition moments for the a(3)Pi(u)-X(1)Sigma(g)(+) and
   c(3)Sigma(u)(+)- X-1 Sigma(g)(+) transitions were computed. These

From the simultaneous measurement of the Mulliken (X1Σ+g–D1Σ+u) and Freymark (A1Πu–E1Σ+g) systems, the nascent population ratio of C2 (A1Πu) to C2 (X1Σ+g) molecules was determined.

This permits a slight improvement in the accuracy of some of the fine structure constants. A variety of lineshapes are observed for the various branches by magnetic rotation. Because the b3Σg− fine structure is small, giving a partial overlap, the peak frequency of a magnetic rotation signal usually does not correspond to the center frequency of the normal absorption signal of that transition.

   I], CI, CH vibration-rotation, C(2) Swan) is log epsilon(C) = 8.39 +/-
   0.05, including our best estimate of possible systematic errors.
   Consistent results also come from the CH electronic lines, which we have
   relegated to a supporting role due to their sensitivity to the line
   broadening. The new 3D based solar C abundance is significantly lower
   than previously estimated in studies using 1D model atmospheres.}},

Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we report the first attempt to detect directly the
   intercombination transition lines of the C$_2$ molecule in a comet.
   Indeed, these transitions play a key role in the C$_2$ fluorescence
   process but had never been observed directly so far. We conducted an
   observational program with the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory 4
   m telescope, located in Chile, on September 15(th) and 16(th), 1997. The
   spectral range covered was 1.99 - 2.15 mu m, in order to detect the
   emission lines of the X(1)Sigma(g)(+)-a(3)II(u) (3,0) band, that should
   be degraded to the blue with a bandhead located at 2.127 mu m. This band
   was chosen because of its expected brightness and its wavelength,
   corresponding to a good atmospheric transmission and a relatively low
   sky background. In this paper we present the theoretical calculation
   allowing to model the expected spectrum and the results obtained with
   our observational data. These results, unfortunately, cannot allow the
   detection of the expected emission lines. This is due to a too strong
   noise, generated by the sky background emission lines, that cannot be
   totally removed from the spectrum.}}}

Abstract = {{Ab initio methods are used to compute photodissociation and radiative

To this end, self-consistent-field + configuration interaction
wavefunctions and potential energy curves of the X'X; and the first
four 'II, states and transition moments between the ground and excited
electronic states are computed. Photodissociation cross sections for
absorption into the second and third 'II, states are calculated and
the corresponding interstellar photodissociation probability is found
to be 0.73 x 10-'os-'.  Ground-state transition probabilities and
absorption oscillator strengths foo of the Phillips (A 'II,-X 'Xi) and
2 'II,-X 'Xi systems are determined.}}}
