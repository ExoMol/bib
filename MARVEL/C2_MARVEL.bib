Abstract = {{The C$_2$ Swan system (d(3)Pi(g)-a(3)Pi(u)) was observed in emission for

   spectral range using a Fourier transform spectrometer. We carried out a
   global simultaneous fit by including a wide range of vibrational states.
   A total of 34 bands with v' = 0-10 and v `' = 0-9 were rotationally
   assigned. Numerous discrepancies were found in the assignments and in
   the measured transition wavenumbers between the new measurements and
   previous results. Most of the measured transition wavenumbers and their
   assignments for relatively low-v bands agreed with published data. On
   the contrary, for high-v bands our line positions and assignments
   disagreed with the tabulated literature values. In particular, the lines
   of six bands involving the levels with v' = 4, 5, and 6 are almost
   completely different from the previous work. Major sources of the
   disagreement are thought to be line congestion and perturbations found
   in these bands. From the analysis, perturbations for v' = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,
   8, 9, and 10 in the d(3)Pi(g) state were identified. A study of these
   rotational perturbations suggest that some of them are likely caused by

Absorption from the electronic transitions, D (1)Sigma(+)(u) - X (1)Sigma(+)(g) (0,0) as well as F (1)Pi(u) - X (1)Sigma(+)(g) (0,0) and (1,0), was the focus of the study. Our profile syntheses revealed that the lines of the F-X bands were broadened as a result of a perturbation involving the upper levels. Further evidence for the perturbation came from anomalies in line strength and position for the F-X (0,0) band. The perturbation likely arises from a combination of triplet-singlet interactions involving spin-orbit mixing between (3)Pi(u) states and F (1)Pi(u) and an avoided crossing between the (3)Pi(u) states. Tunneling through a potential barrier caused by the 3 and 4 (1)Pi(u) states and spin-orbit mixing with other close-lying triplet states of ungerade symmetry are less likely. Except for the broadening, lines in the F-X (1,0) band appear free from anomalies and can be used to study interstellar C$_2$; new results for 10 sight lines are present.}}

   carbon molecule. The present results suggest that diffuse and
   translucent interstellar clouds may present a structure in which regions
   with different densities and kinetic temperatures overlap along the line
   of sight, such as core-halo clouds, the nested structure of the
   molecular gas, and clumpiness. Such conclusion reflects the response of
   the C$_2$ rotational ladder to the interplay of thermal and radiative
   conditions, with low and high rotational levels tracing different
   regions of the parameter space. To relieve constraints to the formation
   and excitation of C$_2$ molecules, we propose a scenario in which the
   chemistry in diffuse clouds is supplemented by chemistry in many
   transient and tiny perturbations.}},

Journal = JPC,
Year = {1992},

Abstract = {The radiative properties of the doubly-excited states
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2) of C2 and
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) of C2+ are investigated
   theoretically by using MRD-CI wave functions.  Due to a heavy mixing
   between bonding and antibonding configurations, the E state (with a
   maximum contribution of sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2 of 45\%) does not show
   the typical features of strongly bound states (short R(e) and high
   omega(e)).  Because of the mixing, the experimental Freymark system
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+ - A(1)PI(u) of C2 exhibits a moderate intensity though.
   At R = 2.43 bohr (an intermediate geometry between both minima), a
   calculated transition moment SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.151 au2 disagrees
   with an experimental estimate of 2.26 +/- 1.13 au2 from Cooper and
   Nicholls.  The same authors assigned to the Mulliken band D(1)SIGMA(u)+
   - X(1)SIGMA(g)+ of C2 a SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.13 +/- 0.05 au2, whereas
   this work and earlier data from the literature indicate a higher value
   of 0.41 au2 for that quantity.  A total radiative lifetime tau(0)
   almost-equal-to 15 ns for the E(1)SIGMA(g)+ state is mainly dicated by
   the radiative process E --> A, the competitive decay E --> D being
   about 10 times slower.  The 2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) state
   of C2+ is strongly bound, with a shortening DELTA-R(e) = 0.35 bohr and
   an increase DELTA-omega(e) almost-equal-to 800 cm-1 (60\%) relative to
   the X(4)SIGMA(g)- ground state.  A lifetime tau(0)(2(2)SIGMA(g)+)
   almost-equal-to 28 ns results from radiative decay into both
   1(2)SIGMA(u)+ and 2(2)PI(u) states.  On the basis of the present
   spectroscopic data for C2+, an absorption band observed at 2.77 eV
   (assumed as belonging to C2) is tentatively reassigned to the
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+ <-- 1(2)SIGMA(u)+ transition of C2+, with a calculated
   DELTA-E00 = 2.81 eV.},

abstract = {{Context. The Red Rectangle proto-planetary nebula (HD 44179) is known for a number of rather narrow emission features superimposed on a broad extended red emission (ERE) covering the 5000-7500 angstrom regime. The origin of these emission features is unknown.
Aims. The aim of the present work is to search for potential carriers by combining new observational and laboratory data. This also allows to interpret spectral emission features in terms of actual physical conditions like temperature and density constraints and to trace chemical processes in the outflows of the Red Rectangle.
Methods. Observational spectra have been obtained with the EMMI-NTT at offsets of 3 '', 6 '', 7 '', 11 '', 16 '' and 20 '' distance to the central star HD 44179. The spectra are compared to the outcome of a time-gated laser induced fluorescence laboratory study of an expanding acetylene plasma using a special supersonic pin-hole discharge source. With this set-up the hydrocarbon chemistry in the Red Rectangle nebula is simulated under laboratory controlled conditions. The plasma source has the unique feature to generate electronically and vibrationally excited species at low rotational temperatures. The comparison is facilitated by a simple model for fluorescent emission in the nebula.
Results. Two of the astronomically observed narrow emission bands can be assigned as originating from unresolved rovibronic progressions within the d(3)Pi(g) -> a(3)Pi(u) Swan system of the C$_2$ radical. The band appearance corresponds to a rotational temperature between 200 and 1000 K. The emission is driven by absorption in the C$_2$ Phillips bands followed by intersystem crossing from the singlet to the triplet state and pumping in the Swan bands.
Conclusions. These observations imply an active (photo) chemistry in the ejecta of the Red Rectangle.}}}

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1992},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {6073-6084},
Abstract = {Coupled-cluster methods including effects of triple excitations have
   been used with large basis sets to study several electronic states of
   C2, C2-, and C2+. r(e), omega(e), D(e), and T(e) have been computed for
   each state considered.  For those states for which experimental data
   are available, the errors are typically less than 0.002 angstrom, 20
   cm-1, and 0.1 eV for r(e), omega(e), and D(e), respectively.  These
   errors are comparable with the best previous results on C2 and
   significantly smaller than those for previous calculations on C2- and
   C2+.  For T(e) the results are also satisfactory and comparable with
   previous work, but some difficulties arise when one or both of the
   states have considerable multireference character.  For two states of
   C2+ not experimentally characterized, the present data should be
   sufficiently accurate to be of some assistance to experimental studies.
    The electron affinity of the ground state of C2 and the ionization
   potentials of the ground and first excited states of C2 have been
   computed, and particular attention has been given to correlation errors
   in these quantities.  It has been shown that triple excitations
   significantly decrease the electron affinity.  By neglecting or taking
   insufficient account of triple excitations, some previous calculations
   were biased towards the anion and obtained fortuitously good agreement
   with experiment.  The correlation error of the present calculations is
   such that the calculations are slightly biased towards the neutral
   molecule, but the error is only 0.2 eV.  For the ionization potentials,
   too, triple excitations play an important role.  Reasonable agreement
   with experiment has been achieved by the present calculations.
   Overall, the present study:  (1) underscores the importance of triple
   excitations; (2) shows the success of single-reference couple-cluster
   theory in calculating properties of a single state, even when that
   state has considerable multireference character; and (3) highlights the
   care which must be taken when comparing different electronic states
   with these methods when one or both states have considerable
   multireference character.},

abstract = "The origin of \{C2\} high-pressure bands observed in discharges through \{CO\} has not been cleared up. The suggestion by Little and Browne of a collisional transfer between the metastable \{C2\} (5Πg, v=0) and the radiative \{C2\} (d3Πg, v=6) level was progress. However, these authors claimed that only the combination reaction C+C+M→C2+M should be invoked for the production of the metastable level, excluding the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction that other authors believed to be at the origin of the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. The correlation diagram of the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction shows that C2(5Πg) + \{CO\} correlates with ground-state reactants while C2(d3Πg) + \{CO\} does not. Such a reaction could thus be involved in the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. A kinetic study of these bands in a fast-flow reactor, downstream from a microwave discharge through \{CO\} diluted in He, demonstrated that both reactions C + C + M and C+C2O were involved. It could be concluded that the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction has a lower branching ratio for C2(5Πg) production than C+C+M→C2+M. However, the C+C2O reaction has in most discharges, as in ours, a greater reaction rate than that of the C+C+M reaction so its contribution is not negligible and may be the main one if the dissociation rate of \{CO\} is low.

Abstract = {The C$_2$ molecule exhibits unusual bonding and several low-lying excited
   electronic states, making the prediction of its potential energy curves
   a challenging test for quantum chemical methods. We report full
   configuration interaction results for the X (1)Sigma(g)(+), B
   (1)Delta(g), and B (1)Sigma(g)(+) states of C$_2$, which exactly solve
   the electronic Schrodinger equation within the space spanned by a
   6-31G({*}) basis set. Within the D-2h subgroup used by most electronic
   structure programs, these states all have the same symmetry ((1)A(g)),
   and all three states become energetically close for interatomic
   distances beyond 1.5 Angstrom. The quality of several single-reference
   ab initio methods is assessed by comparison to the benchmark results.
   Unfortunately, even coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triples
   using an unrestricted Hartree-Fock reference exhibits large
   nonparallelity errors (>20 kcal mol(-1)) for the ground state. The
   excited states are not accurately modeled by any commonly used
   single-reference method, nor by configuration interaction including
   full quadruple substitutions. The present benchmarks will be helpful in
   assessing theoretical methods designed to break bonds in ground and
   excited electronic states..},

   essential for highly accurate results: MR-AQCC mean-errors of 0.001
   Angstrom, 10 cm(-1), 300 cm(-1) and 300 cm(-)1 have been obtained for

   choice of method, shortcomings of the calculations. such as Rydberg
   state coupling or insufficient configuration spaces. can be identified
   independently of experimental data. On the other hand, significant
   discrepancies with experiment for states which indicate no shortcomings

The rotational analysis shows conclusively that the molecule responsible is a diatomic molecule containing two carbon nuclei, a conclusion that is further confirmed by the observation of the corresponding system using 13CH4 instead of 12CH4. Neither the upper nor the lower state is one of the known states of C2. None of the predicted low-lying states of C2 fits the observed new states. Two possibilities remain: either the new system corresponds to two fairly highly excited levels of C2 or it is due to the C2− ion. The latter alternative finds some support in the similarity of the new system to the near ultraviolet bands of N2+ (which has the same number of electrons). However, the doublet splitting required by this interpretation has not been resolved, nor has the study of perturbations in the upper state given clear-cut evidence for doublet structure. On the other hand, a mass-spectrometric investigation of the ions in the flash discharge producing the spectrum shows a strong C2− peak, while C2+ is weak. A definitive answer to the question of the carrier of the new spectrum cannot yet be given.}}

abstract = "New rotational line strengths for the \{C2\} Swan system ( d Π g 3 – a Π u 3 ) have been calculated for vibrational bands with v ′ = 0 – 10 and v ″ = 0 – 9 , and J values up to J=34–96, using previous observations in 33 vibrational bands. Line positions from several sources were combined with the results from recent deperturbation studies of the v ′ = 4 and v ′ = 6 levels, and a weighted global least squares fit was performed. The updated molecular constants are reported. The line strengths are based on a recent ab initio calculation of the transition dipole moment function. A line list has been made available, including observed and calculated line positions, Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths (f-values). The line list will be useful for astronomers, combustion scientists and materials scientists who utilize \{C2\} Swan spectra. Einstein A coefficients and f-values were also calculated for the vibrational bands of the Swan system. "

Title = {{C}$_2$ in peculiar {DQ} white dwarfs},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{678}},
Pages = {1292-1297},
Abstract = {{White dwarfs (WDs) with carbon absorption features in their optical
   spectra are known as DQ WDs. The subclass of peculiar DQ WDs are cool
   objects (T-eff less than or similar to 6000 K) that show molecular
   absorption bands that have centroid wavelengths similar to 100-300
   angstrom shortward of the bandheads of the C$_2$ Swan bands. These
   ``peculiar DQ bands'' have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such as C2H.
   We point out that C2H does not show strong absorption bands with
   wavelengths matching those of the peculiar DQ bands, and neither does
   any other simple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool WD
   atmosphere. C$_2$ seems to be the only reasonable candidate for producing
   the peculiar DQ bands. Many characteristics of those bands can be
   understood if they are pressure-shifted Swan bands. While current models
   of WD atmospheres suggest that, in general, peculiar DQ WDs do not have
   higher photospheric pressures than normal DQ WDs do, that finding
   requires confirmation by improved models of WD atmospheres and of the
   behavior of C$_2$ at high pressures and temperatures. If it is eventually
   shown that the peculiar DQ bands cannot be explained as pressure shifted
   Swan bands, the only explanation remaining would seem to be that they
   arise from highly rotationally excited C$_2$ (J(peak) greater than or
   similar to 45). In either case, the absorption band profiles can in
   principle be used to constrain the pressure and the rotational
   temperature of C$_2$ in the line-forming regions of normal and peculiar DQ
   WD atmospheres, which will be useful for comparison with models.
   Finally, we note that progress in understanding magnetic DQ WDs may
   require models that simultaneously consider magnetic fields, high
   pressures, and rotational excitation of C$_2$.}},

   N(CN) = (8-13) x 10(13) cm(-2). C$_2$ absorption lines are also detected

   equal to 3.3 x 10(13) cm(-2) toward Cyg OB2 No. 7 and No. 11. The C$_2$
   observations eliminate the possibility that the molecular material along
   the line of sight towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 is spread over a pathlength of
   several hundred parsecs of very low density n approximate to 10 cm(-3).
   The observations provide some support to a recent chemical model which

   and CN abundances obtained towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 are in agreement with
   the predictions of an X-ray induced chemistry driven by an ionisation
   rate of zeta = (0.6-3) x 10(-15) s(-1). Calculated equilibrium
   temperatures of T = 25-50 K agree with temperatures inferred from C$_2$.
   The model also reproduces the observed column densities of CO and CH,
   and that of H-3(+) to within a factor of two. We predict a H2O+ column
   denity of 2 x 10(12) cm(-2) towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 and H2O+ absorption

   described as having a traditional covalent a bond with the electrons in

Abstract = {{The diatomic carbon molecule has a complex electronic structure with a

   (X-1 Sigma(+)(g), A(1)Pi(u), B-1 Delta(g), and B'(1)Sigma(+)(g)) were
   obtained by high-level ab initio calculations. Valence electron
   correlation was accounted for by the correlation energy extrapolation by
   intrinsic scaling (CEEIS) method. Additional corrections to the PECs
   included core-valence correlation and relativistic effects. Spin-orbit
   corrections were found to be insignificant. The impact of using
   dynamically weighted reference wave functions in conjunction with CEEIS
   was examined and found to give indistinguishable results from the even
   weighted method. The PECs showed multiple curve crossings due to the B-1

Title = {The origin of peculiar molecular bands in cool {DQ} white dwarfs},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{519}},
Abstract = {{Aims. The DQ white dwarfs are stars whose atmosphere is enriched with
   carbon, which for cool stars (T(eff) < 8000 K) is indicated by the Swan
   bands of C(2) in the optical part of their spectra. With decreasing
   effective temperature these molecular bands undergo a significant
   blueshift (similar to 100-300 angstrom). The origin of this phenomenon
   has been disputed over the last two decades and has remained unknown. We
   attempt to address this problem by investigating the impact of dense
   helium on the spectroscopic properties of molecular carbon, the
   electronic Swan band transition energy T(e) and the vibrational
   frequency omega(e), under the physical conditions encountered inside
   helium-rich, fluid-like atmospheres of cool DQ white dwarfs.
   Methods. In our investigation we use a density functional theory based
   quantum mechanical approach.
   Results. The electronic transition energy T(e) increases monotonically
   with the helium density (Delta T(e) (eV) similar to 1.6 rho (g/cm(3))).
   This causes the Swan absorption to occur at shorter wavelengths compared
   with unperturbed C(2). On the other hand the pressure-induced increase
   in the vibrational frequency is insufficient to account for the observed
   Swan bands shifts. Our findings are in line with the shape of the
   distorted molecular bands observed in DQp stars, but the predicted
   photospheric density required to reproduce these spectral features is
   one order of magnitude lower than the one predicted by the current
   models. This indicates pollution by hydrogen or reflects incomplete
   knowledge of the properties of fluid-like atmospheres of these stars.
   Conclusions. Our work shows that at the physical conditions encountered
   in the fluid-like atmospheres of cool DQ white dwarfs the strong
   interactions between C(2) and helium atoms cause an increase in T(e),
   which should produce a blueward shift of the Swan bands. This is
   consistent with the observations and indicates that the observed
   Swan-like molecular bands are most likely the pressure-shifted bands of
   C(2).}},

Measurements using a picosecond laser system in conjunction with a streak camera allowed determination of typical fluorescence lifetimes of levels in the d state and of population changes introduced by rotational energy transfer (RET) and by state-dependent quenching. Excitation−emission spectroscopy yielded two-dimensional maps containing all excitation and all emission spectra in the spectral ranges between 19 340 and 20 150 cm-1 (excitation) and from 546 to 573 nm (emission) and allowed unambiguous assignment of all transitions in this spectral region. Our measurements show a comparatively long quenching lifetime (around 2 ns) and dominant effects of energy transfer on shape and intensity of the acquired spectra (90\% of the fluorescence stems from levels populated by ET). A pronounced dependence of the total RET on the quantum number of the initially excited state is observed. Vibrational energy transfer (VET) is significantly weaker (only 5\% contribution for excitation in the v‘ = 1 level). Implications for quantitative concentration measurements are discussed, and exemplary spatially resolved profiles in a well-characterized low-pressure propene flame are presented. }

   The first comprises several P and R lines of the (1,0) band of the e

   extending past 350 nm. The second is the band head region of the (7,1)

   in these experiments is highly sooting, and the C$_2$ seen here is likely
   produced by laser vaporization of the soot with subsequent laser
   photolysis of a C$_2$ precursor. In a rich flame, this fluorescence could
   cause interferences in other studies such as KrF laser Raman scattering.

Abstract = {{We report on observations and analysis of the C$_2$ Swan band Delta nu = 0
   sequence in the optical spectrum of Comet Hale-Bopp, One set of
   observational data was obtained when this comet was at a large
   heliocentric distance (3.03 AU), This unusual distance provided the
   opportunity to enhance our knowledge of the intercombination transitions
   in C$_2$.
   These transitions are forbidden for electric dipole radiation, but they
   exist due to higher order multipole radiation. Although the transition
   probabilities are several orders of magnitude smaller than allowed
   electronic transitions, the intercombination bands play a key role in
   the fluorescence process of the C$_2$ radical. This role is to provide a
   cooling path for rotational and vibrational populations seen in the
   visible spectrum, Because their exact transition probability is not yet
   completely clear better quantitative knowledge of these transitions can
   help constrain C$_2$ quantities in comets.
   To analyze the data, an equilibrium fluorescence model with 5652
   different vibrational levels was created. This model included the
   triplet and singlet systems of C$_2$ involved in the fluorescence process.
   Theoretical spectra corresponding to different values of the electronic
   transition moments for the a(3)Pi(u)-X(1)Sigma(g)(+) and
   c(3)Sigma(u)(+)- X-1 Sigma(g)(+) transitions were computed. These

  abstract = {{Absorption and emission spectra pertaining to electronic transitions of the short‐lived molecules C2 and CH as present in the reaction zone of low‐pressure oxyacetylene flames are studied. Steady flameabsorption in the 4315‐Å band of CH (2Δ—2Π) is reported for the first time. The concentration of CH in the 2Π(v=0) state is estimated to be [CH]≈1012 cm−3. The absorptionmeasurements of the 0–0 C2 Swan band (3Π g —3Π u ) extend existing measurements in that the rotational structure of the P and R branches is now well resolved. The rotational intensity distributions in emission and absorption are compared and the concentration in the 3Π u state is derived: [C2]≈1013 cm−3. Furthermore it is concluded that the C2 exitatation is nonthermal. This conclusion is supported by the observation of an interesting nonequilibrium rotational intensity distribution in the C2emission spectrum.}}

   abstract={{The ratio of the nascent population of C2 (X1Σ+g) to C2 (A1Πu) to C2 (B′1Σ+g) produced from the photodissociation of C2H at 193 nm has been measured using laser induced fluorescence. This technique is typically used to measure rotational and vibrational distributions in a given electronic state. Here, we have extended the technique to measure the relative electronic distributions in the C2 photofragment. From the simultaneous measurement of the Mulliken (X1Σ+g–D1Σ+u) and Freymark (A1Πu–E1Σ+g) systems, the nascent population ratio of C2 (A1Πu) to C2 (X1Σ+g) molecules was determined. Similarly, from the measurement of the Deslandres–D’Azumbuja (A1Πu–C1Πg) and the LeBlanc (B′1Σ+g–D1Σ+u) systems, the nascent population ratio of C2 (A1Πu) to C2 (B′1Σ+g) was determined. The overall ratio for the production of C2 in the X:A:B′ electronic states was found to be 1:19:1.4. These results along with the results of high quality ab initio calculations of Cui and Morokuma (unpublished) are used to discuss the photodissociation dynamics of C2H at 193 nm. Furthermore, these results should aid in the analysis and modeling of cometary spectra of C2.}},

abstract = "The magnetic rotation observation of the \{C2\} b3Σg− ← a3Πu Ballik-Ramsay system using a color center laser is reported. This is the first detection of this system in absorption. Three bands, 0 ← 1, 1 ← 2, and 2 ← 3, were identified in the spectral range 3650–4030 cm−1. The last two bands were observed for the first time. In magnetic rotation many satellite lines (ΔN ≠ ΔJ) which would be very weak in normal absorption have been observed with intensity comparable to the main branch lines. This permits a slight improvement in the accuracy of some of the fine structure constants. A variety of lineshapes are observed for the various branches by magnetic rotation. Because the b3Σg− fine structure is small, giving a partial overlap, the peak frequency of a magnetic rotation signal usually does not correspond to the center frequency of the normal absorption signal of that transition. A computer program has been written to predict magnetic rotation lineshapes and obtain the peak frequency displacements. Various observed and calculated lineshapes are displayed and compared. "

    abstract = { We report the observation of a new band system of C2, namely the 43Πg--a3Πu system. The bands, observed by resonant 2-photon ionization spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, were identified through a synergy of high-level ab initio computation, and double-resonance spectroscopy. Two bands are firmly identified, 1-3 and 0-2, allowing the 43Πg origin to be placed at 51496.44 cm-1. The 43Πg state is characterized as having a single bond, with a vibrational frequency of about 1268 cm-1, and an equilibrium bond length of 1.57 Å. The state is predicted to exhibit a barrier to dissociation, with a rotational constant that unusually increases with vibrational excitation up to a maximum before decreasing at higher vibrational excitation. The new band system allows us to probe the a3Πu state of C2 through a straightforward 1 + 1 REMPI scheme. }

   electronic lines by means of a time-dependent, 3D, hydrodynamical model
   of the solar atmosphere. Departures from LTE have been considered for
   the C. lines. These turned out to be of increasing importance for
   stronger lines and are crucial to remove a trend in LTE abundances with
   the strengths of the lines. Very gratifying agreement is found among all
   the atomic and molecular abundance diagnostics in spite of their widely
   different line formation sensitivities. The mean value of the solar
   carbon abundance based on the four primary abundance indicators ({[}C
   I], CI, CH vibration-rotation, C(2) Swan) is log epsilon(C) = 8.39 +/-
   0.05, including our best estimate of possible systematic errors.
   Consistent results also come from the CH electronic lines, which we have
   relegated to a supporting role due to their sensitivity to the line
   broadening. The new 3D based solar C abundance is significantly lower
   than previously estimated in studies using 1D model atmospheres.}},

   Indeed, these transitions play a key role in the C$_2$ fluorescence
   process but had never been observed directly so far. We conducted an
   observational program with the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory 4
   m telescope, located in Chile, on September 15(th) and 16(th), 1997. The
   spectral range covered was 1.99 - 2.15 mu m, in order to detect the
   emission lines of the X(1)Sigma(g)(+)-a(3)II(u) (3,0) band, that should
   be degraded to the blue with a bandhead located at 2.127 mu m. This band
   was chosen because of its expected brightness and its wavelength,
   corresponding to a good atmospheric transmission and a relatively low
   sky background. In this paper we present the theoretical calculation
   allowing to model the expected spectrum and the results obtained with
   our observational data. These results, unfortunately, cannot allow the
   detection of the expected emission lines. This is due to a too strong
   noise, generated by the sky background emission lines, that cannot be
   totally removed from the spectrum.}}}
