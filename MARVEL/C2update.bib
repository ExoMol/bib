Abstract = {{The 3(3)Pi(g) state of the dicarbon molecule, C-2, has been identified
   for the first time by a combination of resonant ionization spectroscopy,
   mass spectrometry, and high- level ab initio quantum chemical
   calculations. This marks the discovery of the final valence triplet
   state of C-2 spectroscopically accessible from the lowest triplet state.
   It is found to be vibronically coupled to the recently discovered
   4(3)Pi(g) state, necessitating vibronic calculations beyond the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation to reconcile calculated rotational
   constants with observations. The 3(3)Pi(g) state of C-2 is observed to
   have a much shorter fluorescence lifetime than expected, possibly
   pointing to predissociation by coupling to the unbound d(3)Pi(g) state.}},

Title = {{Experimental and theoretical investigation of the vibrational band
   structure of the 1(5)Pi(u)-1 (5)Pi(g) high-spin system of C-2}},
Journal = JCP,

Volume = {{146}},
Abstract = {{Vibrational levels of the recently observed high-spin transition (1
   (5)Pi(u) - 1 (5)Pi(g)) of dicarbon {[}P. Bornhauser et al., J. Chem.
   Phys. 142, 094313 (2015)] are explored by applying non-linear
   double-resonant four-wave mixing and laser-induced fluorescence methods.
   The deperturbation of the d (3)Pi(g), v = 8 and 1 (5)Pi(g), v = 3 states
   results in accurate molecular constants for the v = 3 ``dark{''} quintet
   state. In addition, the spin-orbit interaction constant is determined
   and parameters for the upper Swan level d (3)Pi(g), v = 8 are improved.
   The first excited vibrational state of 1 (5)Pi(g) is observed by
   performing perturbation-assisted intersystem crossing via ``gateway{''}
   states in the d (3)Pi(g), v = 6 similar to 1 (5)Pi(g), v = 0 system. The
   rotationally resolved spectra yield 11 transitions to 1 (5)Pi(u), v = 1
   that include four spin-substates. Data reduction results in accurate
   molecular constants of this vibrational level in the shallow potential
   energy surface of this state. Finally, 3 = 1 and 2 of the lower quintet
   state (1 (5)Pi(g)) are measured by performing perturbation-assisted
   double-resonant excitation to the 1 (5)Pi(u), v = 0 state and observing
   dispersed fluorescence. The obtained molecular constants are compared
   with high level ab initio computations at the multi-reference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) level of theory by using a large
   correlation consistent basis set or, alternatively, by applying the
   computationally less demanding method of explicitly correlated
   multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI-F12). The spectroscopic
   accuracy of both methods is evaluated by comparison with the
   experimental findings. }},

Title = {{The ionization energy of C-2}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Abstract = {{Resonant two-photon threshold ionization spectroscopy is employed to
   determine the ionization energy of C-2 to 5 meV precision, about two
   orders of magnitude more precise than the previously accepted value.
   Through exploration of the ionization threshold after pumping the 0-3
   band of the newly discovered 4(3)Pi(g) <- a(3)Pi(u) band system of C-2,
   the ionization energy of the lowest rovibronic level of the a(3)Pi(u)
   state was determined to be 11.791(5) eV. Accounting for spin-orbit and
   rotational effects, we calculate that the ionization energy of the
   forbidden origin of the a(3)Pi(u) state is 11.790(5) eV, in excellent
   agreement with quantum thermochemical calculations which give 11.788(10)
   eV. The experimentally derived ionization energy of X-1 Sigma(+)(g)
   state C-2 is 11.866(5) eV. }},
