Title = {{The bending of C$_3$: Experimentally probing the l-type doubling and

Journal = JMS,

Abstract = {C$_3$, a pure carbon chain molecule that has been identified in different
   astronomical environments, is considered a good probe of kinetic
   temperatures through observation of transitions involving its low-lying
   bending mode (nu(2)) in its ground electronic state. The present
   laboratory work aims to investigate this bending mode with multiple
   quanta of excitation by combining recordings of high resolution optical
   and infrared spectra of C3 produced in discharge experiments. The
   optical spectra of rovibronic ((A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) - (X) over tilde
   (1)Sigma(+)(g)) transitions have been recorded by laser induced
   fluorescence spectroscopy using a single longitude mode optical
   parametric oscillator as narrow bandwidth laser source at the University
   of Science and Technology of China. 36 bands originating from (X) over
   tilde (0 upsilon(2)0), upsilon(2) = 0 - 5, are assigned. The
   mid-infrared spectrum of the rovibrational nu(3) band has been recorded
   by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using a globar source on the
   AILES beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. The spectrum reveals
   hot bands involving up to 5 quanta of excitation in nu(2). From
   combining analyses of all the presently recorded spectra and literature
   data, accurate rotational parameters and absolute energy levels of C$_3$,
   in particular for states involving the bending mode, are determined. A
   single PGOPHER file containing all available data involving the (X) over
   tilde and (A) over tilde states (literature and present study) is used
   to fit all the data. The spectroscopic information derived from this
   work enables new interstellar searches for C$_3$, not only in the infrared
   and optical regions investigated here but also notably in the nu(2) band
   region (around 63 cm(-1)) where vibrational satellites can now be
   accurately predicted. This makes C$_3$ a universal diagnostic tool to
   study very different astronomical environments, from dark and dense to
   translucent clouds.},

Title = {{First detection of the carbon chain molecules (CCC)-C-13 and (CCC)-C-13
   towards SgrB2(M)}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {633},
Abstract = {Context. Carbon molecules and their C-13-isotopologues can be used to
   determine the C-12/C-13 abundance ratios in stellar and interstellar
   objects. C$_3$ is a pure carbon chain molecule found in star-forming
   regions and in stellar shells of carbon-rich late-type stars. Latest
   laboratory data of C-13-isotopologues of C$_3$ allow a selective search
   for the mono-substituted species (CCC)-C-13 and (CCC)-C-13 based on
   accurate ro-vibrational frequencies.
   Aims. We aim to provide the first detection of the C-13-isotopologues
   (CCC)-C-13 and (CCC)-C-13 in space and to derive the C-12/C-13 ratio of
   interstellar gas in the massive star-forming region SgrB2(M) near the
   Galactic Center.
   Methods. We used the heterodyne receivers GREAT and upGREAT on board
   SOFIA to search for the ro-vibrational transitions Q(2) and Q(4) of
   (CCC)-C-13 and (CCC)-C-13 at 1.9 THz along the line of sight towards
   SgrB2(M). In addition, to determine the local excitation temperature, we
   analyzed data from nine ro-vibrational transitions of the main
   isotopologue CCC in the frequency range between 1.6 and 1.9 THz, which
   were taken from the Herschel Science Data Archive.
   Results. We report the first detection of the isotopologues (CCC)-C-13
   and (CCC)-C-13. For both species, the ro-vibrational absorption lines
   Q(2) and Q(4) have been identified, primarily arising from the warm gas
   physically associated with the strong continuum source, SgrB2(M). From
   the available CCC ro-vibrational transitions, we derived a gas
   excitation temperature of T-ex = 44.4(-3.9)(+4.7) K, and a total column
   density of N(CCC) = 3.88(-0.35)(+0.39) x 10(15) cm(-2). Assuming the
   excitation temperatures of (CCC)-C-13 and (CCC)-C-13 to be the same as
   for CCC, we obtained column densities of the C-13-isotopologues of
   N((CCC)-C-13) = 2.1(-0.6)(+0.9) x 10(14) cm(-2) and N((CCC)-C-13) =
   2.4(-0.8)(+1.2) x 10(14) cm(-2). The derived C-12/C-13 abundance ratio
   in the C$_3$ molecules is 20.5 +/- 4.2, which is in agreement with the
   elemental ratio of 20, typically observed in SgrB2(M). However, we find
   the N((CCC)-C-13)/N((CCC)-C-13) ratio to be 1.2 +/- 0.1, which is
   shifted from the statistically expected value of two. We propose that
   the discrepant abundance ratio arises due to the lower zero-point energy
   of (CCC)-C-13, which makes position-exchange reaction converting
   (CCC)-C-13 to (CCC)-C-13 energetically favorable.},

Because of the large change in the bending frequency between the 1Σ+g and 1Πu states of C3, the 1Πu state provides one of the best known examples of the coupling of electronic and vibrational motion in linear molecules (the Renner–Teller effect). The 2Σ+ and 2Π states of CCH provide a classic instance of vibronic coupling between two close-lying electronic states, which leads very rapidly to a chaotic pattern of mixed-state vibrational energy levels, which can only be understood by extensive high-quality ab initio calculations. C3Ar is an approximately T-shaped molecule with no less than four large-amplitude vibrations. Its state provides a beautiful example of what happens to the angular momentum of a Π state of C3 when the symmetry is lowered by complex formation.},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {441},
Pages = {1134-1146},
Abstract = {We report the detection of eight vibronic bands of C$_3$, seven of which
   have been hitherto unobserved in astrophysical objects, in the
   translucent cloud towards HD 169454. Four of these bands are also found
   towards two additional objects: HD 73882 and HD 154368. Very high
   signal-to-noise ratio (similar to 1000 and higher) and high resolving
   power (R = 80 000) UVES-VLT spectra (Paranal, Chile) allow for detecting
   novel spectral features of C$_3$, even revealing weak perturbed features
   in the strongest bands. The work presented here provides the most
   complete spectroscopic survey of the so far largest carbon chain
   detected in translucent interstellar clouds. High-quality laboratory
   spectra of C$_3$ are measured using cavity ring-down absorption
   spectroscopy in a supersonically expanding hydrocarbon plasma, to
   support the analysis of the identified bands towards HD 169454. A column
   density of N(C$_3$) = (6.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(12) cm(-2) is inferred and the
   excitation of the molecule exhibits two temperature components; T-exc =
   22 +/- 1 K for the low-J states and T-exc = 187 +/- 25 K for the high-J
   tail. The rotational excitation of C$_3$ is reasonably well explained by
   models involving a mechanism including inelastic collisions, formation
   and destruction of the molecule, and radiative pumping in the
   far-infrared. These models yield gas kinetic temperatures comparable to
   those found for T-exc. The assignment of spectral features in the
   UV-blue range 3793-4054 angstrom may be of relevance for future studies
   aiming at unravelling spectra to identify interstellar molecules
   associated with the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs).},

   and W49N, using Herschel's HIFI instrument. We detect C$_3$ in absorption
   arising from the warm envelope surrounding the hot core, as indicated by
   the velocity peak position and shape of the line profile. The
   sensitivity does not allow to detect C$_3$ absorption due to diffuse
   foreground clouds. From the column densities of the rotational levels in
   the vibrational ground state probed by the absorption we derive a
   rotation temperature (T-rot) of similar to 50-70 K, which is a good
   measure of the kinetic temperature of the absorbing gas, as radiative
   transitions within the vibrational ground state are forbidden. It is
   also in good agreement with the dust temperatures for W31C and W49N.
   Applying the partition function correction based on the derived T-rot,
   we get column densities N(C$_3$) similar to 7-9 x 10(14) cm(-2) and
   abundance x(C$_3$) similar to 10(-8) with respect to H-2. For W31C, using
   a radiative transfer model including far-infrared pumping by the dust
   continuum and a temperature gradient within the source along the line of
   sight we find that a model with x(C$_3$) = 10(-8), T-kin = 30-50 K, N(C$_3$)
   = 1.5 x 10(15) cm(-2) fits the observations reasonably well and provides
   parameters in very good agreement with the simple excitation analysis.},

   the double minimum potential in the Q(3) coordinate, recognized by Izuha
   and Yamanouchi {[}16]. The present work shows that there is also strong
   anharmonic resonance between the overtones of the v(1) and v(3)
   vibrations. For instance, the levels 2 1(+)1 and 0 1(+)3 are nearly
   degenerate in zero order, but as a result of the resonance they give
   rise to two levels 139 cm(-1) apart, centered about the expected
   position of the 2 1(+)1 level. With these irregularities recognized,
   every observed vibrational level up to 30 000 cm(-1) (a vibrational
   energy of over 5000 cm(-1)) can now be assigned. A Sigma(+)(u) vibronic
   level at 30181.4 cm(-1), which has a much lower B' rotational constant
   than nearby levels of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, possibly
   represents the onset of vibronic perturbations by the (B) over
   tilde'(1)Delta(u) electronic state; this state is so far unknown, but is
   predicted by the ab initio calculations of Ahmed et al. {[}36]. (C) 2010},

   state of the C$_3$ radical}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {125},
Abstract = {We report here the first observation of the D (1)Delta(g) state of the
   C$_3$ radical, which provides the first comprehensively analyzed example
   of the dynamic Renner-Teller splitting in Delta symmetry. Two color
   double resonance spectroscopy via the A (1)Pi(u) state was employed to
   experimentally probe an extensive range of vibronic levels in this D
   (1)Delta(g) state, covering all three modes of vibration of C$_3$. The
   analysis was supported by ab initio potential energy surface
   calculations on the C$_3$ radical to outline the lowest eight singlet
   electronic states. Two methods were used to analyze the Renner-Teller
   effect. The first method is an empirical Hamiltonian based on normal
   modes, using harmonic oscillator functions as a basis, with
   Renner-Teller and other terms added as required, which allows
   conventional vibrational parameters to be determined. The second is a
   much larger program that uses the exact kinetic energy operator for a
   triatomic molecule to calculate vibronic energy levels directly from the
   Renner-Teller pair of potential energy surfaces. Both methods give a
   good fit to the experimental results, with only a small adjustment to
   the ab initio surfaces required for the latter. One of the overall
   conclusions is that the Renner-Teller effect is rather smaller in the D
   (1)Delta(g) state than in the A (1)Pi(u) state. },

   analysis of these extra lines shows that at least two long-lived states

   (3)Sigma(u)(-) vibronic state, which may possibly be a high vibrational
   level of the b (3)Pi(g) state, and the other appears to be a P=1 state

   reassignment by McCall of the R(0) line of the 000-000 band, which is
   consistent with the spectra recorded towards a number of stars that
   indicate the presence of C$_3$ in the interstellar medium. Fluorescence
   lifetimes have been measured for a number of upper-state rotational
   levels. The rotational levels of the A (1)Pi(u) state have lifetimes in
   the range of 230-190 ns, decreasing slightly with J; the levels of the

abstract = {The rotationally resolved infrared spectrum of the ν3 band of the long-lived ã3Πu electronic state of C3 has been observed between 1428 and 1473 cm−1 using a tunable diode laser spectrometer. Metastable C3 was produced in a discharge through a flowing mixture of acetylene and helium. The observed band consists of three R and three P branches, which show staggering due to Λ-type doubling and nuclear spin statistics. The band origin of 1449.5255(22) cm−1 is close to the value of 1455.3 cm−1 determined previously from matrix isolation experiments.}

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1995},

Abstract = {Five new triplet bands of C-12(3), and three corresponding bands of
   C-13(3), have been observed in emission between 6000 and 6600 cm(-1)
   with a Fourier transform spectrometer. Rotational analysis shows that
   these bands arise from excited bending vibrations of the (b) over
   tilde(3) Pi(g) --> (a) over tilde(3) Pi(u) electronic transition, and
   that all components of the (010) vibrational level of the (b) over
   tilde(3) Pi(g) state exhibit unusual perturbations. Renner parameters
   for both electronic states have been extracted from an analysis of the
   spin-orbit parameters of the (000) (3) Pi, (010) (3) Delta, (020) (3)
   Phi, and (030) (3) Gamma levels. The Renner effect is shown to be large
   in both electronic states (epsilon' = +0.447, epsilon'' = +0.566).
   Approximate bending vibrational frequencies are also obtained (omega'(2)
   similar to 345 cm(-1), omega''2(s)imilar to 505 cm(-1)).},

Abstract = {The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectrum for the (A) over tilde (1)
   Pi(u)-(X) over tilde(1) Sigma(g)(+) band of laser-vaporized C$_3$ was
   measured under jet-cooled conditions. By careful inspection of the
   rotationally resolved LIF spectrum, eight vibronically allowed
   transitions exhibiting a (1) Sigma(u)(+)-(1) Sigma(g)(+) type rotational
   structure were identified. This finding led to the determination of the
   vibrational energy for the (nu(1), nu(2), nu(3),)=(0, 1(+), 1) level of
   the (A) over tilde state, from which the fundamental wavenumber of the
   nu(3) anti-symmetric mode was estimated to be approximate to 539 cm(-1),
   which is considerably smaller than any of the previous estimates,
   exhibiting a characteristic feature for the transitions from the (X)
   over tilde(0, 0, 1) level were identified. By assigning the (A) over
   tilde(0, 0, 1)(X) over tilde((0, 0, 1) band, the nu(3) fundamental was
   directly determined to be 541.7(1) cm(-1), in excellent agreement with
   the above prediction from the vibronically allowed (1) Sigma(u)-(1)
   Sigma(u)(+) transitions.},

In addition, DF spectra are taken for the well‐known cometary band system, Ã 1Πu–X̃ 1Σ+g. The DF spectra of the new system are very rich and display strong fluorescence bands in stretch–bend progressions that reach as high as 17 000 cm−1 in the 1Σ+g ground state. The data from the DF spectra of both systems is used to assign vibrational term energies to 144 ground‐state levels that cover the range: 0≤v1≤8, 0≤v2≤37, and 0≤v3≤4. The observed level structure clearly demonstrates the highly anharmonic nature of the potential energy surface of C3 and the unusual internal dynamics that occurs upon it. These include pronounced barriers to linearity in the v3=2 and v3=4 states and an increase in molecular rigidity as the symmetric stretch is excited.}",
