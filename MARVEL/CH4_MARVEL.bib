Journal = JQSRT,

Abstract = {The nu(3) fundamental absorption band of methane ((CH4)-C-12) dominates
   the 3.3-3.4 mu m infrared spectral window and has been extensively used
   for atmospheric, planetary and astrophysical investigations.
   Spectroscopic data, such as line positions, line-strengths and
   foreign-collisional coefficients, are needed to analyze the infrared
   spectra of planetary atmospheres for the understanding of relevant
   physical chemistry. In this study, high-resolution infrared spectra of
   (CH4)-C-12 belonging to the nu(3) fundamental vibrational band are
   recorded over 2884-2969 cm -1 with a difference-frequency-generation
   (DFG) laser having a linewidth of Delta nu approximate to 0.0002 cm(-1).
   Line-strengths as well as H-2-, He-, N-2-, O-2-, Ar- and CO2- broadening
   coefficients are determined for 49 methane transitions at room
   temperature. Data are retrieved using Voigt and Galatry profiles to
   compute the measured line shape of each individual transition at various
   pressures. Narrowing coefficients due to Dicke effect are also
   determined. The new data extend and supplement previous measurements
   over the target spectral region (2884-2969 cm(-1)) where very fewer
   studies are reported. In particular, the present work is the first known
   complete determination of broadening data and narrowing parameters at
   high rotational quantum numbers of the P-branch of the nu(3) -CH4 band.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {272},
Abstract = {{As infrared telescopes are finding evidence of methane in hot exoplanet
   atmospheres, it is becoming increasingly important to have accurate
   high-temperature methane absorption models. To evaluate and update
   several spectroscopic databases (HITRAN2016, HITEMP, ExoMol), we
   collected laboratory spectra of the methane icosad (6770-7570 cm$^{-1}$)
   using a 200 MHz (0.0067 cm$^{-1}$) dual frequency comb spectrometer. The
   pure methane data span 18 to 300 Torr and 296 to 1000 K. We found good
   agreement with the HITRAN2016 model spectrum at room temperature, and
   substantial mismatch between our spectra and all absorption models at
   elevated temperature. We present several updates to HITRAN2016 to
   improve agreement with the measured high-temperature spectra.
   Specifically, we assign 4283 lower-state energies which had previously
   been given a default value in HITRAN2016 (E-HIT `' 999 cm$^{-1}$), update
   existing lower-state energies for 92 features, and add 293 new
   high-temperature features in order to improve HITRAN2016 above 300 K.
   Additionally, we update the band-wide line positions by similar to 0.001
   cm$^{-1}$, the self-widths by +7\%, and we estimate band-averaged
   temperature-dependence exponents for self-width (0.85) and self-shift
   (0.58). These measurements are an important step towards merging
   empirical and theoretical high-temperature methane databases, with the
   goal of enabling better understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.}},

ABSTRACT = {Even if on-board mm-wave/THz heterodyne receivers have been developed to measure greenhouse gases (GHGs) atmospheric profiles, rotational spectroscopy rests under-exploited for their monitoring unlike IR rovibrational spectroscopy. The present study deals with the ability of THz spectroscopy using long interaction path-lengths for GHG laboratory investigations. High-resolution THz signatures of non-polar greenhouse molecules may be observed by probing very weak centrifugal distortion induced rotational transitions. To illustrate, new measurements on CH4 and CF4 have been carried out. For CH4, pure rotational transitions, recorded by cw-THz photomixing up to 2.6 THz in a White type cell adjusted to 20 m, have allowed to update the methane line list of atmospheric databases. Concerning CF4, Fabry-Perot THz absorption spectroscopy with a km effective pathlength was required to detect line intensities lower than 10&minus;27 cm&minus;1/(moleccm&minus;2). Contrary to previous synchrotron-based FT-FIR measurements, the tetrahedral splitting of CF4 THz lines is fully resolved. Finally, quantitative measurements of N2O and O3 gas traces have been performed in an atmospheric simulation chamber using a submm-wave amplified multiplier chain coupled to a Chernin type multi-pass cell on a 200 m path-length. The THz monitoring of these two polar GHGs at tropospheric and stratospheric concentrations may be now considered.},

Abstract = {{The ability to precisely model methane absorption in the R(6) manifold
   of the 2 nu(3) band at atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions
   is a key technical requirement of the German-French, Methane Remote
   Sensing Lidar (MERLIN) space mission. To this end, 27 high-resolution
   and high-signal-to-noise-ratio absorption spectra of air-broadened
   $^{12}$CH$_4$ were recorded using a variable-temperature
   frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy apparatus. The
   measurement conditions corresponded to sample temperature, pressure, and
   methane molar fraction values spanning 220-290K, 4-110kPa, and 4-7
   mol/mol, respectively. The measured spectra were fit using the sum of
   isolated Hartmann-Tran profiles with the addition of line mixing. For
   each line within the manifold, all spectroscopic parameters at room
   temperature were fixed to our previously obtained values (Delahaye et
   al., 2016, 10.1002/2015JD024524) and only the
   temperature dependences of the model parameters were adjusted. The
   results show that the fitted model agrees with the measured methane
   absorption to better than 0.3\% for the entire R(6) manifold spectral
   region and to within 0.1\% at the online position of the MERLIN for all
   considered pressure and temperature conditions. A first comparison with
   ground-based atmospheric measurement was also made showing significant
   improvement with respect to existing spectroscopic modeling of methane
   absorption.}},

Additional spectra of $^{12}$CH$_4$ covering the same region were obtained at 100 K and very low sample pressures, which was used for low-J line position identification.

Quantum assignments were made for more than 3500 new transitions, which represent ∼95% of the integrated line intensity observed in this region. The resulting list of lines is much more accurate than the list of lines HITRAN 2016. All assigned 5703 line positions were fitted to RMS standard Deviations of 0.0018  cm$^{-1}$.

abstract = {Triton, the largest Solar System satellite beyond Saturn, was probably captured from the Transneptunian population by Neptune. It is mainly covered by N2, CO, CO2, CH4 and H2O in solid state and, except for H2O and CO2, these species are also present in gas phase. Sublimation and recondensation of the volatile species may lead to geographical and temporal variation on the surface composition, and could participate to the formation of complex chemical compounds formed from photochemistry occurring in the atmosphere (Krasnopolsky and Cruikshank, 1999) or from irradiation of N2 : CH4 : CO layers (Moore and Hudson, 2003). We present new near-IR observations performed at the VLT-ESO with SINFONI in 2010, 2011 and 2013, from which band depths, areas and positions of the main ice features are determined at different longitudes. We also re-reduce and re-analyze earlier data obtained during the last 20 years. Models based on the Hapke theory (Hapke, 1993) are developed to constrain the abundance, grain size, temperature, and state of mixing of the different ices (N2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O) as well as attempt to identify other species. For this purpose, we present and use new optical constants of CO2 measured at 35 and 54 K. Our analyses confirm the longitudinal variation of the N2 and CO surface abundances previously evidenced, and suggest additional latitudinal and/or temporal variability of these two species. We confirm the presence of deep N2 layers in which CO and CH4 are diluted. In particular, we demonstrate that CO is present in diluted (as opposed to pure ice) form. In contrast, our models support the presence of small and longitudinally variable amounts of pure CH4 ice, providing an explanation to the enhanced atmospheric CH4/N2 ratio over expectations based on an ideal N2-CH4-CO mixture. They also suggest significant smaller particles of H2O and CO2 than reported previously in Quirico et al. (1999), with CO2 being probably distributed over a large area of the surface. We find that the 2.40  $\mu$m band is primarily due to 13CO ice, with a telluric value of the 13CO/12CO ratio, and not to ethane. We infer a N2 ice temperature of 37.5  ±  1K, suggesting that the atmospheric pressure over 2010–2013 was similar to that during the Voyager 1989 epoch.}

abstract = {Accurate basis set convergence of first-principles predictions of rotationally resolved spectra at high energy range is a common challenging issue for variational methods. In this paper, a detailed convergence study for the methane spectra is presented both for vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom as well as for intensities. For this purpose, we use our previously reported nine-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces of the methane molecule [Nikitin et al. Chem Phys Lett 2011;501:179–86; 2013;565:5–11]. Vibration–rotation calculations were carried out using variational normal mode approach with a full account of the Td symmetry. The aim was to obtain accurate theoretical methane line lists for the wavenumber range beyond currently available spectra analyses. The focus of this paper is the complicated icosad range (6280–7900 cm$^{-1}$) containing 20 bands and 134 sub-bands where over 90% of experimental lines still remain unassigned. We provide variational line lists converged to a “spectroscopic precision” for icosad transitions for T=80K and T=296K. The first one contains 70300 lines and the second one 286170 lines with the intensity cut-off 10-29 cm$^{-1}$/(moleculecm-2) with Jmax=18. An average error in line positions of theoretical predictions up to J=15 is estimated as 0.2–0.5 cm$^{-1}$ from the comparisons with currently analyzed bands. Ab initio line strength calculations give the integrated intensity 4.37×10-20 cm$^{-1}$/(moleculecm-2) at T=80K for the sum of all icosad bands. This is to be compared to the integrated intensity 4.36×10-20 cm$^{-1}$/(moleculecm-2) of the experimental icosad line list recorded in Grenoble University [Campargue et al., J Mol Spectrosc 2013;291:16–22] using very sensitive laser techniques. The shapes of absorption bands are also in a good qualitative agreement with experimental spectra.}

 abstract = {AbstractThis paper reviews the distribution of methane (CH₄) in our Solar System, as well as its sources and sinks in the atmospheres of the main Solar System bodies. Methane is widely distributed in the Solar System. In general, the inner planets are methane-poor, being Earth a unique exception, whereas the outer planets have CH₄-rich atmospheres. In general, the atmospheric chemistry of this compound is dominated by the solar radiation although in O₂-rich atmospheres this compound participates in a reaction system that removes atmospheric CH₄. In our planet most of the atmospheric CH₄ is produced by lifeforms, reason why scientists have proposed that the simultaneous detection of methane signal along with oxygen (O₂) or ozone (O₃) signals in the atmospheric spectra of planets may be good evidence of life. Therefore, the study of this gas at planetary level is important for understanding the chemical reactions that control its abundance on the exoplanetary atmospheres and to classify possible inhabited planets.},

   substantially extend the accurate knowledge of vibrational band centers

During the past decade, Earth-based telescopic observations reported "plumes" of methane of tens of parts per billion by volume (ppbv), and those from Mars orbit showed localized patches, prompting speculation of sources from subsurface bacteria or nonbiological sources. From in situ measurements made with the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) on Curiosity using a distinctive spectral pattern specific to methane, we report no detection of atmospheric methane with a measured value of 0.18 ± 0.67 ppbv corresponding to an upper limit of only 1.3 ppbv (95% confidence level), which reduces the probability of current methanogenic microbial activity on Mars and limits the recent contribution from extraplanetary and geologic sources.},

abstract = {The IRTF/CSHELL observations in February 2006 at LS=10° and 63–93°W show ∼10ppb of methane at 45°S to 7°N and ∼3ppb outside this region that covers the deepest canyon Valles Marineris. Observations in December 2009 at LS=20° and 0–30°W included spectra of the Moon at a similar airmass as a telluric calibrator. A technique for extraction of the martian methane line from a combination of the Mars and Moon spectra has been developed. The observations reveal no methane with an upper limit of 8ppb. The results of both sessions agree with the observations by Mumma et al. (Mumma, M.J. et al. [2009]. Science 323, 1041–1045) at the same season in February 2006 and are smaller than those in the PFS and TES maps. Production and removal of the biological methane on Mars do not significantly change the redox state of the atmosphere and the balance of hydrogen. A search for ethane at 2977 cm$^{-1}$ results in an upper limit of 0.2ppb. However, this limit does not help to establish the origin of methane on Mars. Reanalysis of our search for SO2 using TEXES confirms the recently established upper limit of 0.3ppb. Along with the lack of hot spots and gas vents with endogenic heat sources in the THEMIS observations, the very low upper limit to SO2 on Mars does not favor geological methane that is less abundant than SO2 in the outgassing from the terrestrial planets.}

abstract = {There have been several reports of methane on Mars at the 10–60ppbv level. Most suggest that methane is both seasonally and latitudinally variable. Here we review why variable methane on Mars is physically and chemically implausible, and then we critically review the published reports. There is no known mechanism for destroying methane chemically on Mars. But if there is one, methane oxidation would deplete the O2 in Mars’s atmosphere in less than 10,000 years unless balanced by an equally large unknown source of oxidizing power. Physical sequestration does not raise these questions, but adsorption in the regolith or condensation in clathrates ignore competition for adsorption sites or are inconsistent with clathrate stability, respectively. Furthermore, any mechanism that relies on methane’s van der Waals’ attraction is inconsistent with the continued presence of Xe in the atmosphere at the 60ppbv level. We then use the HITRAN database and transmission calculations to identify and characterize the absorption lines that would be present on Earth or Mars at the wavelengths of the published observations. These reveal strong competing telluric absorption that is most problematic at just those wavelengths where methane’s signature seems most clearly seen from Earth. The competing telluric lines must be removed with models. The best case for martian methane was made for the $^{12}$CH$_4$ ν3 R0 and R1 lines seen in blueshift when Mars was approaching Earth in early 2003 (Mumma, M.J., Villanueva, G.L., Novak, R.E., Hewagama, T., Bonev, B.P., DiSanti, M.A., Mandell, A.M., Smith, M.D. [2009]. Science 323, 1041–1045). For these the Doppler shift moves the two martian lines into near coincidence with telluric 13CH4 ν3 R1 and R2 lines that are 10–50× stronger than the inferred martian lines. By contrast, the $^{12}$CH$_4$ ν3 R0 and R1 lines when observed in redshift do not contend with telluric 13CH4. For these lines, Mumma et al.’s observations and analyses are consistent with an upper limit on the order of 3ppbv.}

The multispectrum fitting procedure has been applied to these spectra to recover the spectral line parameters. The main goal of this procedure was the determination of the N2- and O2-broadening and shifting coefficients and the exponents of their temperature dependences. These parameters have been derived for 452 assigned lines with good values of the signal to noise ratio. The rotational dependence of the mean values of these parameters is discussed. The temperature dependence exponents were observed for both N2 and O2 buffer gases.}

The mole fractions show no hemispherical asymmetries or latitudinal variability. The analysis combines data from the far-IR methane rotational lines and the mid-IR features of methane and its isotopologues, using both the correlated-k retrieval algorithm of Irwin et al. [Irwin, P., and 9 colleagues, 2008. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 109, 1136–1150] and a line-by-line approach to evaluate the reliability of the retrieved quantities. C/H was found to be enhanced by 10.9±0.5 times the solar composition of Grevesse et al. [Grevesse, N., Asplund, M., Sauval, A., 2007. Space Sci. Rev. 130 (1), 105–114], 2.25±0.55 times larger than the enrichment on Jupiter, and supporting the increasing fractional core mass with distance from the Sun predicted by the core accretion model of planetary formation. A comparison of the jovian and saturnian C/N, C/S and C/P ratios suggests different reservoirs of the trapped volatiles in a primordial solar nebula whose composition varies with distance from the Sun. This is supported by our derived D/H ratio in methane of (1.6±0.2)×10-5, which appears to be smaller than the jovian value of Lellouch et al. [Lellouch, E., Bézard, B., Fouchet, T., Feuchtgruber, H., Encrenaz, T., de Graauw, T., 2001. Astron. Astrophys. 370, 610–622]. Mid-IR emission features provided an estimate of C12/C13=91.8-7.8+8.4, which is consistent with both the terrestrial ratio and jovian ratio, suggesting that carbon was accreted from a shared reservoir for all of the planets.}

title = {Global warming},
journal = {Rep. Prog. Phys.},
abstract = {‘Global warming’ is a phrase that refers to the effect on the climate of human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and large-scale deforestation, which cause emissions to the atmosphere of large amounts of ‘greenhouse gases’, of which the most important is carbon dioxide. Such gases absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and act as blankets over the surface keeping it warmer than it would otherwise be. Associated with this warming are changes of climate. The basic science of the ‘greenhouse effect’ that leads to the warming is well understood. More detailed understanding relies on numerical models of the climate that integrate the basic dynamical and physical equations describing the complete climate system. Many of the likely characteristics of the resulting changes in climate (such as more frequent heat waves, increases in rainfall, increase in frequency and intensity of many extreme climate events) can be identified. Substantial uncertainties remain in knowledge of some of the feedbacks within the climate system (that affect the overall magnitude of change) and in much of the detail of likely regional change. Because of its negative impacts on human communities (including for instance substantial sea-level rise) and on ecosystems, global warming is the most important environmental problem the world faces. Adaptation to the inevitable impacts and mitigation to reduce their magnitude are both necessary. International action is being taken by the world's scientific and political communities. Because of the need for urgent action, the greatest challenge is to move rapidly to much increased energy efficiency and to non-fossil-fuel energy sources.}

abstract = {We present eight new 0.8 to 2.4  $\mu$m spectral observations of Neptune's satellite Triton, obtained at IRTF/SpeX during 2002 July 15–22 UT. Our objective was to determine how Triton's near-infrared spectrum varies as Triton rotates, and to establish an accurate baseline for comparison with past and future observations. The most striking spectral change detected was in Triton's nitrogen ice absorption band at 2.15  $\mu$m; its strength varies by about a factor of two as Triton rotates. Maximum N2 absorption approximately coincides with Triton's Neptune-facing hemisphere, which is also the longitude where the polar cap extends nearest Triton's equator. More subtle rotational variations are reported for Triton's CH4 and H2O ice absorption bands. Unlike the other ices, Triton's CO2 ice absorption bands remain nearly constant as Triton rotates. Triton's H2O ice is shown to be crystalline, rather than amorphous. Triton's N2 ice is confirmed to be the warmer, hexagonal, β N2 phase, and its CH4 is confirmed to be highly diluted in N2 ice.}

abstract = {Using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, we observed a spectrum of Mars at the P-branch of the strongest CH4 band at 3.3  $\mu$m with resolving power of 180,000 for the apodized spectrum. Summing up the spectral intervals at the expected positions of the 15 strongest Doppler-shifted martian lines, we detected the absorption by martian methane at a 3.7 sigma level which is exactly centered in the summed spectrum. The observed CH4 mixing ratio is 10±3 ppb. Total photochemical loss of CH4 in the martian atmosphere is equal to 2.2×105 cm-2s-1, the CH4 lifetime is 340 years and methane should be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous loss of atmospheric methane is probably negligible, while the sink of CH4 during its diffusion through the regolith may be significant. There are no processes of CH4 formation in the atmosphere, so the photochemical loss must therefore be balanced by abiogenic and biogenic sources. Outgassing from Mars is weak, the latest volcanism is at least 10 million years old, and thermal emission imaging from the Mars Odyssey orbiter does not reveal any hot spots on Mars. Hydrothermal systems can hardly be warmer than the room temperature at which production of methane is very low in terrestrial waters. Therefore a significant production of hydrothermal and magmatic methane is not very likely on Mars. The calculated average production of CH4 by cometary impacts is 2% of the methane loss. Production of methane by meteorites and interplanetary dust does not exceed 4% of the methane loss. Methane cannot originate from an extinct biosphere, as in the case of “natural gas” on Earth, given the exceedingly low limits on organic matter set by the Viking landers and the dry recent history which has been extremely hostile to the macroscopic life needed to generate the gas. Therefore, methanogenesis by living subterranean organisms is a plausible explanation for this discovery. Our estimates of the biomass and its production using the measured CH4 abundance show that the martian biota may be extremely scarce and Mars may be generally sterile except for some oases.}

   transition moment parallel tomu(nu)parallel to=(1.0+/-0.1)x10(-3) D have
   been determined. The values represent benchmarks to test effective
   vibrational Hamiltonians and ab initio calculations for methane.
   Although an isolated band analysis was possible at low J-values, the
   influence of strong perturbations becomes evident at higher rotational
   excitation. The F-1-component of $

   Coriolis resonance with the IR-active F-2-component appears to be a

Abstract = {In its December 1990 fly-by of Earth, the Galileo spacecraft found
   evidence of abundant gaseous oxygen, a widely distributed surface
   pigment with a sharp absorption edge in the red part of the visible
   spectrum, and atmospheric methane in extreme thermodynamic
   disequilibrium; together, these are strongly suggestive of life on
   Earth. Moreover, the presence of narrow-band, pulsed,
   amplitude-modulated radio transmission seems uniquely attributable to
   intelligence. These observations constitute a control experiment for the
   search for extraterrestrial life by modern interplanetary spacecraft.},

An additional band in the Triton data is not methane. The Triton spectral data conform more closely to a laboratory spectrum of frozen methane than to a synthetic spectrum of methane gas computed for conditions of low temperature expected at the satellite. Additionally, the strength of the bands vary with Triton's orbital position. The data thus suggest that methane in the ice phase is mostly responsible for the bands in Triton's spectrum, and that the ice is distributed nonuniformly around the satellite's surface.}

Ne, N2, O2, Ar, CO, H2O, SO2, and CO2 were measured, and upper limits set for H2, COS, H2S, CH4, Kr, N2O, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8. Simulation studies have provided indirect evidence for sulfuric acid-like droplets and support the possibility of water vapor at altitudes of 42 and 24 km.

abstract = {The frequencies of two infrared lasers stabilized by molecular absorption lines have been measured by using a frequency-synthesis chain extending down to the caesium frequency standard. The measured values are 29,477,160,852+or-16 kHz for the R(32), 10.17 $\mu$m transition of CO2 and 88,376,181,608+or-43 kHz for the F2(2) component of the P(7) transition in the nu 3 band of methane. These values are in good agreement with previous determinations and are obtained using the value 32,176,079,482 kHz measured previously for a stabilized CO2 laser operating on the R(12), 9.3 $\mu$m transition.}
