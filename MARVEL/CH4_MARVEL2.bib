A new experimental setup is described, allowing us to carry out cw-laser cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) at instrumental resolution in the MHz range in seeded supersonic jet expansions down to rotational temperature of 7 K compared to previous cw-CRDS measurements in our group achieving about 50 K in expansions of neat CH4. We provide a careful re-analysis on the basis of our new experimental results for the Q and R branch transitions including data obtained between about 7 and 300 K under various conditions. We resolve previously observed discrepancies of assignments and are able to present a definitive assignment for lines involving angular momentum quantum numbers up to J = 4. The analysis of relative intensities in spectra taken at rotational and effective translational temperatures between about 50 K and less than 10 K indicate conservation of nuclear spin symmetry upon supersonic jet expansion, in agreement with previous results using other techniques and covering other spectral ranges. }

   cm(-1)}},
Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {{We have recorded the complete infrared spectrum of methane (CH4)-C-12
   and its second most abundant isotopomer (CH4)-C-13 extending from the
   fundamental range starting at 1000 cm(-1) up to the overtone region near
   12 000 cm(-1) in the near infrared at the limit towards the visible
   range, at temperatures of about 80 K and also at 298 K with Doppler
   limited resolution in the gas phase by means of interferometric Fourier
   transform spectroscopy using the Bruker IFS 125 HR prototype (ZP 2001)
   of the ETH Zurich laboratory. This provides the so far most complete
   data set on methane spectra in this range at high resolution. In the
   present work we report in particular those results, where the partial
   rovibrational analysis allows for the direct assignment of pure (J = 0)
   vibrational levels including high excitation. These results
   substantially extend the accurate knowledge of vibrational band centers
   to higher energies and provide a benchmark for both the comparison with
   theoretical results on the one hand and atmospheric spectroscopy on the
   other hand. We also present a simple effective Hamiltonian analysis,
   which is discussed in terms of vibrational level assignments and C-13
   isotope effects. }},

abstract = "Abstract Several Doppler-limited rotational transitions of methane induced by centrifugal distortion have been measured with an unprecedented frequency accuracy using a \{THz\} photomixing synthesizer based on a frequency comb. Compared to previous synchrotron based FT-Far-IR measurements of Boudon et al. (Ref. [1]), the accuracy of the line frequency measurements is improved by one order of magnitude; this yields a corresponding increase of two orders of magnitude to the weighting of these transitions in the global fit. The rotational transitions in the ν 4 ← ν 4 hot band are measured for the first time by the broad spectral coverage of the photomixing CW-THz spectrometer providing access up to R(5) transitions at 2.6 THz. The new global fit including the present lines has been used to update the methane line list of the \{HITRAN\} database. Some small, but significant variations of the parameter values are observed and are accompanied by a reduction of the 1-σ uncertainties on the rotational (B0) and centrifugal distortion (D0) constants.

abstract = "Abstract A new study of 12CH4 line positions and intensities was performed for part of the Tetradecad region between 5300 and 5550 cm−1 using four long path (202 m, 602 m, 1604 m and 1804 m) spectra of normal samples of CH4 at different pressures recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer in Reims, France. Line positions and intensities were retrieved by least square curve-fitting procedures and analyzed using the effective Hamiltonian and the effective dipole moment expressed in terms of irreducible tensor operators adapted to spherical top molecules. An 80 K spectrum from JPL of enriched 12CH4 was used for low-J line positions. One other 80 K spectrum from JPL of enriched 13CH4 was used to discern the isotopic lines. A new measured linelist contains positions and intensities for 5934 features. Quantum assignments were made for 2847 transitions, which represent ∼90\% of the integrated line intensity observed in this region. All assigned line positions and 2227 selected line intensities were fitted with RMS standard deviations of 0.0025 cm−1 and 8.6\%, respectively. The sum of observed intensities between 5300 and 5550 cm−1 fell within 2\% of the predicted value from ab initio variational calculations."
