Title = {{Dual frequency comb absorption spectroscopy of CH4 up to 1000 Kelvin
   from 6770 to 7570 cm(-1)}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{272}},
Abstract = {{As infrared telescopes are finding evidence of methane in hot exoplanet
   atmospheres, it is becoming increasingly important to have accurate
   high-temperature methane absorption models. To evaluate and update
   several spectroscopic databases (HITRAN2016, HITEMP, ExoMol), we
   collected laboratory spectra of the methane icosad (6770-7570 cm(-1))
   using a 200 MHz (0.0067 cm(-1)) dual frequency comb spectrometer. The
   pure methane data span 18 to 300 Torr and 296 to 1000 K. We found good
   agreement with the HITRAN2016 model spectrum at room temperature, and
   substantial mismatch between our spectra and all absorption models at
   elevated temperature. We present several updates to HITRAN2016 to
   improve agreement with the measured high-temperature spectra.
   Specifically, we assign 4283 lower-state energies which had previously
   been given a default value in HITRAN2016 (E-HIT `' 999 cm(-1)), update
   existing lower-state energies for 92 features, and add 293 new
   high-temperature features in order to improve HITRAN2016 above 300 K.
   Additionally, we update the band-wide line positions by similar to 0.001
   cm(-1), the self-widths by +7\%, and we estimate band-averaged
   temperature-dependence exponents for self-width (0.85) and self-shift
   (0.58). These measurements are an important step towards merging
   empirical and theoretical high-temperature methane databases, with the
   goal of enabling better understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.}},

VOLUME = {11},

ABSTRACT = {Even if on-board mm-wave/THz heterodyne receivers have been developed to measure greenhouse gases (GHGs) atmospheric profiles, rotational spectroscopy rests under-exploited for their monitoring unlike IR rovibrational spectroscopy. The present study deals with the ability of THz spectroscopy using long interaction path-lengths for GHG laboratory investigations. High-resolution THz signatures of non-polar greenhouse molecules may be observed by probing very weak centrifugal distortion induced rotational transitions. To illustrate, new measurements on CH4 and CF4 have been carried out. For CH4, pure rotational transitions, recorded by cw-THz photomixing up to 2.6 THz in a White type cell adjusted to 20 m, have allowed to update the methane line list of atmospheric databases. Concerning CF4, Fabry-Perot THz absorption spectroscopy with a km effective pathlength was required to detect line intensities lower than 10&minus;27 cm&minus;1/(moleccm&minus;2). Contrary to previous synchrotron-based FT-FIR measurements, the tetrahedral splitting of CF4 THz lines is fully resolved. Finally, quantitative measurements of N2O and O3 gas traces have been performed in an atmospheric simulation chamber using a submm-wave amplified multiplier chain coupled to a Chernin type multi-pass cell on a 200 m path-length. The THz monitoring of these two polar GHGs at tropospheric and stratospheric concentrations may be now considered.},

We show that with interleaving the spectral point spacing is reduced by more than four orders of magnitude over the full spectral span of the frequency comb. The potential of this technique for high-precision gas sensing is illustrated by measuring the low pressure (107 hPa) absorption and dispersion spectra of methane spanning the range of 1170 cm\&\#x2212;1 - 1225 cm\&\#x2212;1 with a resolution of 0.001 cm\&\#x2212;1.},

Title = {{Measurement and Modeling of Air-Broadened Methane Absorption in the
   MERLIN Spectral Region at Low Temperatures}},
Journal = {JGR-Atmospheres},
Year = {{2019}},
Pages = {3556-3564},
Abstract = {{The ability to precisely model methane absorption in the R(6) manifold
   of the 2 nu(3) band at atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions
   is a key technical requirement of the German-French, Methane Remote
   Sensing Lidar (MERLIN) space mission. To this end, 27 high-resolution
   and high-signal-to-noise-ratio absorption spectra of air-broadened
   (CH4)-C-12 were recorded using a variable-temperature
   frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy apparatus. The
   measurement conditions corresponded to sample temperature, pressure, and
   methane molar fraction values spanning 220-290K, 4-110kPa, and 4-7
   mol/mol, respectively. The measured spectra were fit using the sum of
   isolated Hartmann-Tran profiles with the addition of line mixing. For
   each line within the manifold, all spectroscopic parameters at room
   temperature were fixed to our previously obtained values (Delahaye et
   al., 2016, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JD024524) and only the
   temperature dependences of the model parameters were adjusted. The
   results show that the fitted model agrees with the measured methane
   absorption to better than 0.3\% for the entire R(6) manifold spectral
   region and to within 0.1\% at the online position of the MERLIN for all
   considered pressure and temperature conditions. A first comparison with
   ground-based atmospheric measurement was also made showing significant
   improvement with respect to existing spectroscopic modeling of methane
   absorption.}},

abstract = "Eight spectra of normal samples of CH4 in the 3760–4100 cm−1 region were recorded by using a Fourier transform spectrometer in Reims, France at long paths (202 m, 602 m, 1604 m and 1804 m) and different pressures. Additional spectra of 12CH4 covering the same region were obtained at 100 K and very low sample pressures, which was used for low-J line position identification. Line positions and intensities were retrieved by least squares curve-fitting procedures and analyzed using the effective Hamiltonian and the effective dipole. A new measured line list contains positions and intensities for 9000 features. Quantum assignments were made for more than 3500 new transitions, which represent ∼95% of the integrated line intensity observed in this region. The resulting list of lines is much more accurate than the list of lines HITRAN 2016. All assigned 5703 line positions were fitted to RMS standard Deviations of 0.0018 cm−1. The sum of observed intensities between 3760 and 4100 cm−1 fell within 2% of the predicted value from ab initio variational calculations reported in the TheoReTS database (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr; http://theorets.tsu.ru)."

To demonstrate it, a baseline-immune Lamb dip spectrum of the R1A2 transitions in the 2v2 $+$ v3 band of methane was recorded.

frequency accuracy using a \{THz\} photomixing synthesizer based on a frequency

al. (Ref. [1]), the accuracy of the line frequency measurements is improved by
one order of magnitude; this yields a corresponding increase of two orders of
magnitude to the weighting of these transitions in the global fit. The
rotational transitions in the  4 hot band are measured for the
first time by the broad spectral coverage of the photomixing CW-THz spectrometer
providing access up to R(5) transitions at 2.6 THz. The new global fit including
the present lines has been used to update the methane line list of the
\{HITRAN\} database. Some small, but significant variations of the parameter
values are observed and are accompanied by a reduction of the 1% uncertainties
on the rotational (B0) and centrifugal distortion (D0) constants.},

using the effective Hamiltonian and the effective dipole moment expressed in
terms of irreducible tensor operators adapted to spherical top molecules. An
80 K spectrum from JPL of enriched 12CH4 was used for low-J line
positions. One other 80 K spectrum from JPL of enriched 13CH4 was used to
discern the isotopic lines. A new measured linelist contains positions and
intensities for 5934 features. Quantum assignments were made for 2847
transitions, which represent 90\% of the integrated line intensity
observed in this region. All assigned line positions and 2227 selected line
intensities were fitted with RMS standard Deviations of 0.0025 cm-1

Abstract = {{In this article we describe a high-precision laboratory measurement
   targeting the R(6) manifold of the 2.3 band of (CH4)-C-12. High-fidelity
   modeling of this absorption spectrum for atmospheric temperature and
   pressure conditions will be required by the Franco-German, Methane
   Remote Sensing LIDAR (MERLIN) space mission for retrievals of
   atmospheric methane. The analysis uses the Hartmann-Tran profile for
   modeling line shape and also includes line-mixing effects. To this end,
   six high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio absorption spectra of
   air-broadened methane were recorded using a frequency-stabilized cavity
   ring-down spectroscopy apparatus. Sample conditions corresponded to room
   temperature and spanned total sample pressures of 40 hPa-1013 hPa with
   methane molar fractions between 1 mu mol mol(-1) and 12 mu mol mol(-1).
   All spectroscopicmodel parameters were simultaneously adjusted in
   amultispectrum nonlinear least squares fit to the six measured spectra.
   Comparison of the fitted model to the measured spectra reveals the
   ability to calculate the room temperature, methane absorption
   coefficient to better than 0.1\% at the online position of
   theMERLINmission. This is the first time that such fidelity has been
   reached in modelingmethane absorption in the investigated spectral
   region, fulfilling the accuracy requirements of the MERLIN mission. We
   also found excellent agreement when comparing the present results with
   measurements obtained over different pressure conditions and using other
   laboratory techniques. Finally, we also evaluated the impact of these
   new spectral parameters on atmospheric transmissions spectra
   calculations.}},

abstract = {Accurate basis set convergence of first-principles predictions of rotationally resolved spectra at high energy range is a common challenging issue for variational methods. In this paper, a detailed convergence study for the methane spectra is presented both for vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom as well as for intensities. For this purpose, we use our previously reported nine-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces of the methane molecule [Nikitin et al. Chem Phys Lett 2011;501:179–86; 2013;565:5–11]. Vibration–rotation calculations were carried out using variational normal mode approach with a full account of the Td symmetry. The aim was to obtain accurate theoretical methane line lists for the wavenumber range beyond currently available spectra analyses. The focus of this paper is the complicated icosad range (6280–7900cm−1) containing 20 bands and 134 sub-bands where over 90% of experimental lines still remain unassigned. We provide variational line lists converged to a “spectroscopic precision” for icosad transitions for T=80K and T=296K. The first one contains 70300 lines and the second one 286170 lines with the intensity cut-off 10−29cm−1/(moleculecm−2) with Jmax=18. An average error in line positions of theoretical predictions up to J=15 is estimated as 0.2–0.5cm−1 from the comparisons with currently analyzed bands. Ab initio line strength calculations give the integrated intensity 4.37×10−20cm−1/(moleculecm−2) at T=80K for the sum of all icosad bands. This is to be compared to the integrated intensity 4.36×10−20cm−1/(moleculecm−2) of the experimental icosad line list recorded in Grenoble University [Campargue et al., J Mol Spectrosc 2013;291:16–22] using very sensitive laser techniques. The shapes of absorption bands are also in a good qualitative agreement with experimental spectra.}

 abstract = {AbstractThis paper reviews the distribution of methane (CH₄) in our Solar System, as well as its sources and sinks in the atmospheres of the main Solar System bodies. Methane is widely distributed in the Solar System. In general, the inner planets are methane-poor, being Earth a unique exception, whereas the outer planets have CH₄-rich atmospheres. In general, the atmospheric chemistry of this compound is dominated by the solar radiation although in O₂-rich atmospheres this compound participates in a reaction system that removes atmospheric CH₄. In our planet most of the atmospheric CH₄ is produced by lifeforms, reason why scientists have proposed that the simultaneous detection of methane signal along with oxygen (O₂) or ozone (O₃) signals in the atmospheric spectra of planets may be good evidence of life. Therefore, the study of this gas at planetary level is important for understanding the chemical reactions that control its abundance on the exoplanetary atmospheres and to classify possible inhabited planets.},

Abstract = {{We have recorded the complete infrared spectrum of methane (CH4)-C-12
   and its second most abundant isotopomer (CH4)-C-13 extending from the
   fundamental range starting at 1000 cm(-1) up to the overtone region near
   12 000 cm(-1) in the near infrared at the limit towards the visible
   range, at temperatures of about 80 K and also at 298 K with Doppler
   limited resolution in the gas phase by means of interferometric Fourier
   transform spectroscopy using the Bruker IFS 125 HR prototype (ZP 2001)
   of the ETH Zurich laboratory. This provides the so far most complete
   data set on methane spectra in this range at high resolution. In the
   present work we report in particular those results, where the partial
   rovibrational analysis allows for the direct assignment of pure (J = 0)
   vibrational levels including high excitation. These results
   substantially extend the accurate knowledge of vibrational band centers
   to higher energies and provide a benchmark for both the comparison with
   theoretical results on the one hand and atmospheric spectroscopy on the
   other hand. We also present a simple effective Hamiltonian analysis,
   which is discussed in terms of vibrational level assignments and C-13
   isotope effects.}},

methane 12CH4 in the so-called Tetradecad region from 2.1 to 1.6 -F�m (4760%G–%@6250-A

temperature combined with improved theoretical modeling have allowed quantum
assignments to be greatly extended in this region. A global fit of all assigned
lines of 12CH4 in the 0%G–%@6200 cm%G−%@1 region has been performed. In the end{,} 3012
line positions and 1387 intensities of 45 individual subbands of the Tetradecad
were modeled up to J = 14. The root mean square Deviations were 0.023 cm%G−%@1 for
line positions and 13.86% for line intensities in the Tetradecad region itself.
Although this analysis is still preliminary{,} it is already sufficient to
characterize the stronger bands throughout the whole of the Tetradecad. The
calculated integrated intensity of the polyad is 1.399 � 10%G−%@19 cm%G−%@1/(molecule

abstract = {The intensity distribution of absorption spectroscopy of methane mid-infrared fundamental absorption bands, near-infrared combination band of v2+2v3 and overtone band of 2v3 were discussed in details in this paper. Quantitative data showed that the absorption intensities of fundamental bands are twice larger than overtone bands, and three times larger than combination bands. Based on the methane 3.31μm (v3) fundamental absorption bands and differential signal disposal method, a rotational ellipsoidal light structure was designed using ordinary light source and detector to improve gas detection sensitivity. The experimental results of concentration detection showed that the precision of concentration measurement can reach 3% and detection sensitivity is 50ppm. Meanwhile, experiment was performed to investigate the influence of temperature on mid-infrared absorption performance of methane and the experience curve of 3.31μm (v3) fundamental absorption signal depending on temperature and its rate of change was drawn.}

abstract = {The absorption spectra of mixtures of methane (CH4) with N2 and O2 at different partial pressures of both CH4 and buffer gases for three temperatures 240, 267, and 296K have been recorded using the Bruker IFS 125 HR FTIR spectrometer in the 5550–6236cm−1 region. The multispectrum fitting procedure has been applied to these spectra to recover the spectral line parameters. The main goal of this procedure was the determination of the N2- and O2-broadening and shifting coefficients and the exponents of their temperature dependences. These parameters have been derived for 452 assigned lines with good values of the signal to noise ratio. The rotational dependence of the mean values of these parameters is discussed. The temperature dependence exponents were observed for both N2 and O2 buffer gases.}

abstract = {High spectral resolution observations from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer [Flasar, F.M., and 44 colleagues, 2004. Space Sci. Rev. 115, 169–297] are analysed to derive new estimates for the mole fractions of CH4, CH3D and 13CH4 of (4.7±0.2)×10−3, (3.0±0.2)×10−7 and (5.1±0.2)×10−5 respectively. The mole fractions show no hemispherical asymmetries or latitudinal variability. The analysis combines data from the far-IR methane rotational lines and the mid-IR features of methane and its isotopologues, using both the correlated-k retrieval algorithm of Irwin et al. [Irwin, P., and 9 colleagues, 2008. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 109, 1136–1150] and a line-by-line approach to evaluate the reliability of the retrieved quantities. C/H was found to be enhanced by 10.9±0.5 times the solar composition of Grevesse et al. [Grevesse, N., Asplund, M., Sauval, A., 2007. Space Sci. Rev. 130 (1), 105–114], 2.25±0.55 times larger than the enrichment on Jupiter, and supporting the increasing fractional core mass with distance from the Sun predicted by the core accretion model of planetary formation. A comparison of the jovian and saturnian C/N, C/S and C/P ratios suggests different reservoirs of the trapped volatiles in a primordial solar nebula whose composition varies with distance from the Sun. This is supported by our derived D/H ratio in methane of (1.6±0.2)×10−5, which appears to be smaller than the jovian value of Lellouch et al. [Lellouch, E., Bézard, B., Fouchet, T., Feuchtgruber, H., Encrenaz, T., de Graauw, T., 2001. Astron. Astrophys. 370, 610–622]. Mid-IR emission features provided an estimate of C12/C13=91.8−7.8+8.4, which is consistent with both the terrestrial ratio and jovian ratio, suggesting that carbon was accreted from a shared reservoir for all of the planets.}

title = {Global warming},
journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {‘Global warming’ is a phrase that refers to the effect on the climate of human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) and large-scale deforestation, which cause emissions to the atmosphere of large amounts of ‘greenhouse gases’, of which the most important is carbon dioxide. Such gases absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and act as blankets over the surface keeping it warmer than it would otherwise be. Associated with this warming are changes of climate. The basic science of the ‘greenhouse effect’ that leads to the warming is well understood. More detailed understanding relies on numerical models of the climate that integrate the basic dynamical and physical equations describing the complete climate system. Many of the likely characteristics of the resulting changes in climate (such as more frequent heat waves, increases in rainfall, increase in frequency and intensity of many extreme climate events) can be identified. Substantial uncertainties remain in knowledge of some of the feedbacks within the climate system (that affect the overall magnitude of change) and in much of the detail of likely regional change. Because of its negative impacts on human communities (including for instance substantial sea-level rise) and on ecosystems, global warming is the most important environmental problem the world faces. Adaptation to the inevitable impacts and mitigation to reduce their magnitude are both necessary. International action is being taken by the world's scientific and political communities. Because of the need for urgent action, the greatest challenge is to move rapidly to much increased energy efficiency and to non-fossil-fuel energy sources.}

abstract = {Using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope, we observed a spectrum of Mars at the P-branch of the strongest CH4 band at 3.3 μm with resolving power of 180,000 for the apodized spectrum. Summing up the spectral intervals at the expected positions of the 15 strongest Doppler-shifted martian lines, we detected the absorption by martian methane at a 3.7 sigma level which is exactly centered in the summed spectrum. The observed CH4 mixing ratio is 10±3 ppb. Total photochemical loss of CH4 in the martian atmosphere is equal to 2.2×105 cm−2s−1, the CH4 lifetime is 340 years and methane should be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere. Heterogeneous loss of atmospheric methane is probably negligible, while the sink of CH4 during its diffusion through the regolith may be significant. There are no processes of CH4 formation in the atmosphere, so the photochemical loss must therefore be balanced by abiogenic and biogenic sources. Outgassing from Mars is weak, the latest volcanism is at least 10 million years old, and thermal emission imaging from the Mars Odyssey orbiter does not reveal any hot spots on Mars. Hydrothermal systems can hardly be warmer than the room temperature at which production of methane is very low in terrestrial waters. Therefore a significant production of hydrothermal and magmatic methane is not very likely on Mars. The calculated average production of CH4 by cometary impacts is 2% of the methane loss. Production of methane by meteorites and interplanetary dust does not exceed 4% of the methane loss. Methane cannot originate from an extinct biosphere, as in the case of “natural gas” on Earth, given the exceedingly low limits on organic matter set by the Viking landers and the dry recent history which has been extremely hostile to the macroscopic life needed to generate the gas. Therefore, methanogenesis by living subterranean organisms is a plausible explanation for this discovery. Our estimates of the biomass and its production using the measured CH4 abundance show that the martian biota may be extremely scarce and Mars may be generally sterile except for some oases.}

Abstract = {{The nu(2)+2nu(3) combination band of (CH4)-C-12 near 7510 cm(-1) was
   studied with the recently introduced technique of cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy employing a cw-diode laser in a pulsed supersonic slit jet
   expansion and with Doppler-limited Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy at room temperature. nu(2)+2nu(3) is the strongest
   absorption band in the high-wave-number region of the N=2.5 icosad of
   methane. First assignments of the combination band are provided. The
   vibrational origin of nu(2)+2nu(3) at 7510.3378+/-0.0010 cm(-1), the
   integrated band strength G=(1.3+/-0.2)x10(-4) pm(2) and the vibrational
   transition moment parallel tomu(nu)parallel to=(1.0+/-0.1)x10(-3) D have
   been determined. The values represent benchmarks to test effective
   vibrational Hamiltonians and ab initio calculations for methane.
   Although an isolated band analysis was possible at low J-values, the
   influence of strong perturbations becomes evident at higher rotational
   excitation. The F-1-component of nu(2)+2nu(3) interacting by a strong
   Coriolis resonance with the IR-active F-2-component appears to be a
   dominant perturber.}},

abstract = {Modeling of the geometric albedo of Uranus in and near prominent methane absorption bands between 0.5 and 0.9 μm indicates that the visible atmosphere probably consists of a thin aerosol haze layer (τscat ≅ 0.3−0.5; ωH ≅ 0.95) above an optically thick, semi-infinite Rayleigh scattering atmosphere. A significant depletion of methane gas above the haze layer is indicated. The mixing ratio of methane in the lower atmosphere is consistent with a value of CH4/H2 ≅ 3 × 10−3, comparable to those derived for Jupiter and Saturn.}

Ne, N2, O2, Ar, CO, H2O, SO2, and CO2 were measured, and upper limits set for H2, COS, H2S, CH4, Kr, N2O, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8. Simulation studies have provided indirect evidence for sulfuric acid-like droplets and support the possibility of water vapor at altitudes of 42 and 24 km. The paper discusses the implications of these results for the origin, evolution, and present state of Venus' atmosphere.},
