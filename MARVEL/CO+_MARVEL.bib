Abstract = {We report an experimental investigation of the 0 - v `' progression
   bands of the First -Negative (B 2 I + - X 2 I + ) system of 12 C 16 O +
   . The ultraviolet wavelength emission spectrum of CO + was generated
   using an air-cooled stainless steel hollow-cathode discharge lamp filled
   with a mixture of CO 2 and Ne. The study includes four bands, i.e. 0-0,
   0-1, 0-2 and 0-3, observed in emission with a high-resolution
   Fourier-transform spectrometer in the 38 500-46 000 cm -1 region. In
   total, 541 ro-vibronic transitions have been measured with an absolute
   accuracy of 0.005-0.010 cm -1 . The experimental data were analyzed
   using the PGOPHER program, which resulted in a set of high accuracy
   molecular constants and ro-vibronic level positions for the X 2 I + , v
   = 0 - 3 and B 2 I + , v = 0 levels. The current values of the band
   origins have been compared with historical data, including the most
   recent results obtained by Ventura et al. (2020) and the discrepancies
   pointed out by the authors were explained.},

Title = {New analysis of the 12C16O+(B2E+-X2E+) system: Spin-orbit and

Abstract = {In the present work a new experimental and theoretical analysis of the
   B2E+ \& RARR; X2E+ system of the molecular ion 12C16O+ is performed. New
   transitions regarding the vibrational levels v ⠄ = 4 of the B2E+
   electronic state and the vibrational level v ⠄⠄ = 7 of the electronic
   state X2E+ have been recorded. For rationalising the experimental
   observations, molecular structure calculations were carried out and,
   from them, a detailed investigation about the fine structure of
   rotational levels of the X2E+ could be per-formed. For such, the
   spin-rotational constant, y, is characterised through the Ag \& BOTTOM;
   calculation, the per-pendicular component of the electronic g-tensor, in
   combination with Curl's relation. At equilibrium ge-ometry, the present
   Ag \& BOTTOM; is computed using the multireference configuration
   interaction wavefunction to be -2430 ppm in agreement with the
   experimental one {[} -2344 ppm]. The R-dependence of the g-tensor has
   been explored in order to estimate the theoretical yv ( v = 0 -7). In
   addition, the importance of the lowest 11 states in this kind of
   calculation is widely discussed. A comparison between experiment and
   theory is presented, validating our findings and the methodology
   employed in our analysis.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {In this article, a new study of the (CO)-C-12-O-16+ First Negative
   system (B-2 Sigma(+) -> X-2 Sigma(+)), is performed both theoretically
   and experimentally. From an experimental point of view, high-resolution
   Fourier transform spectroscopy in the ultraviolet region was used. On
   the theoretical side, ab initio electronic energies were calculated
   employing the state-averaged multiconfiguration self-consistent field
   (MCSCF) method, followed by the icMRCI/AV6Z level of theory with
   Davidson modification. Through these two analyses, theoretical and
   experimental, values for the spectroscopic constants, potential energy
   curves, and parameters concerning the transition are presented. The
   results, both theoretical and experimental, obtained in this work are
   compared with values obtained in previous works, pointing out certain
   discrepancies with more recent works and providing new and improved
   values for the band origins of this transition. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The A(2)Pi, state of (CO+)-C-12-O-16 has been reinvestigated using

   spectroscopy of the (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0) and (1, 1) bands of the

   0.005 cm(-1). The high temperature (900K) of the emission discharge
   inside the hollow-cathode lamp permitted monitoring of high rotational
   quantum levels in A(2)Pi(i)(nu = 0, 1) up to J=48.5. All these bands
   together with the X-2 Sigma(+) - X-2 Sigma(+)(10, 1) and (10, 2)
   transitions deriving from a complex, spin-orbit, spin-electronic and
   L-uncoupling A(2)Pi(nu = 0) similar to X-2 Sigma(+)(nu=10) interaction
   as well as the B-2 Sigma(+) - X-2 Sigma(+)(6, 10) frequency transitions
   from our previous study were taken into consideration. In total, 1849
   spectral lines were included in the comprehensive deperturbation
   analysis. This fit leads to a much improved description in terms of
   deperturbed molecular constants and interaction parameters compared to
   the previous studies of the same energy region in CO+. Moreover, the
   ro-vibronic term values of the A(2)Pi(i)(nu = 0) level and its perturber

Abstract = {The 1-0, 6-0 and 6-1 bands of the A(2)Pi(i) -> X-2 Sigma(+) system of
   (CO+)-C-13-O-16 and the 2-0 and 2-1 bands of the A(2)Pi(i) -> X-2
   Sigma(+) system of (CO+)-C-14-O-16 have been recorded at high resolution
   for the first time. The 0-2 and 5-0 bands of the A -> X system of
   (OO+)-O-12-O-16 have also been recorded at higher resolution than in
   previous work. The spectra were excited in an air-cooled hollow cathode
   discharge and photographed using a 2-m plane grating spectrograph. The
   spectral resolution and the Doppler-broadened line widths are both
   similar to 0.12 cm(-1), and the experimental measurement precision of
   resolved lines is similar to 0.02 cm(-1). The measured line positions,
   sometimes in combination with literature data on the B-2 Sigma(+) ->
   A(2)Pi(i); transition, have been employed in deperturbation analyses of
   level crossings in the near-degenerate A(0)similar to X(10) and
   A(5)similar to X(14) interactions in (CO+)-C-12-O-16, the A(1)similar to

   A(2)similar to X(12) interaction in (CO+)-C-14-O-16. No radial
   dependence of the electronic perturbation matrix elements H-SO(r) and
   H-RE(r) could be detected over the narrow range of r-centroids
   (1.477-1.501 angstrom), and the mean values of these parameters are H-SO
   = -49.06(15) cm(-1) and H-RE = 0.211(2). Using iteratively improved RKR
   potentials and FC-overlap integrals, the mean H-SO and H-RE were
   employed in least-squares analyses of A -> X literature data involving
   A(D) levels of the three isotopologues that are affected by interactions
   with one or two distant X(if) levels. The fitted parameters of the
   A(2)Pi(i), state (B-D, A(D), A(DDs) p(D), q(D)) exhibit D-dependences
   that are much smoother than those employing perturbed parameters
   determined in previous investigations. In addition, a significant
   electronic isotope effect has been characterized. The separations
   T-e(A)-T-e(X) of the minima of the A and X states of (CO+)-C-13-O-16 and
   (CO+)-C-14-O-16 are less than that of (CO+)-C-12-O-16 by 0.39 and 0.73

Abstract = {A millimeter/submillimeter direct absorption spectrometer has been
   constructed that employs velocity modulation to selectively detect
   molecular ions. The instrument consists of a phase-locked Gunn
   oscillator/Schottky diode multiplier source, a gas absorption cell, and
   an InSb hot-electron bolometer detector. The gas cell is a single-pass
   system with two ring-type discharge electrodes at either end, which are
   connected to an rf power supply. Modulation of the ac discharge at a
   rate of 50 kHz and phase-sensitive detection at 1f allows for selective
   observation of molecular ion signals and suppression of absorption from
   neutral species. The spectrometer can also be used in source-modulated
   mode, where the signal-to-noise ratio for signals generated in an ac
   plasma are significantly better than for dc discharges. Combining source
   modulation with the ac discharge for signal detection and velocity
   modulation for ion identification provides a powerful technique for
   molecular ion spectroscopy at millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths. This
   instrument has been used to measure the pure rotational spectra of CO+,
   HCO+, and SH+ with better precision than previous studies. (C) American

Abstract = {Conventional, high resolution molecular spectroscopy has been employed
   to record emission spectra of the first negative bands system in the
   (CO+)-C-12-O-16 molecule. Twenty two bands form the 0-v{''},1-v{''},
   2-v{''}, 3-v{''}, 4-v{''}, 5-v{''} progressions and 6-10 band were
   photographed in the 34000-46000 cm(-1) spectral region. The reduction of
   the spectrum for the individual bands has been performed via a nonlinear
   least-squares fit with the effective Hamiltonians of Brown et al. {[}J.
   Mol. Spectrosc. 74, 294 (1979)]. The final molecular constants for both
   the B(2)Sigma(+) (v = 0-6) and X(2)Sigma(+) (v = 0-10) states were
   obtained from global merge calculations of the present data of the B -->
   X system and previously obtained in our laboratory data for A --> X and
   B --> A systems in the CO+ molecule. Merged molecular parameters have
   been used in order to the determine the equilibrium constants for both
   considered states. The gamma(e) = 2.194(14) x 10(-2) cm(-1) and
   alpha(gammae) = -1.021(64) x 10(-4) cm(-1) constants for th B(2)Sigma(+)
   state were obtained for the first time. The RKR potentials have been
   calculated for both combining states, as well as Franck-Condon factor
   and r-centroids for the first negative system in the (CO)-C-12-O-16 (+)
   molecule. Furthermore, we report the value of the electronic isotopic
   shift Deltav(e) = -0.395 cm(-1) of the B --> X system in (CO)-C-13-O-16
   (+) , calculated on the basis the presents results and those obtained by
   us previously for the (CO)-C-13-O-16 (+) molecule.},

Abstract = {Six bands of the B(2)Sigma(+) --> X(2)Sigma(+) system in the
   (CO+)-C-12-O-16 molecule were photographed by conventional spectroscopic
   techniques under high resolution. The 4-7 band was reinvestigated and
   the 4-6, 4-8, 5-8, 5-9, and 6-10 bands were recorded and analysed for
   the first time. The rovibronic structure parameters of the individual
   bands were obtained from their wavenumber data via a nonlinear
   least-squares procedure fit. The effective Hamiltonians of Brown with
   direct matrix elements given by Amiot et al. {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc. 87

   constants B-upsilon, D-upsilon, and gamma(upsilon) for B(2)Sigma(+)
   (upsilon = 4-6) and for the X(2)Sigma(+) (upsilon = 6-10) states and six

Abstract = {In the emission spectrum of the CO+ ion new so-far unobserved 0-2, 1-3,
   and 2-1 bands and so-far unanalyzed 1-2 and 2-0 bands belonging to the
   Baldet-Johnson (B2SIGMA+-A2PI(i)) system have been identified and
   recorded by means of conventional spectroscopy. The individual analysis
   of the recorded bands and the merged analysis of the Baldet-Johnson
   system which is now extended to eight bands made it possible to
   considerably improve and extend the information on both the B2SIGMA+ and
   A2PI(i) excited states of the CO+ molecule. Especially, the information
   about equilibrium constants of the rovibronic structure and the
   potential curve parameters of both states have been improved and
   extended. Also a new quantitative classification of the relative band
   intensities of the now enlarged Baldet-Johnson system has been proposed.

Abstract = {The comet-tail (A (2)PI(i)-X (2)SIGMA+) system of the molecular ion
   (CO)-C-12-O-16+, excited in the cathode glow of a hollow-cathode
   discharge tube of special design, was photographed in the spectral
   region 3400-8500 angstrom.  Of the 17 observed bands with upsilon' = 0-8
   and upsilon{''} = 0-4, the rotational structure of 12 bands with
   upsilon' = 0-4 and 6 and upsilon{''} = 0-4 was analyzed.  An effective
   Hamiltonian was used to obtain the molecular constants of the individual
   bands from their wavenumber data and the constants for the A and X
   states were then determined by merging the molecular constants thus
   obtained by the method of correlated least-squares fit.  Recent

   the microwave spectra involving upsilon = 0, 1, and 2, of its ground
   state X, were reanalyzed using this effective Hamiltonian.  Finally a
   precise set of molecular constants for the X, A, and B states of
   (CO)-C-12-O-16+ is determined by the procedures referred to above.  The
   astrophysical importance of the spectra of CO+ is also briefly outlined.},
