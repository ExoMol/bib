abstract = {Molecular transitions provide natural frequency standards for spectroscopy, telecommunication, and astrophysics. The frequency accuracy is also crucial in various tests of fundamental physics. A comb-locked cavity ring-down spectrometer measured lamb dips of sixty-one $^{12}$C${16}$O transitions around 1.57 $\mu$m in the second overtone band. The positions were determined with an accuracy of a few kHz. A new set of rotational spectroscopic parameters was derived with 30 ground state combination difference for the ground vibrational state with a standard deviation of 4.5 kHz. It results in a refinement of the ro-vibrational spectroscopic constants for the v=3 vibrational state. These parameters allow the pure rotational line lists of the υ=0←0 and υ=3←3 in the 112 GHz – 3.89 THz regions.}

abstract = {The room temperature spectrum of the very weak third overtone band of carbon monoxide in natural isotopic abundance is recorded by cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) referenced to a frequency comb, between 8206 and 8465 cm−1. The sensitivity of the recordings (noise equivalent absorption on the order of αmin ∼ 5 × 10−12 cm−1) allowed for measuring lines with intensity as weak as 1 × 10−30 cm/molecule at a recording pressure limited to 10.0 Torr. The use of low pressure values (1.0 and 10.0 Torr) helped to minimize the impact of profile effects on the derived line positions and line intensities. The line profile analysis was performed using the speed dependent Nelkin-Ghatak model for the 10 Torr recordings while the Voigt profile was found sufficient to account for the line shapes recorded at 1.0 Torr. Overall, line parameters of 227 transitions are derived. The observed transitions belong to the 4-0 band of the $^{12}$C${16}$O, 13C16O, 12C18O and 12C17O isotopologues present in natural abundance in the sample and to the 5-1 hot band of $^{12}$C${16}$O. For a large part of the observations, line positions are reported with accuracy as good as 4 × 10−6 cm−1 (∼120 kHz). The self-induced line shift of the 4-0 band is reported for the first time from the position values at 1 and 10 Torr. Using literature values of the 1-0, 2-0 and 3-0 bands, the vibrational dependence of the self-induced pressure shift in CO is discussed. The experimental values of the $^{12}$C${16}$O v = 4 energy levels J < 26 are reproduced with a standard deviation of 2.5 × 10−6 cm−1 (75 kHz). The intensities of the $^{12}$C${16}$O lines reported with an accuracy better than 1% show an overall good agreement with literature values in particular with those included in the HITRAN database.}

abstract = {Frequency-based cavity mode-dispersion spectroscopy (CMDS), previously applied for Doppler-limited molecular spectroscopy, is now employed for the first time for saturation spectroscopy. Comparison with two intensity-based, cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy techniques, i.e. cavity mode-width spectroscopy (CMWS) and the well-established cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), shows the predominance of the CMDS. The method enables measurements in broader pressure range and shows high immunity of the Lamb dip position to the incomplete model of saturated cavity mode shape. Frequencies of transitions from the second overtone of CO are determined with standard uncertainty below 500 Hz which corresponds to relative uncertainty below 3 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}12.

They deliver high sensitivity, high frequency resolution and precision in a broad spectral range. Due to these features, the field has burgeoned in recent years. In this work we constructed an OFC-based cavity-enhanced Fourier-transform spectrometer in the near-infrared region and used it for a line-shape study of rovibrational transitions of CO perturbed by Ar. The highly sensitive measurements spanned the wavenumber range from 6270 cm−1 to 6410 cm−1, which covered both P and R branch of the second overtone band of CO. The spectrometer delivers high-resolution surpassing the Fourier-transform resolution limit determined by interferogram length, successfully removing ringing and broadening effects caused by instrumental line shape function. The instrumental-line-shape-free method and high signal-to-noise ratio in the measurement allowed us to observe collisional effects beyond those described by the Voigt profile. We retrieved collisional line-shape parameters by fitting the speed-dependent Voigt profile and found good agreement with the values given by precise cavity ring-down spectroscopy measurements that used a continuous-wave laser referenced to a stabilized OFC. The results demonstrate that OFC-based cavity-enhanced Fourier-transform spectroscopy is a strong tool for accurate line-shape studies that will be crucial for future spectral databases.}",

Air-broadened half-width and air-shift coefficients, their temperature dependences, line mixing via off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients for CO-air collision systems, and quadratic speed dependence parameters were measured for 13C16O and 12C18O transitions. In both the fittings, two low-pressure room-temperature spectra of a high purity natural sample of CO recorded with the Kitt Peak FTS were included to retrieve the positions and intensities of $^{12}$C${16}$O transitions. All other spectra in the fittings were obtained with either 13C-enriched or 18O-enriched samples using the JPL Bruker IFS-125HR FTS. Four absorption cells with path lengths between 0.5131(5) and 20.38(2) cm were used to record the data. The cells are temperature controlled, except for the shortest cell. Positions and intensities for the 1â†0 band transitions were determined from the retrieved ro-vibrational constants (G, B, D and H), band intensity and Herman-Wallis parameters by applying the theoretical quantum mechanical expressions. The band strengths of $^{12}$C${16}$O, 12C18O and 13C18O are very close (âˆ¼0.3%) to HITRAN2012 values but for 13C16O the band strength is âˆ¼4.8% larger than the HITRAN2012 and 2.6% larger than the HITRAN2016 value.}

It is shown that it is highly improbable that a mechanical device used to rotate a diffraction grating can be constructed with sufficient precision so that the line-frequency error will be determined by the optical information observable in the near infrared spectrum. By making use of the echelle spectrograph 67 lines of the 001--000 absorption band of HCN have been measured. Almost 400 lines from five N2O absorption bands arising from the ground state of the molecule have been measured. In addition, 11 lines from the 1--0 fundamental band of CO have been measured in order to determine $\nu$0 for this band. In all cases only band lines have been measured which appear to be free of blends. The molecular constants of the above bands have been determined by making use of the combination relationships applying least-squares methods to the data. The line frequencies have then been calculated to four decimal places and presented in tables. The tables contain over 600 line frequencies. We believe the calculated line frequencies (lines free of blends) have an absolute accuracy of about 1 part in 5{\texttimes}106 and a relative accuracy referring to lines within a given band somewhat greater.},

a classical approach was applied to calculate the half-width coefficients of transitions
in the 2â†0 band for carbon monoxide broadened by H2 and for pure CO. The classical

calculated from an experimentally determined potential energy function from Coxon & Hajigeorgiou.
A direct-fit method that simultaneously fits all the reliable experimental rovibrational
matrix elements has been used to construct the dipole moment function near equilibrium
internuclear distance. In order to extend the amount and quality of input experimental
parameters, new Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy experiments were carried out to enable
measurements of the lines in the 4-0 band with low uncertainty as well as the first
measurements of lines in the 6-0 band. A new high-level ab initio DMF, derived from
a finite field approach has been calculated to cover internuclear distances far from
equilibrium. Accurate partition sums have been derived for temperatures up to 9000Â K.
In addition to air- and self-induced broadening and shift parameters, those induced
by CO2 and H2 are now provided for planetary applications. A complete set of broadening
and shift parameters was calculated based on sophisticated extrapolation of high-quality
measured data. The line lists, which follow HITRAN formalism, are provided as supplementary material.},

for the first overtone band transitions of $^{12}$C${16}$O at room temperature have been
determined through analysis of nine high-resolution (0.0055cmâˆ’1) absorption spectra.
These spectra were recorded using the 1-m Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at
the McMath-Pierce facility of the National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak, Arizona.
Because of the short path length of the sample cell (10.0cm), the volume mixing
ratios of CO in hydrogen were relatively high, âˆ¼18â€“22%, to achieve measurable absorption.
These large volume-mixing ratios necessitated the simultaneous determination of
the CO self-broadening and self-shift coefficients along with the hydrogen-broadening
and hydrogen-induced shift coefficients. We have determined these coefficients
at room temperature, along with line positions and absolute intensities, for the
P(27) through R(27) $^{12}$C${16}$O 2-0 transitions by fitting the entire spectral interval
from 4130 to 4345cmâˆ’1 in all nine spectra simultaneously using our multispectrum
nonlinear least-squares procedure. Our intensity measurements are consistently
low (1â€“6%) compared with the HITRAN values but the majority of the intensities
are within 4% of the HITRAN values. The values of self-broadening coefficients
vary from 0.0452 to 0.0862cmâˆ’1atmâˆ’1 at 296K and those of hydrogen-broadening
coefficient range between 0.0475 and 0.0795cmâˆ’1atmâˆ’1 at 296K. All of our measured
self- and hydrogen-shift coefficients are negative and range from âˆ’0.002 to âˆ’0.008cmâˆ’1atmâˆ’1.
With the pressure and path length used in our study we did not find evidence of
significant line mixing in either the self- or hydrogen-broadened spectra. This
study represents the first high-resolution experimental determination of hydrogen-induced
pressure broadening and pressure-shift coefficients in the 2-0 band of $^{12}$C${16}$O at

abstract = {Dipole moment matrix elements have been computed for the five most
abundant isotopes of CO. The wave functions utilized were obtained from a direct
solution of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation with an accurate RKR potential. The dipole
moment function, in the form of a PadÃ© approximant, was chosen to reproduce the
experimental measurements near equilibrium, to have the proper united and separated
atom limits, and to have the correct long-range asymptotic functional dependence
on internuclear separation. Because of the large number of transitions involved,
and to facilitate applications, the squares of the dipole moment matrix elements
were fitted by a least-squares procedure to polynomials in v and J. Predictions
for the 5-0 and 6-0 rotationless matrix elements and Herman-Wallis coefficients
are given, and their dependence on the isotopic reduced mass is discussed. For
the pure rotational band, v = vâ€² = 0, explicit Einstein A values and transition
frequencies were calculated for the three most abundant isotopes for J up to 55.
The corresponding dipole moment matrix elements were also fitted to simple polynomials
in m and the dependence of the coefficients on the reduced mass given. The present
results incorporate the most accurate and extensive intensity measurements and
theoretical dipole moment function data for any heteronuclear diatomic molecule.
In view of this, because of the importance of the CO laser, the accuracy of the
spectral frequencies, and the ubiquity of the CO molecule, it is reasonable to
expect that some of these lines, in particular, in the fundamental band of $^{12}$C${16}$O,
can serve as laboratory standards for intensity measurements.},
