Abstract = {{The observed ro-vibrational spectral lines of the simplest polyatomic
   molecule, H-3(+), serve as the bench-mark to test the most rigorous ab
   initio theory of intra-molecular dynamics. The ground state equilibrium
   structure of H-3(+) is an equilateral triangle, but near the energies
   of similar to 9913 cm(-1), the so called barrier to linearity, it
   begins to sample linear configurations for which theoretical
   calculations are challenging because of the singularity of the
   Hamiltonian. We present here a continuation of the spectroscopy of
   H-3(+) above the barrier to linearity using a Ti:sapphire laser based
   high sensitivity spectrometer which all owed us to observe the spectrum
   with near shot-noise limited sensitivity. 121 new lines have been
   recorded from the near infrared 10300 cm(-1)-13700 cm(-1) entering the
   visible region bringing the total number of transitions above 10000
   cm(-1) to 143. The observed spectrum is compared with theoretical
   predictions. The remaining discrepancies mostly due to vibrational and
   rotational non-adiabatic effects are discussed. }}}

Pages = {10890-10899},
Abstract = {{The first H-3(+) transitions above the barrier to linearity have been
   observed in absorption in the near infrared using a highly sensitive
   dual-beam, double-modulation technique with bidirectional optical
   multipassing. A total of 22 rovibrational transitions of H-3(+) have
   been detected and assigned to the fourth and fifth overtone and
   combination bands (5nu(2)(1), 5nu(2)(5), 2nu(1)+2nu(2)(2),
   3nu(1)+nu(2)(1), nu(1)+4nu(2)(2), 2nu(1)+3nu(2)(1), and 6nu(2)(2)).
   These transitions, which are more than 4600 times weaker than the
   fundamental band, probe energy levels above 10 000 cm(-1), the regime
   in which H-3(+) has enough energy to sample linear configurations.
   Experimentally determined energy levels above the barrier to linearity
   provide a critical test of ab initio calculations in this challenging
   regime. The comparison between experimental energy levels and
   theoretical energy levels from ab initio calculations in which the
   adiabatic and relativistic corrections are incorporated reveals the
   extent of higher-order effects such as nonadiabatic and radiative
   corrections. We compare our results with several recent theoretical
   calculations. }}}

Abstract = {{We have performed chemical probing spectroscopy of H-3(+) ions trapped
   in a cryogenic 22-pole ion trap. The ions were buffer gas cooled to
   similar to 55 K by collisions with helium and argon. Excitation to
   states above the barrier to linearity was achieved by a Ti: sapphire
   laser operated between 11 300 and 13 300 cm(-1). Subsequent collisions
   of the excited H-3(+) ions with argon lead to the formation of ArH+
   ions that were detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer with high
   sensitivity. We report the observation of 17 previously unobserved
   transitions to states above the barrier to linearity. Comparison to
   theoretical calculations suggests that the transition strengths of some
   of these lines are more than five orders of magnitude smaller than
   those of the fundamental band, which renders them - to the best of our
   knowledge - the weakest H-3(+) transitions observed to date. }}}

abstract = "Abstract The H 3 + molecular ion has served as a long-standing benchmark for state-of-the-art ab initio calculations of molecular potentials and variational calculations of rovibrational energy levels. However, the accuracy of such calculations would not have been confirmed if not for the wealth of spectroscopic data that has been made available for this molecule. Recently, a new high-precision ion spectroscopy technique was demonstrated by Hodges et al., which led to the first highly accurate and precise (∼MHz) H 3 + transition frequencies. As an extension of this work, we present ten additional R-branch transitions measured to similar precision as a next step toward the ultimate goal of producing a comprehensive high-precision survey of this molecule, from which rovibrational energy levels can be calculated.
