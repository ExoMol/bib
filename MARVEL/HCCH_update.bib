    abstract = "{We demonstrate massively parallel spectroscopic measurements of 12C2H2 using an optical frequency comb. This allows for the rapid and simultaneous estimation of self-broadening and self-shifting of more than 50 optical transitions between 1512 and 1538Â nm. The use of a temperature-controlled sealed gas cell allows us to measure both pressure- and temperature-mediated broadening and shifting. We present the results for the pressure-mediated self-broadening and self-shifting coefficients for 59 optical lines that make up the v1 + v3 combination band and a selection of hot bands. Our ability to measure the broadening of numerous transitions allows for the confirmation of prior work that shows that there is no measurable vibrational dependence across all acetylene bands, despite the strong dependence of the broadening coefficient on the rotational number. We also present an extensive measurement of the temperature dependence of the self-broadening for each of these 59 lines. This work shows the revolutionary power afforded by the frequency combs for rapid generation of large datasets related to thermodynamic variations of the key spectroscopic parameters of important gases.}",
