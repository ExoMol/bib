    abstract = "{We demonstrate massively parallel spectroscopic measurements of 12C2H2 using an optical frequency comb. This allows for the rapid and simultaneous estimation of self-broadening and self-shifting of more than 50 optical transitions between 1512 and 1538 nm. The use of a temperature-controlled sealed gas cell allows us to measure both pressure- and temperature-mediated broadening and shifting. We present the results for the pressure-mediated self-broadening and self-shifting coefficients for 59 optical lines that make up the v1 + v3 combination band and a selection of hot bands. Our ability to measure the broadening of numerous transitions allows for the confirmation of prior work that shows that there is no measurable vibrational dependence across all acetylene bands, despite the strong dependence of the broadening coefficient on the rotational number. We also present an extensive measurement of the temperature dependence of the self-broadening for each of these 59 lines. This work shows the revolutionary power afforded by the frequency combs for rapid generation of large datasets related to thermodynamic variations of the key spectroscopic parameters of important gases.}",

abstract = {The investigation of the 3.8 µm spectral region of acetylene 12C2H2 main isotopologue has been completed from spectra recorded with Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) using high optical path length. This work is the second of a series dedicated to the ΔP = 4 spectral region. In the first paper of the series (JQSRT 2023;295:108413) 14 bands of 12C2H2 were studied in the beginning of the region. In the present work the whole ΔP = 4 spectral region was investigated. 52 newly observed vibrational bands have been studied as well as the 5 intense bands present in the HITRAN and GEISA databases. The band centers and the upper level spectroscopic constants were retrieved for all bands. The comparison with the data from HITRAN and GEISA databases revealed important deviations from the measurements due to wrong extrapolations (especially line positions). The effective dipole moment operator parameters describing intensities of all transitions observed in the ΔP = 4 spectra region were refined. A complete list of calculated line parameters for 7515 transitions has been generated for 71 bands between 2389 cm−1 and 2890 cm−1.}

Abstract = {Lamb dips of twenty lines in the P, Q, and R branches of the ?(1) + ?(3)
   + ?(1)(4) vibrational band of (C2H2)-C-12, in the spectral window of
   7125-7230 cm(-1), have been measured using an upgraded comb-calibrated
   frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectrometer, designed for
   extensive sub-Doppler measurements. Due to the large number of carefully
   executed Lamb-dip experiments, and to the extrapolation of absolute
   frequencies to zero pressure in each case, the combined average
   uncertainty of the measured line-center positions is 15 kHz (5 x 10(-7)
   cm(-1)) with a 2-s confidence level. Selection of the twenty lines was
   based on the theory of spectroscopic networks (SN), ensuring that a
   large number of transitions, measured previously by
   precision-spectroscopy investigations, could be connected to the para
   and ortho principal components of the SN of (C2H2)-C-12. The assembled
   SN contains 331 highly precise transitions, 119 and 121 of which are in
   the ortho and para principal components, respectively, while the rest
   remain in floating components. The para- and ortho-(C2H2)-C-12
   energy-level lists, determined during the present study, contain 82 and
   80 entries, respectively, with an accuracy similar to that of the lines.
   Based on the newly assembled lists of para- and ortho-(C2H2)-C-12
   empirical energy levels, a line list, called TenkHz, has been generated.
   The TenkHz line list contains 282 entries in the spectral range of
   5898.97-7258.87 cm(-1); thus far, only 149 of them have been measured
   directly via precision spectroscopy. The TenkHz line list includes 35
   intense lines that are missing in the HITRAN2020 database.},
