Title = {{Indirect Rotational Spectroscopy of HCO+}},
Journal =JPCA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {117},
Number = {39},
Pages = {10034-10040},
Abstract = {Spectroscopy of the nu(1) band of the astrophysically relevant ion HCO+
   is performed with an optical parametric oscillator calibrated with an
   optical frequency comb. The sub-MHz accuracy of this technique was
   confirmed by performing a combination differences analysis with the
   acquired rovibrational data and comparing the results to known ground
   state rotational transitions. A similar combination differences analysis
   was performed from the same data set to calculate the previously
   unobserved rotational spectrum of the nu(1) vibrationally excited state
   with precision sufficient for astronomical detection. Initial results of
   cavity enhanced sub-Doppler spectroscopy are also presented and hold
   promise for further improving the accuracy and precision in the near
   future.},

Title = {PRECISE THz MEASUREMENTS OF HCO+, N2H+, AND CF+ FOR ASTROPHYSICAL
   OBSERVATIONS},
Journal = ApJSS,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {203},
Abstract = {Ground-state rotational spectra of HCO+, N2H+, and CF+ (both C-12- and
   C-13- containing isotopologues) have been recorded in the 1.0-1.6 THz
   frequency range. Present measurements allowed us to improve the
   spectroscopic parameters, which in turn enabled the prediction of
   rotational transitions up to 2.0-2.5 THz with good accuracy. We
   therefore consider the present results to be of great value in view of
   the extended spectral coverage made available by the Herschel Space
   Observatory, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, and the
   Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Furthermore, we re- investigated the
   ground-state rotational spectrum of N2H+ in the 93-750 GHz frequency
   range, thus addressing the open issue of the frequency of the J = 1 <- 0
   transition as well as resolving the hyperfine structure of the J = 1 <-
   J transitions with J = 1, 2, and 3 for the first time.},

Title = {{Rotational spectrum of the formyl cation, HCO+, to 1.2 THz}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {662},
Pages = {771-778},
Abstract = {A variety of high-quality spectroscopic studies have contributed to
   knowledge of the formyl cation, HCO+, and its rare isotopologues, but
   technical limitations have previously limited precise determinations of
   the far-infrared, or terahertz spectrum. This study extends the
   microwave, millimeter, and submillimeter spectroscopy of HCO+ into the
   terahertz range. The resulting measurements and predictions are of
   sufficient coverage to adequately address astrophysical questions about
   this species using the Herschel Space Observatory or the Atacama Large
   Millimeter Array.},
