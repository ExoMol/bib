This charge-transfer transition terminates on a weakly bound valence state, giving a highly congested spectrum with fine violet-degraded band structure barely perceivable on a pseudocontinuous background. The superior signal-to-noise capabilities of the array detector permit a great improvement in the precision and number of measured bandheads, as compared with previous results obtained from photographically recorded spectra. The new data span a larger range of vibrational levels in the lower state and lead to a change in the previous ν″ numbering by −3 units. Both states can now be located precisely on the absolute energy axis through least-squares fits in which the lower state energy is represented as a near-dissociation expansion.

	abstract = {Equivalent width measurements were made on rotational lines in six vibrational bands in the B–X system of I2. All measurements were made photoelectrically. Calculations of the Doppler, natural, and collisional widths show the Doppler width to be 340 times larger than the combined natural and collisional width at 22°C. Measurement of the equivalent width at several path lengths for each line confirmed a pure Doppler curve of growth for the lines. From known spectroscopic data the line strengths gave a value for the square of the electronic contribution to the transition moment, and for the value of the total Einstein spontaneous emission rate from each υ′ to all υ″ with nonzero Franck–Condon factors. A comparison of these purely radiative decay rates with total decay rates measured by Chutjian, Link, and Brewer and by Davis and Grimes shows the presence of a significant amount of spontaneous predissociation of the B state to ground-state P3/22 iodine atoms. In the absence of collisions approximately 66\% of the molecules which enter the B state predissociate, while only 34\% radiate to the X state. In the presence of collisions, at 0.238-torr I2 pressure, approximately 20\% spontaneously predissociate, 10\% radiate to the X state, and 70\% leave the B state by a process or processes which are nonradiative and collision dependent. Measurements were also carried out on the 25–0 band in the presence of a 15-{kG} magnetic field. No change in the equivalent width was observed in the presence of the field, indicating that the coupling to the repulsive state causing magnetically induced predissociation is insufficient to change the f value of the rotational transition.},

The fluorescence intensity varied quasi-continously when the laser wavelength was scanned from 3950 to 4500 Å. Over 40 resonances at the frequency of one-photon transitions originating from the same two atomic iodine levels were observed in the fluorescence spectrum as well as in the photoionization spectrum. The intensity of both the fluorescence and the photoionization was found to vary quadratically with the laser power. The excited iodine atoms are formed by a coherent two-photon transition in molecular iodine followed by saturated photodissociation.},

	abstract = {Resonance Raman scattering from a homonuclear diatomic molecule is considered in detail. For convenience, the scattering may be classified into three excitation frequency regions—off-resonance Raman scattering for incident energies well away from resonance with any allowed transitions, discrete resonance Raman scattering for excitation near or in resonance with discrete transitions, and continuum resonance Raman scattering for excitation resonant with continuum transitions, e.g., excitation above a dissociation limit or into a repulsive electronic state. It is shown that the many differences in scattering properties in these three excitation frequency regions may be accounted for by expressions derived from simple perturbation theory. Scattering experiments from molecular iodine are presented which test and verify the general scattering theories. Spectral measurements, time decay measurements, and pressure broadening measurements were made on I2 in the discrete resonance Raman scattering region; and spectral measurements at several excitation frequencies were made in the continuum resonance Raman scattering region. In each case calculations based on general theories correctly describe the experimental data.},

At the 0.08 cm−1 resolution of the probe laser, rotational congestion near the band origins necessitates analysis by a nonlinear least-squares contour simulation method. Subsequent correlated fits of the band-by-band results are combined with other results to produce global constants valid for υ′=0–86, υ″=0–32.},

              hyperfine structure, which correspond to emission transitions of the B – X band in the range of 1053 – 1068 nm. The frequencies are measured by using a femtosecond optical frequency synthesiser based on a Ti:sapphire laser. The hyperfine structure is resolved by the method of three-level laser spectroscopy. The frequency-doubled cw Nd : {YAG} laser is used as an excitation radiation source, and the probe radiation in the range of 1050 – 1070 nm is generated by an external-cavity diode laser. The frequencies of both lasers are simultaneously locked to those of two adjacent hyperfine structure components of iodine lines, which have a common upper level. Correspondingly, the frequency of the Nd : {YAG} laser is locked to the frequency of the absorption transition component, and the diode laser frequency – to the frequency of the emission transition component. The radiation frequency of the diode laser ‘locked’ in this way is measured. Frequencies of 18 hyperfine structure components for six emission lines corresponding to the bands (32 – 54) and (32 – 53) are measured. The relative uncertainty of the measurement is 8 × 10

The laser self-tunes with time, interpreted as due to thermal effects. The laser can also be tuned by varying its operating current and voltage. These properties permit one to quickly and easily record absorption spectral segments spanning ranges of 1–6cm−1, with high quantitative reliability, resolution, and accuracy. As examples, spectra of I2 are recorded in the 650nm region as a function of pressure for several {RLP} wavelengths and are used to estimate the strength of the underlying continuum (due to A←X absorption) with relative standard error less than 1\%. Similarly, measurements of the integrated line absorption on selected lines in the B←X transition yield estimates of the electronic transition strength with unprecedented precision.},

From the shape of the spectrum the 1u (1Π) potential curve behaves as r−9 in the region of strong absorption. The A[1u(3Π)]← X absorption is found to be a factor of 2 stronger than previous estimates with a peak extinction of 41 liter mole−1 · cm−1 at 6730 Å. Earlier indications of a linear dependence of the dipole strength on r centroid for the B [O+u(3Π)]↔ X system are supported in this study.

	abstract = {Equivalent width measurements were made on rotational lines in six vibrational bands in the B–X system of I2. All measurements were made photoelectrically. Calculations of the Doppler, natural, and collisional widths show the Doppler width to be 340 times larger than the combined natural and collisional width at 22°C. Measurement of the equivalent width at several path lengths for each line confirmed a pure Doppler curve of growth for the lines. From known spectroscopic data the line strengths gave a value for the square of the electronic contribution to the transition moment, and for the value of the total Einstein spontaneous emission rate from each υ′ to all υ″ with nonzero Franck–Condon factors. A comparison of these purely radiative decay rates with total decay rates measured by Chutjian, Link, and Brewer and by Davis and Grimes shows the presence of a significant amount of spontaneous predissociation of the B state to ground-state P3/22 iodine atoms. In the absence of collisions approximately 66\% of the molecules which enter the B state predissociate, while only 34\% radiate to the X state. In the presence of collisions, at 0.238-torr I2 pressure, approximately 20\% spontaneously predissociate, 10\% radiate to the X state, and 70\% leave the B state by a process or processes which are nonradiative and collision dependent. Measurements were also carried out on the 25–0 band in the presence of a 15-{kG} magnetic field. No change in the equivalent width was observed in the presence of the field, indicating that the coupling to the repulsive state causing magnetically induced predissociation is insufficient to change the f value of the rotational transition.},

	abstract = {In an earlier paper on the fine structures of the visible lines in the arc spectra of bromine and iodine an attempt was made to estimate the nuclear spin of iodine, and a tentative value of 9/2 was proposed. The iodine arc lines were excited by a high frequency electrodeless discharge in pure iodine vapour and examined with a silvered Fabry-perot interferometer. The fine structures in the arc lines are small, and as the patterns are highly complex and the individual components not very sharp, interpretation was difficult. It was concluded with certainty that the nuclear spin was at least equal to 5/2, but one line in particular suggested a value of 9/2. This was indefinite, and in view of the uncertainty a thorough examination of both the arc and spark spectra of iodine has been undertaken. A preliminary notice has already appeared. The first spark spectrum can be more easily studied than the arc spectrum, since the structure are on a very much bigger scale and more complete resolution can be attained. The present work is concerned with the spark lines excited in a hollow cathode discharge. Fine structures in iodine spark lines were first recorded long ago by Wood and Kimura who excited the lines in a Geissler tube and examined them with a transmission echelon. Murakawa attempted to analyse the fine structure data, but as the source and instrument employed by Wood and Kimura were not able to give the high resolution attained here, the deductions made from these data, although generally correct, are uncertain and require further examination; for many of the line structures are much more complex than as reported by these earlier observers.},

Conversion efficiency of 0.14\% with a maximum output power of 3 {mW} is achieved. Single-pass gain is observed to be 3±1\% for the strongest transition. Thresholds of 100 {mW} and 1 W are observed for single-longitudinal-mode and multimode pumping, respectively.

The interference effect between the parallel γ1u(3P2)–c1g and perpendicular δ2u(3P2)–c1g transitions was used to derive the ratio of their electronic transition moments, (μ{\textbar}{\textbar}e/μ⊥e) ∼ 5.5.},

	abstract = {Autosensibilisations are essentially more frequent than hitherto was assumed. They, in the main, can be led back to 3 basic mechanisms: 1. Autosensibilisations by determination of the antibodies, where no immunotolerance was present, 2. fraction of the immunotolerance by antibodies (e. g. due to cross-reactions or adjuvant effects), 3. fraction of the immunotolerance by primary changes of immunocompetent cells (e. g. lymphoproliferation diseases). Even the natural immunotolerance is possibly maintained by enhancement effects of blocking autoantibodies. Pathogenic effects (auto-immune diseases) are above all to be expected, if the autoantibodies or by endogenic substances sensibilised T-lymphocytes may react with the antigen and these immune reactions lead to lesions of cells or other structures. Finally for the progression is also necessary the persistence and the autonomisation of the autosensibilisation. Finally is discussed in which range the criteria for the diagnostics of an auto-immune disease derived by Milgrom and Witebsky from the animal experiment may be transposed to the clinic.},

These spectra were also calculated numerically applying second-order perturbation theory. In contrast to earlier publications on this subject, special emphasis was put on obtaining highly reliable polarized and depolarized spectra. The variations of the spectral band shapes and depolarization ratios obtained at different excitation wavelengths could be explained by means of the specific contributions of the two excited electronic states [Formula: see text] and

	abstract = {Absorption cells filled with diatomic iodine are frequently employed as wavelength reference for high-precision stellar radial velocity determination due their long-term stability and low cost. Despite their wide-spread usage in the community, there is little documentation on how to determine the ideal operating temperature of an individual cell. We have developed a new approach to measuring the effective molecular temperature inside a gas absorption cell and searching for effects detrimental to a high precision wavelength reference, utilizing the Boltzmann distribution of relative line depths within absorption bands of single vibrational transitions. With a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer, we took a series of 632 spectra at temperatures between 23\{{\textbackslash}deg\}C and 66\{{\textbackslash}deg\}C. These spectra provide a sufficient basis to test the algorithm and demonstrate the stability and repeatability of the temperature determination via molecular lines on a single iodine absorption cell. The achievable radial velocity precision is found to be independent of the cell temperature and a detailed analysis shows a wavelength dependency, which originates in the resolving power of the spectrometer in use and the signal-to-noise ratio. Two effects were found to cause apparent absolute shifts in radial velocity, a temperature-induced shift of the order of 1 m/s/K and a more significant effect resulting in abrupt jumps of 50 m/s is determined to be caused by the temperature crossing the dew point of the molecular iodine.},

This approach is superior to the widely used procedure of determining potential points by some inversion procedure and fitting them to the inverse-power form, in that the fit is directly sensitive to the uncertainties in the experimental quantities, and that the parameter uncertainties due to interparameter correlation are greatly reduced. Moreover, the new method gives direct estimates of the number, energies, and other properties of unobserved levels lying above those being fitted. Improved results, including potential parameters up to C10, are presented for the B(3Π+0u) state of I2.},

	abstract = {The fluorescence excited in iodine by the green emission line of mercury, in the presence of foreign gases, has been examined by high-resolution photoelectric photometry. Cross sections for quenching, vibrational, and rotational energy transfer for the v′ = 25, J′ = 34 level of the B 3Π0u+ state of iodine have been obtained, for collisions with 3He, 4He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, H2, O2, {CO}2, {SO}2, {CH}3Cl, and {NH}3. Emission bands have been rotationally analyzed to yield partial total cross sections for the inelastic processes. These have been corrected for multiple scattering by a computer simulation procedure.
            The correlation of quenching efficiency with the mass and polarizability of the collision partner, found by Brown for the quenching of the v′ = 15 level of iodine, holds for the v′ = 25 level as well. There is no contribution to quenching efficiency from a permanent electric dipole moment. The data suggest that a complex set of interactions, including electrostatic polarization, spin—orbit forces, and specific chemical effects, are responsible for quenching, indicating a multiplicity of repulsive states contributing to the induced predissociation process. The vibrational energy-transfer efficiency is maximum when the mean collision time equals the period of oscillation of the molecule, which corresponds to a collision reduced mass ≃40 for T = 370°K, v′ = 25 of I2; vibrational transfer is largely independent of the internal structure of the collision partner. The efficiency of pure rotational energy transfer (Δv′ = 0) shows a similar smooth dependence on reduced mass of the collision system, with the exception of the molecules {SO}2, {CO}2, and {CH}3Cl, which are more efficient. Quantitative measurements have been made on partial components of total inelastic cross sections for ΔJ′ up to ±20 angular momentum units, with evidence for a total spread of ΔJ′ up to 30 or 40. The width of the distribution of partial cross section components decreases in the order Δv′=+2\&gt;−2≳+1\&gt;−1≫0; also, the ΔJ′ distribution is broader for collisions with heavier particles.},

All presently available high precision measurements on the B-X spectrum of the I-2 molecule in the visible were introduced into a model based on molecular potentials for the two electronic states involved, the transition frequencies being the differences of the energy eigenvalues for the rovibrational levels in those potentials. This approach allows, depending on the quality of the input data, a prediction of iodine lines with a 2sigma uncertainty of less than 30 {MHz} from 514 nm to 815 nm of most bands in that range. In the range between 526 nm to 667 nm, where highly precise systematic measurements exist, a smaller 2sigma uncertainty of 3 {MHz} is achieved. Moreover, a precise local model description of selected bands of the B-X spectrum has been derived from high precision measurements of iodine lines in the near infrared between 778 nm and 815 nm. This approach by using a Dunham parameter description allows to predict lines of these bands with a 1sigma uncertainty of less than 200 {kHz}. All this information including the systematically studied hyperfine structure can be combined in a computer program for predicting the details of the iodine B-X spectrum with high reliability, serving as a convenient tool in spectroscopic calibration tasks.},

	abstract = {(1) Previous estimates of the vertical energies of the valence-shell states of the iodine molecule are revised in the light of newer information. Correspondingly, a complete set of estimated potential curves is drawn for those valence-shell states which dissociate into ground-configuration atoms. In the light of this set of curves, conclusions in several recent papers are reviewed and in some cases revised. {LeRoy}'s 0g+ excited state is reconsidered. Predissociations of the 2431, Π30+u(B) state are discussed. It is definitely concluded that the state mainly responsible for magnetic predissociation is the corresponding Π30−u state and not a Σ3u+(0−) state. It is, however, possible that a ∑3u+(0−) state, probably that of the 1441 configuration, makes some contribution to the magnetic predissociation near υ = 10. Spontaneous predissociation and collision-induced predissociation are also discussed. (2) Previous calculations for the estimation of the wavefunctions, relative energies, and transition probabilities from the normal state 2440, 1Σg+(X), of the several states of the 2431 configuration, are revised in the light of newer evidence. It is concluded that of the fairly strong visible absorption, perhaps 20\% is due to the transition 1Πu ← X, the rest being 3Π0+u ← X and a little 3Π1u ← X. It is concluded that the 3Π0+u ← X transition moment results largely from case c mixing of 2431, 3Π0+g into X and relatively little directly from the mixing of 1441, 1Σu+ into 3Π0+u, but that a cross term arising from the joint effect of these two admixtures is also important. (3) Contrary to some writers, the conclusion that the intense uv room temperature absorption bands peaking at about 1825 Å (part of the Cordes bands) belong to the transition 1441, 1Σu+ ← X(D ← X) of the {VN} type, is strongly reaffirmed. The corresponding 1441, 3Σu+(1u) transition is identified with the weak I2 continuous absorption peaking near 2700 Å. Possible minor overlapping contributions from other weakly allowed transitions are discussed. The extension of the D ← X bands to longer wavelengths in high-temperature absorption is reviewed. An equation given by Wieland, aside from some uncertainty in the vibrational numbering, accurately describes the vibrational pattern of the D levels. The high-temperature absorption bands with low-frequency edges at λ 3427 and λ 3263 (Skorko bands) are, respectively, attributed to the transitions 1432, 3Π2g ← 2431, 3Π2u and 1432, 3Π1g ← 2431, 3Π1u which theoretically should be intrinsically intense like the D ← X bands. (4) Starting from semiclassical considerations in an accompanying paper on the role of kinetic energy in the Franck–Condon theory, and taking into account various experimental observations, it is concluded that the uv {McLennan} bands which culminate in a relatively intense series of fluctuations at about λ3250 are a part of the fluorescence spectrum resulting from excitation into vibrational levels of the D state; the resonance series at higher frequencies belongs to the same fluorescence spectrum (“primary fluorescence spectrum”). Other {McLennan} bands at longer wavelengths are attributed to transitions down to repulsive curves from other initial electronic states produced by collisions (“secondary fluorescence spectrum”). It is shown that the “fluctuation interval” in the λ3250 group has a magnitude, and varies with exciting frequency, in reasonable accord with the theory. From its magnitude approximate conclusions are drawn about the minimum energy and equilibrium internuclear distance for the D state potential curve. Further experimental work should be of interest. (5) The emission band systems obtained in the presence of considerable pressures of foreign gases (N2 or Ar) are discussed, and reasonable assignments for some of their upper, ion-pair type, initial states are given. In the case of the very strong region with maximum near λ 3425, proposals of Verma, Wieland, and Tellinghuisen are considered, but further work will be necessary before definite conclusions can be reached. Very likely more than one electronic transition may be involved.},

The observed perturbation interactions are sampled at internuclear distances near 5 Å and are interpreted in a separated atom (I2=Ia+Ib; ψI2=φaφb; φa=‖ ja=3/2, ma〉) basis set. Near r=5 Å the X 0g+ and a′ 0g+ states are found to have predominant ma=−mb=±1/2 and ma=−mb=±3/2 character, respectively, but with slight ‖m‖=1/2∼‖m‖=3/2 mixing. In this pure ‖m‖ basis, S=sa+sb and Jatomic=ja+jb are not well defined, but in the limit of complete ‖m‖=1/2∼‖m‖= 3/2 mixing, S and Jatomic are well defined. The behavior of three gerade states (X 0g+, a′ 0g+, a 1g) at large internuclear distance has been analyzed using the long range theory of {LeRoy} and Bernstein. The results are in fair agreement with theoretical predictions, and give a direct and precise determination of the X state well depth, D00=12 440.083±0.145 cm−1.},

Perturbations between the D(0+u) state and isoenergetic levels of the c6 Rydberg state lead to pronounced resonances (dips) in the fluorescence excitation spectrum. Weaker absorption to the F(0+u) and F′(0+u) ion-pair states is identified at 170 and 150 nm, respectively. Below 149 nm electronically excited iodine atoms (I 6s 4P5/2 and I 6s 2P3/2) are formed by predissociation of high-lying Rydberg and ion-pair states.},

	abstract = {The {HeI}2 van der Waals complex was prepared from a dilute mixture of iodine in helium at a pressure of 100 atm by supersonic expansion through a nozzle into a vacuum. Laser-induced fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded for the B̃←X̃ transition of {HeI}2 as well as corresponding spectra for the He2I2 and I2 molecules in the expanding gas. I2 was found to be cooled by the expansion to a rotational temperature of 0.4 K, and a vibrational temperature of 50 K. Similarly, cold internal temperatures were attained by the van der Waals complexes. Evidence was found for vibrational predissociation of the {HeI}2 complex in both the X̃ and B̃ electronic states. The vibrational predissociation rate was found to depend weakly upon the degree of excitation of the I–I stretching mode, ν1. For ν1=1 in the X̃ state the predissociation rate was found to be greater than 5×106 s−1. In the B̃ state the vibrational predissociation rate is ∼5×1010 s−1 for ν1=27, decreasing to \&lt;5×109 s−1 for ν1⩽7. The small (3.4–4.0 cm−1) blue shifts of the vibronic bands of the {HeI}2 spectrum relative to corresponding bands of I2 indicate (1) the van der Waals complex is slightly more strongly bound in the X̃ state than it is in the B̃ state, and (2) the I–I bonding in both the X̃ and B̃ states of iodine is largely unaffected by the formation of the van der Waals bond with helium.},

	abstract = {The S1←S0 000 transitions of phenol and the hydrogen bonded phenol(H2O)1 cluster have been studied by high resolution fluorescence excitation spectroscopy. All lines in the monomer spectrum are split by 56±4 {MHz} due to the internal rotation of the −{OH} group about the a axis. The barrier for this internal motion is determined in the ground and excited states; V2″=1215 cm−1, and V2′=4710 cm−1. The rotational constants for the monomer in the ground state are in agreement with those reported in microwave studies. The excited state rotational constants were found to be A′=5313.7 {MHz}, B′=2620.5 {MHz}, and C′=1756.08 {MHz}. The region of the redshifted 000 transition of phenol(H2O)1 shows two distinct bands which are 0.85 cm−1 apart. Their splitting arises from a torsional motion which interchanges the two equivalent H atoms in the H2O moiety of the cluster. This assignment was confirmed by spin statistical considerations. Both bands could be fit to rigid rotor Hamiltonians. Due to the interaction between the overall rotation of the entire cluster and the internal rotation, both bands have different rotational constants. They show that V2′\&lt;V2″, and that the internal rotation axis is nearly parallel to the a-axis of the cluster. If it is assumed that the structure of the rotor part does not change upon electronic excitation, the internal motion becomes simply a rotation of the water molecule around its symmetry axis. Assuming this motion, barriers of 180 and 130 cm−1 could be estimated for the S0 and S1 states, respectively. The analysis of the rotational constants of the cluster yielded an O–O distance of the hydrogen bond of 2.93 Å in the ground state and 2.89 Å in the electronically excited state. In the equilibrium structure of the cluster, the plane containing phenol bisects the plane of the water molecule.},

When the second laser pulse in the two color experiment is delayed by 7 ns no line broadening due to the second ionizing absorption step is observed. Spectra of three vibronic bands in the S1 ←S0 transition of benzene (h6)–Ar and benzene (d6)–Ar were measured yielding a line spectrum with a linewidth of 130 {MHz}. Resolution is sufficient to demonstrate that no asymmetry splitting of the rotational lines occurs and the spectrum is to a high precision that of a symmetric rotor. A detailed analysis of the rotational structure yields an accurate set of rotational constants. We find that the Ar is located on the C6 rotational axis. Its distance from the benzene ring plane is 3.582 Å in the electronic ground state and decreases by 59±3 {mÅ} in the electronically excited state due to the increased polarizability of the benzene molecule after electronic excitation.},

	abstract = {The ultraviolet resonance spectrum of I2 observed in electric discharges in the region 1830–2370 A has been photographed at high resolution with a 21-ft vacuum grating spectrograph, and a thorough and complete analysis of the data in this region is given. The five doublet resonance series are shown to be excited from five rotational levels of vibrational level v″=0 of the ground state of I2 to three vibrational levels (vn′,vn+0′,vn+4′) of an upper electronic state by a single iodine atomic line 1830.4 A. The rotational constants for the ground state of I2 may be represented: (1)v=0.03734−0.0001208 (v+12)+0.444×10−6(v+12)2−1.839×10−8(v+12)3−0.057×10−10(v+12)4(2)v=1.99×10−9+1.236×10−10(v+12).The ground-state ΔG(v+12) values have been obtained from v″=0 up to the dissociation limit. A precise value of the dissociation energy of I2, has been found to be 12 452.5±1.5 cm—1 as against the previous value of 12439±8 cm—1.
            The potential energy curve of X 1Σg+ has been computed by using the Rydberg-Klein-Rees method after modifying its final expressions, right up to the dissociation limit, and certain curious features in the neighbourhood of the dissociation limit are pointed out. The curve follows the van der Waals force law c/r6 between r=4.6 A and r=6.4 A with c=3.7×106. Various possibilities for the nature of the upper electronic state are discussed.},

In these test cases, the {NDEs} show efficiency comparable to that for the traditional polynomials in (v+1/2). For data sets which span an intermediate range of v levels, the {NDEs} are clearly superior to the polynomials for extrapolating to higher v, and of comparable reliability in extrapolation to low v. However, in their approach to dissociation, the {NDEs} can show unphysical behavior, the correction of which requires further constraints on the form of the {NDE}. Also, for lengthy extrapolations the {NDEs} may yield optimistically precise yet erroneous values for the dissociation energy. The present best estimates of the dissociation energies (𝒟e) for the lower states involved in these calculations are 2506.0(3) cm−1 for I2(A′), 2828(8) cm−1 for Br2(A′), and 281.1(7) cm−1 for {XeCl}(X).},

As a diatomic molecule its spectra are relatively simple and allow straightforward treatment of the data leading to the potential energy curves and to quantum mechanics concepts. The overtone bands, in the resonance Raman scattering, and the band progressions, in the electronic spectra, play an important role in the calculation of the Morse potential curves for the fundamental and excited electronic state. A weaker chemical bond in the electronic excited state, compared to the fundamental state, is evidenced by the increase in the equilibrium interatomic distance. The resonance Raman scattering of I 2 is highlighted due to its importance for obtaining the anharmonicity constant in the fundamental electronic state.},

              Iodine is a promising propellant for future plasma thrusters used in space propulsion. It is therefore important to understand the basic physics and chemistry of low-pressure iodine plasmas. In the present work, optical absorption methods are used to measure the densities of iodine molecules, I
              2
              , and iodine atoms, I, the translational temperature of the atoms and the dissociation fraction. The plasma is generated in a long quartz tube by a capacitively coupled {RF} discharge, and the pressure is varied between a few Pa and a few tens of Pa. The translational temperature of the atom vapour increases both with {RF} power and with pressure and reaches 1000 K at 50 W and 25 Pa. The molecules appear to be efficiently dissociated, with a dissociation fraction found above 65\%, on average along the line-of-sight, at 120 W and 5 Pa.

	abstract = {An algorithm is proposed, based principally on an earlier proposition of Flaud and co-workers [Mol. Phys. 32 (1976) 499], that inverts the information contained in uniquely assigned experimental rotational–vibrational transitions in order to obtain measured active rotational–vibrational energy levels ({MARVEL}). The procedure starts with collecting, critically evaluating, selecting, and compiling all available measured transitions, including assignments and uncertainties, into a single database. Then, spectroscopic networks ({SN}) are determined which contain all interconnecting rotational–vibrational energy levels supported by the grand database of the selected transitions. Adjustment of the uncertainties of the lines is performed next, with the help of a robust weighting strategy, until a self-consistent set of lines and uncertainties is achieved. Inversion of the transitions through a weighted least-squares-type procedure results in {MARVEL} energy levels and associated uncertainties. Local sensitivity coeﬃcients could be computed for each energy level. The resulting set of {MARVEL} levels is called active as when new experimental measurements become available the same evaluation, adjustment, and inversion procedure should be repeated in order to obtain more dependable energy levels and uncertainties. {MARVEL} is tested on the example of the H217O isotopologue of water and a list of 2736 dependable energy levels, based on 8369 transitions, has been obtained.},

In the absence of foreign gases, approximately 75\% of the excited molecules are in v′=15, 10\% in v′=14, and 10\% in v′=16. Steady-state fluorescence from these levels and neighboring levels populated by collisions with added inert molecules has been used to obtain collision cross sections for exchange of vibrational energy of excited I2 with the translational energy of the gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, H2, {HD}, D2, N2, O2, and {NO}. Relative emission intensities were measured photoelectrically. Vibrational transfer is highly efficient; cross sections for one quantum transfer average about ⅛ kinetic-theory cross sections taken from gas viscosities and are similar to those obtained by other workers for transfer from v′=25. Information on multiple quanta transfer could not be obtained directly because of band overlapping. On transfer of a vibrational quantum by He, H2, {HD}, and D2, some persistence of the initial rotational state in I2 was observed, while with the heavier gases the rotational distribution was spread. In collisions with {HD} no evidence was found for any resonance exchange between {HD} rotational energy (91 cm—1 for the J=0↔1 transition) and I2 vibrational energy (100 cm—1 for level separation around v′=15). Quenching of the fluorescence by the above foreign gases and by I2 itself was found to be proportional to the product of the polarizability of the inert molecules and the reciprocal of the relative velocity of the colliding particles. Absolute radiative transition probabilities for a number of individual rotational lines in the I2 visible spectrum have also been determined.},

In the (1+2) photoexcitation sequence, we gain access to the 1(u)(P-3(2)) ion-pair state through the A(3){II}(1(u)) state. The 2(u)(P-3(2)) state is also identified from the occurrence of extra lines through heterogeneous coupling with the 1(u)(P-3(2)) State and an apparent energy shift in the 1(u)(P-3(2)) state. The energy levels of the 1(u)(P-3(2)) and 2(u)(P-3(2)) states were analyzed in detail by including the heterogeneous interaction between these states. We have established the vibrational numbering of the 2(u)(P-3(2)) State in considering the 1(u)-2(u)(P-3(2)) interaction terms under a pure precession approximation. Combined with other results, the present study has allowed us to characterize and map out the ion-pair states of I-2 in the 5 {eV} region.},

            We present results of investigation and comparison of spectral properties of molecular iodine transitions in the spectral region of 514.7 nm that are suitable for laser frequency stabilization and metrology of length. Eight Doppler-broadened transitions that were not studied in detail before were investigated with the help of frequency doubled Yb-doped fiber laser, and three of the most promising lines were studied in detail with prospect of using them in frequency stabilization of new laser standards. The spectral properties of hyperfine components (linewidths, signal-to-noise ratio) were compared with transitions that are well known and traditionally used for stabilization of frequency doubled Nd:{YAG} laser at the 532 nm region with the same molecular iodine absorption. The external frequency doubling arrangement with waveguide crystal and the Yb-doped fiber laser is also briefly described together with the observed effect of laser aging.},

For efficient propellant usage, electric propulsion systems based on the electrostatic acceleration of ions formed during electron impact ionization of a gas are particularly attractive5,6. At present, xenon is used almost exclusively as an ionizable propellant for space propulsion2–5. However, xenon is rare, it must be stored under high pressure and commercial production is expensive7–9. Here we demonstrate a propulsion system that uses iodine propellant and we present in-orbit results of this new technology. Diatomic iodine is stored as a solid and sublimated at low temperatures. A plasma is then produced with a radio-frequency inductive antenna, and we show that the ionization efficiency is enhanced compared with xenon. Both atomic and molecular iodine ions are accelerated by high-voltage grids to generate thrust, and a highly collimated beam can be produced with substantial iodine dissociation. The propulsion system has been successfully operated in space onboard a small satellite with manoeuvres confirmed using satellite tracking data. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the adoption of alternative propellants within the space industry and demonstrate the potential of iodine for a wide range of space missions. For example, iodine enables substantial system miniaturization and simplification, which provides small satellites and satellite constellations with new capabilities for deployment, collision avoidance, end-of-life disposal and space exploration10–14.},

            This paper investigates iodine as an alternative propellant for space plasma propulsion. Measurements are taken in a low-pressure inductively-coupled plasma chamber used as the ionization stage of a gridded ion-engine. Langmuir probes are used to measure the electron density and the electron energy distribution functions spatial variations between the inductive coil and the extraction grids for several radio-frequency ({RF}) powers and mass flow rates. Measurements in iodine are compared to xenon, krypton and argon in order to evaluate performances of these various propellants for ionization (and therefore power) efficiency. At low mass flow rates, iodine is found to be the most efficient propellant, however, as the mass flow rate increases, the ionization cost in iodine increases rapidly due to both its molecular and electronegative nature. The ratio of negative ion to electron density is measured using laser-induced photodetachment in order to quantify the effect of iodine electronegativity. Finally, all measurements are compared to a previously published global (volume-averaged) model. The agreement between model and experiments is acceptable, however several modelling improvements are proposed.},

In this range, we have observed 1204 reference lines, 417 more lines than Salami and Ross (2005). The remaining lines are in good agreement with the works carried out by Gerstenkorn and Luc (1979) and by Salami and Ross (2005). The spectrum predicted by the software Iodine Spec5 reproduced our results very accurately.},

	abstract = {We have recorded electronic spectra of some diatomic species (I2, K2, and {NaK}), to illustrate the potential power of the combination of two high resolution techniques: intra-cavity laser induced ﬂuorescence ({ICLIF}) and Fourier transform ({FT}) spectroscopy. Active and passive optical cavities have been used, working with visible continuous wave (cw) laser sources. The active cavity is a modiﬁed commercial ring dye laser, allowing for a sample up to 25 cm in length. Dispersed ﬂuorescence spectra recorded on a Bomem Fourier transform spectrometer showed a signal enhancement of about 10 when a molecular source was placed within the resonator. The system was tested with a heatpipe source, producing alkali metal vapour at about 300 °C. These experiments illustrate enhanced cascade excitation mechanisms in K2; the highest vibrational levels of the electronic ground state of K2 can be observed with surprising ease. The increase in available power within the cavity has also led to the observation of ﬂuorescence in {NaK} excited by a two-photon transition (Q (66) 61R+ ‹ X1R+ transition). Spatial limitations have driven us to build a more versatile ring cavity able to accommodate larger sources. This broad-band (590–650 nm) build-up cavity is locked by a Ha¨nsch–Couillaud servo-loop to an input laser of (instantaneous) bandwidth \$1 {MHz}. Power enhancement factors of around 30 have been obtained with a 2.6\% input coupler. The performance of the build-up cavity has been tested by recording {FT} spectra of intra-cavity laser induced ﬂuorescence of iodine. The technique clearly has useful applications for weakly absorbing species, or for those whose electronic states are inaccessible to single-photon absorption techniques. This paper describes the arrangement we have used, highlighting some of the advantages and describing some of the particular diﬃculties we have encountered.},
