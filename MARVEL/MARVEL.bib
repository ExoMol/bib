Title = {A Network Approach for the Accurate Characterization of Water Lines
   Observable in Astronomical Masers and Extragalactic Environments},
Journal = {ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Abstract = {The water molecule, crucial to the chemical composition and dynamics of
   the universe, is typically identified in its gas phase via radio and
   submillimeter transitions, with frequencies up to a few THz. To
   understand the physicochemical behavior of astronomical objects,
   accurate transition frequencies are required for these lines. From a set
   of 26 new and 564 previous Lamb dip measurements, utilizing our
   ultrasensitive laser-based spectrometers in the near-infrared region,
   ultrahigh-precision spectroscopic networks were set up for (H2O)-O-16
   and (H2O)-O-18, augmented with 40 extremely accurate frequencies taken
   from the literature. Based on kHz-accuracy paths of these networks,
   considerably improved line-center frequencies have been obtained for 35
   observed or predicted maser lines of (H2O)-O-16, as well as for 14
   transitions of astronomical significance of (H2O)-O-18. These reference
   frequencies, attached with 5-25 kHz uncertainties, may help future
   studies in various fields of astrochemistry and astrophysics, in
   particular when precise information is demanded about Doppler-velocity
   components, including the gas flows of galactic cores, the kinematics of
   planetary nebulae, or the motion in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

Abstract = {Network theory has fundamentally transformed our comprehension of
   complex systems, catalyzing significant advances across various domains
   of science and technology. In spectroscopic networks, hubs are the
   quantum states involved in the largest number of transitions. Here,
   utilizing network paths probed via precision metrology, absolute
   energies have been deduced, with at least 10-digit accuracy, for almost
   200 hubs in the experimental spectroscopic networks of (H2O)-O-16 and
   (H2O)-O-18. These hubs, lying on the ground vibrational states of both
   species and the bending fundamental of (H2O)-O-16, are involved in tens
   of thousands of observed transitions. Relying on the same hubs and other
   states, benchmark-quality line lists have been assembled, which
   supersede and improve, by three orders of magnitude, the accuracy of the
   massive amount of data reported in hundreds of papers dealing with
   Doppler-limited spectroscopy. Due to the omnipresence of water, these
   ultraprecise line lists could be applied to calibrate high-resolution
   spectra and serve ongoing and upcoming space missions.},

Title = {Verification labels for rovibronic quantum-state energy uncertainties},
Journal = {Sci. Rep.},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Abstract = {Transition wavenumbers contained in line-by-line rovibronic databases
   can be compromised by errors of various nature. When left undetected,
   these errors may result in incorrect quantum-state energies, potentially
   compromising a large number of derived spectroscopic data. Spectroscopic
   networks treat the complete set of line-by-line spectroscopic data as a
   large graph, and through a least-squares refinement the measured line
   positions are converted into empirical quantum-state energies.
   Spectroscopic networks also offer a highly useful framework to develop
   mathematical tools helping to identify possible errors and conflicts
   within the dataset. For example, wavenumber errors can be detected by
   checking for violations of the law of energy conservation. This paper
   describes a new graph-theory tool, which results in so-called
   verification labels for the quantum states. Verification labels help to
   express the vulnerability of a calculated empirical energy value and its
   uncertainty against possible wavenumber errors, providing complementary
   information to simple statistical uncertainties.},

   Abstract = {Spectroscopic networks provide a particularly useful representation of
      observed rovibronic transitions of molecules, as well as of related

      the measured transitions forming a set of edges. Among their several
      uses, SNs offer a practical framework to assess data in line-by-line

      transition entries. Methods which achieve this validation work for
      transitions taking part in at least one cycle in a measured

      two-edge-connectivity of graph theory, introduced here to
      high-resolution spectroscopy, offers an elegant approach that
      facilitates putting the maximum number of bridges, if not all, into at
      least one cycle. An algorithmic solution is shown how to augment an
      existing spectroscopic network with a minimum number of new
      spectroscopic measurements selected according to well-defined
      guidelines. In relation to this, two metrics are introduced, ranking
      measurements based on their utility toward achieving the goal of

      molecules can be huge, qualifying for the big data description. Besides
      helping to interpret high-resolution spectra, the network-theoretical

Experiments naturally build random graphs.

      190-5]. MARVEL validates the high accuracy of most of the measured line
      positions. It results in a considerable number of energy levels with an
      average internal uncertainty of only 40 kHz (2 sigma). It also supports
      serious inaccuracy problems when Watson-type A-reduced Hamiltonians are
      used for predicting the highly accurate rotational measurements for
      water. Finally, MARVEL suggests a large number of para-water levels, for
      example 41 for (H2O)-O-16, which are candidates for becoming frequency
      standards in the FIR region of 15-170 cm$^{-1}$ (the 0.5-5 THz window) when
      an accuracy of about 0.1 MHz is deemed to be sufficient.}},

   title ={The Use of Term-Value Fits in Testing Spectroscopic Assignments},
   Journal = JMS,
   Year = {{1994}},
   Volume = {{165}},
   Pages = {283-290},
   Abstract = {{The use of a least-squares term-value fit of a spectrum as a means of
      testing assignments is described. In a direct term-value fit the normal
      matrix is singular, with one zero eigenvalue for each set of connected
      levels. These equations are solved by a method which gives the term
      values of each connected set relative to their mean. The standard
      deviation sigma from a term-value fit should be equal to the measurement
      error. It is shown that, as a test of individual assignments, it is
      possible to calculate from the results of a fit the fractional change
      tau(l) = (sigma(l) - sigma)/sigma when each line l is omitted singly
      from the fit. Anomalously large negative values of tau(l) indicate lines
      that may be misassigned or mismeasured. As an example, it is shown that
      the standard deviation of an unweighted term-value fit of a published
      compilation of 294 lines of the H-3+ ion can be reduced from 0.031 cm$^{-1}$
      to 0.004 cm$^{-1}$ by the omission of 7 lines. }},
