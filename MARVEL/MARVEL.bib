Journal = {J. Cheminfo.},

Abstract = {{Improving the accuracy of absolute energies associated with rovibronic
   quantum states of molecules requires accurate high-resolution
   spectroscopy measurements. Such experiments yield transition wavenumbers
   from which the energies can be deduced via inversion procedures. To
   address the problem that not all transitions contribute equally to the
   goal of improving the accuracy of the energies, the method of Connecting
   Spectroscopic Components (CSC) is introduced. Using spectroscopic
   networks and tools of graph theory, CSC helps to find the most useful
   target transitions and target wavenumber regions for (re)measurement.
   The sets of transitions suggested by CSC should be investigated by
   experimental research groups in order to select those target lines which
   they can actually measure based on the apparatus available to them. The
   worked-out examples, utilizing extensive experimental spectroscopic data
   on the molecules H-2 O-16, (SO2)-S-32-O-16, H-2 (12) C-16 O, and
   (NH3)-N-14, clearly prove the overall usefulness of the CSC method and
   provide suggestions how CSC can be used for various tasks and under
   different practical circumstances.}},

Journal = {Sci. Rep.},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Spectroscopic networks provide a particularly useful representation of
   observed rovibronic transitions of molecules, as well as of related
   quantum states, whereby the states form a set of vertices connected by
   the measured transitions forming a set of edges. Among their several
   uses, SNs offer a practical framework to assess data in line-by-line
   spectroscopic databases. They can be utilized to help detect flawed
   transition entries. Methods which achieve this validation work for
   transitions taking part in at least one cycle in a measured
   spectroscopic network but they do not work for bridges. The concept of
   two-edge-connectivity of graph theory, introduced here to
   high-resolution spectroscopy, offers an elegant approach that
   facilitates putting the maximum number of bridges, if not all, into at
   least one cycle. An algorithmic solution is shown how to augment an
   existing spectroscopic network with a minimum number of new
   spectroscopic measurements selected according to well-defined
   guidelines. In relation to this, two metrics are introduced, ranking
   measurements based on their utility toward achieving the goal of
   two-edge-connectivity. Utility of the new concepts are demonstrated on
   spectroscopic data of 14NH3.}},

Abstract = {{The cyano radical (CN) is a key molecule across many different factions
   of astronomy and chemistry. Accurate, empirical rovibronic energy levels
   with uncertainties are determined for eight doublet states of CN using
   the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels)
   algorithm. 40 333 transitions were validated from 22 different published
   sources to generate 8083 spin-rovibronic energy levels. The empirical
   energy levels obtained from the MARVEL analysis are compared to current
   energy levels from the MOLLIST line list. The MOLLIST transition
   frequencies are updated with MARVEL energy level data which brings the
   frequencies obtained through experimental data up to 77.3 per cent from
   the original 11.3 per cent, with 92.6 per cent of the transitions with
   intensities over 10(-23) cm molecule(-1) at 1000 K now known from
   experimental data. At 2000 K, 100.0 per cent of the partition function

Abstract = {{Frequency combs and cavity-enhanced optical techniques have

   theory, based on the generalized Ritz principle, offers a powerful tool

   differences. As a proof of concept, 156 carefully-selected near-infrared
   transitions are detected for (H2O)-O-16, a benchmark system of molecular
   spectroscopy, at kHz accuracy. These measurements, augmented with 28
   extremely-accurate literature lines to ensure overall connectivity,
   allow the precise determination of the lowest ortho-(H2O)-O-16 energy,
   now set at 23.794 361 22(25) cm(-1), and 160 energy levels with
   similarly high accuracy. Based on the limited number of observed

abstract = {Approaches related to graph theory are investigated which allow a better understanding and yield routes for systematic enlargement and improvement of experimental spectroscopic line lists of molecules. The proposed protocols are based on the fact that quantum mechanics builds, in a simple and natural way, large-scale, weighted, undirected graphs, whereby the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. A small part of molecular quantum mechanical graphs can be probed experimentally via high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, while the complete graph encompassing the full line list information for a given molecule can be obtained through sophisticated variational nuclear motion computations. Both approaches yield what one may call spectroscopic networks (SNs). It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule that both the measured and the computed one-photon absorption SNs have a scale-free behavior with all of the usual consequences, including appearance of hubs, robustness, error tolerance, and the “small-world” property. For the complete computed “deterministic” network the scale-free property holds if a realistic intensity cut-off is employed during its build-up, thus introducing “stochasticity”. The graph-theoretical view of molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of the information systems containing high-resolution spectroscopic data. }

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are "deterministic" by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness ("stochasticity") is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. }

Pages = {283-290},
Abstract = {{The use of a least-squares term-value fit of a spectrum as a means of
   testing assignments is described. In a direct term-value fit the normal
   matrix is singular, with one zero eigenvalue for each set of connected
   levels. These equations are solved by a method which gives the term
   values of each connected set relative to their mean. The standard
   deviation sigma from a term-value fit should be equal to the measurement
   error. It is shown that, as a test of individual assignments, it is
   possible to calculate from the results of a fit the fractional change
   tau(l) = (sigma(l) - sigma)/sigma when each line l is omitted singly
   from the fit. Anomalously large negative values of tau(l) indicate lines
   that may be misassigned or mismeasured. As an example, it is shown that
   the standard deviation of an unweighted term-value fit of a published
   compilation of 294 lines of the H-3+ ion can be reduced from 0.031 cm-1
   to 0.004 cm-1 by the omission of 7 lines. }},
