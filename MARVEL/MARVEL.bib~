abstract = {Approaches related to graph theory are investigated which allow a better understanding and yield routes for systematic enlargement and improvement of experimental spectroscopic line lists of molecules. The proposed protocols are based on the fact that quantum mechanics builds, in a simple and natural way, large-scale, weighted, undirected graphs, whereby the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. A small part of molecular quantum mechanical graphs can be probed experimentally via high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, while the complete graph encompassing the full line list information for a given molecule can be obtained through sophisticated variational nuclear motion computations. Both approaches yield what one may call spectroscopic networks (SNs). It is shown on the example of the \{HD16O\} isotopologue of the water molecule that both the measured and the computed one-photon absorption \{SNs\} have a scale-free behavior with all of the usual consequences, including appearance of hubs, robustness, error tolerance, and the “small-world” property. For the complete computed “deterministic” network the scale-free property holds if a realistic intensity cut-off is employed during its build-up, thus introducing “stochasticity”. The graph-theoretical view of molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of the information systems containing high-resolution spectroscopic data. }

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles \{SNs\} are “deterministic” by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness (“stochasticity”) is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the \{HD16O\} isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed \{SNs\} can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. }
