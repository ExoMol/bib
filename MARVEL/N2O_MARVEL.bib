abstract = {We report on a comb-locked cavity ring-down spectrometer developed for high-precision molecular spectroscopy at 2 $\mu$m. It is based on the use of an external-cavity diode laser that is offset-frequency locked to the signal output of a singly-resonant optical parametric oscillator. This latter acts as a reference laser, being locked to a self-referenced optical frequency comb, which in turn is stabilized against a GPS-disciplined Rb-clock. The performance of the spectrometer is investigated by probing a pair of N2O transitions belonging to hot vibrational bands. One of these has never, to the best of our knowledge, been observed before, and is included in the N2O line list of the ExoMol database. Absolute center frequencies are retrieved with a 1-$\sigma$ global uncertainty of 108 kHz.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas. Its isotopic composition provides valuable insights into sources and sinks, and about the mechanisms of formation. A major challenge in the spectroscopic analysis of the isotopocule compositions is the availability of accurate spectroscopic parameters, particularly for the minor 15N isotopocules. In this work, we introduce high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of four isotopocules of nitrous oxide: 14N2O, 14N15NO, 15N14NO, and 15N2O in the mid-infrared range of 3300 – 3550 cm–1 using a frequency comb-based Fourier transform spectrometer. The nitrous oxide samples were obtained from a chemical synthesis involving acid-catalyzed amine-borane reduction of equimolar amounts of 15N isotopically enriched sodium nitrite and 14N sodium nitrite. The high-resolution spectra, measured in a temperature-controlled single-pass absorption cell, were used to retrieve line center frequencies and relative intensities for a total of 426 rovibrational transitions of the ν1 + ν3 band of the four isotopocules, and of the one order of magnitude weaker 2ν2 + ν3 and ν1 + ν2 + ν3 – ν2 bands in the same spectral region. We compare the determined line center frequencies and relative intensities with spectroscopic parameters available in high-resolution molecular databases. For 14N2O, 14N15NO and 15N14NO we find good agreement with the HITRAN database. The 15N2O isotopocule is missing in HITRAN, and we find that its line center frequencies in the GEISA database, the Institute of Atmospheric Optics database, as well as the Ames-1 line list deviate severely from the comb measurements.}

Abstract = {Using a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser and wavelength modulation
   absorption spectroscopy, we measure the frequencies of ro-vibrational
   transitions of N2O in the 17 mu m region with uncertainties below 5 MHz.
   These lines, corresponding to the bending mode of the molecule, can be

   present a model for the lineshapes of absorption features in wavelength
   modulation spectroscopy that takes into account Doppler broadening,
   collisional broadening, saturation of the absorption, and lineshape
   distortion due to frequency and intensity modulation. Combining our data
   with previous measurements, we provide a set of spectroscopic parameters
   for several vibrational states of N2O. The lines measured here fall in
   the same spectral region as a mid-infrared frequency reference that we
   are currently developing using trapped, ultracold molecules. With such a
   frequency reference, the spectroscopic methods demonstrated here have
   the potential to improve frequency calibration in this part of the

Eight 14N216O bands were found affected by local rovibrational perturbations and a total of 31 extra lines due to an intensity transfer could be identified.

For a long time FTIR and laser-based spectroscopies were used for these studies. The recent development of dual-comb spectroscopy at high-resolution makes this technique a powerful tool for gas phase studies. We report on the use and characterization of the IRis-F1, a tabletop mid-infrared dual-comb spectrometer, in the newly developed step-sweep mode. The resolution of the wavenumber axis is increased by step-wise tuning (interleaving) and accurate measurement of the laser center wavelength and repetition frequency. Doppler limited measurements of N2O and CH4 reveal a wavenumber accuracy of 10−4 cm${-1}$ on the covered range of > 50 cm${-1}$. Measured half-widths of absorption lines show no systematic broadening, indicating a negligible instrument response function. Finally, measurements of nitrogen pressure broadening coefficients in the ν4 band of methane show that quantum cascade laser dual-comb spectroscopy in step-sweep mode is well adapted for measurements of precision spectroscopic data, in particular line shape parameters.}

    abstract = { Although gas phase rotational spectroscopy is a mature field for which millions of rotational spectral lines have been measured in hundreds of molecules with sub-MHz accuracy, it remains a challenge to measure these rotational spectra in excited vibrational modes with the same accuracy. Recently, it was demonstrated that virtually any rotational transition in excited vibrational modes of most molecules may be made to lase when pumped by a continuously tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL). Here, we demonstrate how an infrared QCL may be used to enhance absorption strength or induce lasing of terahertz rotational transitions in highly excited vibrational modes in order to measure their frequencies more accurately. To illustrate the concepts, we used a tunable QCL to excite v3 R-branch transitions in N2O and either enhanced absorption or induced lasing on 20 v3 rotational transitions, whose frequencies between 299 and 772 GHz were then measured using either heterodyne or modulation spectroscopy. The spectra were fitted to obtain the rotational constants B3 and D3, which reproduce the measured spectra to within the experimental uncertainty of ± 5 kHz. We then show how this technique may be generalized by estimating the threshold power to make any rotational transition lase in any N2O vibrational mode.Graphical Abstract }

The assigned transitions belong to 49 bands of the 14N216O, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O, 14N218O, and 14N217O isotopologues, 16 being newly assigned.

For comparison, the HITRAN2020 database includes only the ν1+3ν3 band of the main isotopologue and a number of calculated line parameters for the fourth minor isotopologue, 14N218O. The band-by-band analysis provides accurate spectroscopic parameters of 46 bands from a fit of the measured line positions. Nine resonance perturbations were identified including a few extra lines for two 14N216O bands. The interaction mechanisms and the perturbers were assigned on the basis of the effective Hamiltonian models. The comparison with current spectroscopic databases (HITRAN, HITEMP, NOSD) is discussed. All show significant deviations compared to our observations (e.g. for ∆P= 13 band intensities). The reported results will be thus valuable to more accurately account for the absorption of nitrous oxide in the region.}

Careful comparisons of broadening parameters using the Voigt and speed-dependent Voigt line-shape profiles were performed among various published results for both N2O and CO. Selected data allowed for developing semi-empirical models, which were used to extrapolate/interpolate existing data to update broadening parameters of all the lines of these molecules in the HITRAN database. In addition to the line broadening parameters (and their temperature dependences), the pressure shift values were revised for N2O and CO broadened by air and self for all the bands. The air and self speed-dependence of the broadening parameter for these two molecules were added for every transition as well.

   1\% which is approximately five times smaller than literature values.
   Comparison of the present air-broadening and speed-dependent broadening
   parameters to experimental literature values for other
   rotation-vibration bands of N2O indicates significant differences in

Title = {{The absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide between 8325 and 8622 cm$^{-1}$}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Abstract = {{The weak high-resolution absorption spectrum of natural nitrous oxide
   has been recorded by high sensitivity cavity ring down spectroscopy
   (CRDS) near 1.18 mu m. The frequency scale of the spectra was obtained
   by coupling the CRDS spectrometer to a self-referenced frequency comb.
   The room temperature recordings, performed with a pressure of 1 Torr,
   cover the 8325-8622 cm(-1) spectral interval where previous observations
   were very scarce. More than 3300 lines belonging to four N2O
   isotopologues (N-14(2) O-16, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O, and 14N2 18O) are
   measured with a position accuracy better than 1 \& times; 10 \& minus;3
   cm \& minus;1 for most of the lines. Line intensities at room
   temperature range between 1.2 \& times; 10 \& minus;25 and 3.8 \& times;
   10 \& minus;30 cm/molecule. The rovibrational assignments were obtained
   by comparison with predictions based on the global modeling of the line
   positions and intensities performed within the framework of the method
   of effective operators. The band-by-band analysis led to the
   determination of the rovibrational parameters of a total of 47 bands.
   All identified bands belong to the AP = 14-16 series of transitions,
   where P = 2 V 1 + V 2 + 4 V 3 is the polyad number (Vi= 1-3 are the
   vibrational quantum numbers). Among these bands, only five were
   previously observed and bands of the AP = 15 series are reported for the
   first time. Local resonance perturbations affecting two bands are
   identified and analyzed. The position and intensity comparisons to the
   HITRAN2016 and HITEMP2019 spectroscopic databases are discussed. The
   HITRAN line list is limited to only four (calculated) bands of the 14N2
   18O isotopologue in the studied region while AP = 15 bands are missing
   in the HITEMP list. The present work will help to improve future
   versions of the spectroscopic databases of nitrous oxide, a strong
   greenhouse gas. }},

The recent development of dual-comb spectroscopy at high-resolution makes this technique a powerful tool for gas phase studies. We report on the use and characterization of the IRis-F1, a tabletop mid-infrared dual-comb spectrometer, in the newly developed step-sweep mode. The resolution of the wavenumber axis is increased by step-wise tuning (interleaving) and accurate measurement of the laser center wavelength and repetition frequency. Doppler limited measurements of N2O and CH4 reveal a wavenumber accuracy of 10−4 cm${-1}$ on the covered range of > 50 cm${-1}$. Measured half-widths of absorption lines show no systematic broadening, indicating a negligible instrument response function. Finally, measurements of nitrogen pressure broadening coefficients in the ν4 band of methane show that quantum cascade laser dual-comb spectroscopy in step-sweep mode is well adapted for measurements of precision spectroscopic data, in particular line shape parameters.}

A population inversion of rotationally excited N2O states was prepared with an optical centrifuge and probed in a multi-pass IR cell using a quantum cascade laser. The optical centrifuge is based on 800-nm ultrafast, chirped laser pulses that optically trap molecules and accelerate them angularly to extreme rotational states. This work substantially increases the range of observed transitions for this band beyond the J = 100 transitions previously reported and provides benchmark measurements for theoretical predictions based on an effective Hamiltonian using a polyad model. Transient Doppler-broadened IR line profiles of N2O show that optical excitation of the sample is selectively partitioned into rotation, prior to Doppler broadening from rotation-to-translation collisional energy transfer. These results demonstrate how high-J transitions can be measured without thermal heating by coupling optical centrifuge excitation with high-resolution transient IR absorption probing.}

Abstract = {{In spite of being a greenhouse gas with a large global warming
   potential, the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide in the near infrared
   is insufficiently characterized. In the present work, the spectral
   region near 1.74 mu m (5696-5910 cm(-1)) is investigated by high
   sensitivity cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). The noise level of the
   CRDS spectra corresponds to a typical minimum detectable absorption,
   alpha(min), below 10(-10) cm(-1). 3326 transitions are measured and
   rovibrationally assigned to 50 bands of five nitrous oxide isotopologues
   ((N2O)-N-14-O-16, (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16, (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16,
   (N2O)-N-14-O-18 and (N2O)-N-14-O-17) in natural isotopic abundance. The
   assigned weakest lines have an intensity below 10(-28)cm/molecule. For
   comparison, only three (N2O)-N-14-O-16 bands are included in the HITRAN
   database in the region, with a 2 x 10(-25)cm/molecule intensity cut off.
   The rovibrational assignments were performed by comparison with
   predictions performed for each isotopologue in the frame of the
   effective operator approach. The overall quality of the predictions is
   satisfactory for line positions. Deviations larger than 0.1 cm(-1) are
   nevertheless noted for (N2O)-N-14-O-16 and (N2O)-N-14-O-18.
   The spectroscopic parameters of the upper level of the observed bands
   were derived from the standard band-by-band fit of the measured line
   positions. A significant number of bands were found to be perturbed by
   local rovibrational perturbations and in some cases, extra lines due to
   an intensity transfer could be assigned. The interaction mechanisms and
   the perturbers were univocally identified on the basis of the effective
   Hamiltonian model. In particular, interpolyad couplings were evidenced
   indicating that the polyad version of the effective Hamiltonian has to
   be extended to include Coriolis and interpolyad anharmonic interactions.
   No satisfactory modeling of the N2O line intensities is yet available in
   the region. The CRDS intensity values derived in this work provide a
   solid set of measurements for future semi-empirical intensity modeling

   transitions over 2190-2202cm(-1) spectral range using a
   distributed-feedback quantum cascade laser. To retrieve spectroscopic
   parameters for each individual transition, measured absorption line
   shape is simulated within Voigt and Galatry profiles. The obtained
   results compare well with previous experimental data available in the
   literature: the discrepancies being less than 4\% for most of the probed

   the 7915-8334 cm(-1) spectral range. The assignments were performed by
   comparison with predictions of the effective Hamiltonian models
   developed for each isotopologue. In the present paper, the large amount
   of measurements from our previous work mentioned above and literature
   are gathered to refine the modeling of the nitrous oxide spectrum in two
   ways: (i) improvement of the intensity modeling for the principal
   isotopologue, (N2O)-N-14-O-16, near 8000 cm(-1) from a new fit of the
   relevant effective dipole moment parameters, (ii) global modeling of
   (N2O)-N-14-O-18 line positions from a new fit of the parameters of the
   global effective, Hamiltonian using an exhaustive input dataset
   collected in the literature in the 12-8231 cm(-1) region. The fitted set
   of 81 parameters allowed reproducing near 5800 measured line positions
   with an RMS deviation of 0.0016 cm(-1). The dimensionless weighted
   standard deviation of the fit is 1.22. As an illustration of the
   improvement of the predictive capabilities of the obtained effective
   Hamiltonian, two new (N2O)-N-14-O-18 bands could be assigned in the CRDS
   spectrum in the 7915-8334 cm(-1) spectral range. A line list at 296 K

   allowed reproducing the measured line positions within the experimental

   DFB lasers. The typical sensitivity of 2 x 10(-10) cm(-1), allowed for
   the detection of lines with intensity as weak as 2 x 10(-29) cm/molecule
   while the minimum intensity value provided by HITRAN in the considered
   spectral region is 2 x 10(-25) cm/mol- ecule. More than 6000 line
   positions of five isotopologues contributing to the spectra

   accuracy of 1.5 x 10(-3) cm(-1) and rovibrationally assigned on the
   basis of their respective global effective Hamiltonian models. Highly
   excited rovibrational levels corresponding to J values larger than 80
   could be detected for the stronger vibrational bands. The band by band
   analysis led to the determination of the rovibrational parameters of a
   total of 68 bands, 49 of them being newly reported. The rms value of the
   deviations of the predictions of the effective Hamiltonian models from
   the observed line positions is 0.010 cm(-1). As expected, the quality of
   the predictions degrades for the minor isotopologues for which important
   deviations up to a few wavenumbers were evidenced. Most of the bands
   were found unperturbed but in a few cases, local rovibrational
   perturbations were evidenced. The interaction mechanisms and the
   perturbers were univocally assigned on the basis of the effective
   Hamiltonian model. In particular, interpolyad couplings were evidenced
   indicating that the polyad version of the effective Hamiltonian has to
   be extended to include Coriolis and interpolyad anharmonic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamic structure of an axisymmetric supersonic expansion can
   be regarded as a series of concentric divergent cones, with decreasing
   particle densities as the cone angle increases. Different groups of
   molecules therefore contribute to high-resolution absorption line shapes
   when optically probing the expansion in a direction perpendicular to the
   jet axis. These groups are distinguished by the cone angle, inducing a
   specific Doppler shift, and by the particle density, contributing a
   specific weight to the absorption intensity. As a result different
   broader line profiles are observed compared to room temperature spectra.
   This effect is investigated here selecting as the working example the
   R(0), v(3) absorption line in N2O recorded using a Fourier transform
   interferometer. Independent impact pressure and quadrupole mass
   spectrometric measurements are performed leading to two complementary
   maps of the expansion, allowing the recorded absorption line shape to be

   the dependence from rotational quantum number previously observed for
   other rotational and rovibrational lines. They are well explained by
   calculations based on a semiclassical formalism that includes the
   atom-atom Lennard-Jones potential in addition to electrostatic
   interactions up to hexadecapolar contributions. In a second step,
   observed lineshapes were analyzed by using the Galatry profile and a
   speed-dependent Voigt profile. The nonlinear pressure behavior observed
   for the diffusion rate beta involved in the Galatry profile leads to
   rule out the possible role of velocity/speed changing collisions, and to
   infer that discrepancies from the Voigt profile result from the
   dependence of relaxation rates on molecular speeds. This interpretation
   is supported by the comparison of optical and kinetic radii and
   confirmed by theoretical calculations of relaxation rates. Finally, it
   can be claimed that, for the N2O-N-2 and N2O-O-2 systems, deviations
   from the Voigt profile are explained by a speed-dependent Voigt profile.}},

   connect states of the same polyad characterized by the pseudo quantum
   number n(e) = 2 nu (1) + nu (2) + 4 nu (3). The values of the parameters

   the predictive capabilities of this effective Hamiltonian. The

This Hamiltonian has been written up to the fourth order in the Amat-Nielsen ordering scheme and contains all resonance interaction terms due to the approximate relations between harmonic frequencies ω3 ≍ 2ω1 ≍ 4ω2. It has been found that the effective Hamiltonian under consideration possesses some ambiguities. To remove them the effective Hamiltonian has been transformed to a reduced form. Several reduced forms of the effective Hamiltonian have been considered, and the relations between the parameters of the transformed and untransformed effective Hamiltonians have been established. The parameters of the reduced effective Hamiltonians have been determined by a least-squares fit of the experimental values of effective spectroscopic constants Gv, Bv, and Dv. Different reduction schemes are investigated, and extrapolational properties of the corresponding effective Hamiltonians are briefly discussed.}

   plots in terms of (1) instability in the jet and (2) a two-temperature
   model for the flowing gas, a cold central core and a hot boundary layer
   close to the nozzle walls. The model based on jet instability represents
   the data somewhat poorer than the two-temperature model. The parameters
   derived from fitting our experimental data to the former model could be
   used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters only through further
   approximations. Measured absorption line profile of the P(15) line of
   the upsilon-2 band of N2O as a function of axial distance from the
   nozzle exit gradually shifts from a Lorentzian to a Gaussian type.
   Velocity distribution of N2O molecules in a Laval nozzle is determined
   by differentiating the absorption line profile of the P(15) line

New spectroscopic parameters have been determined for the v1 and v1 + v6 − v6 bands of C79BrF3 and C81BrF3 with band centers v−01 (C79BrF3) = 1084.7690(1),~ v01 (C81 BrF3) = 1084.5214(1), ~v0166(C79BrF3) = 1083.5292(2) and ~v0166 (C81BrF3) = 1083.2846(2) cm${-1}$ as well as for the v4 band of 12CF3I with band center ~v04 = 1187.6275(1) cm${-1}$. The results are important for IR-multiphoton excitation, laser chemistry, and atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopy.}
