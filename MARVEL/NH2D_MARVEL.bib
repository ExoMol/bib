  abstract = {High resolution (0.004 and 0.01cm-1 instrumental bandwidth) interferometric Fourier transform infrared spectra of N14H2D and N14D2H were measured on a Bomem DA002 spectrometer in a supersonic jet expansion and at room temperature. We report the analysis of the bending fundamentals of N14H2D with term values Tv(s)=1389.9063(2)cm-1 and Tv(a)=1390.4953(2)cm-1 for the {$\nu$}4b fundamental and Tv(s)=1605.6404(7)cm-1 and Tv(a)=1591.0019(7)cm-1 for the {$\nu$}4a fundamental, and of N14D2H with term values of Tv(s)=1233.3740(2)cm-1 and Tv(a)=1235.8904(2)cm-1 for the {$\nu$}4a fundamental and Tv(s)=1461.7941(9)cm-1 and Tv(a)=1461.9918(19)cm-1 for the {$\nu$}4b fundamental. In all cases Tv(s) gives the position of the symmetric inversion sublevel (with positive parity) and Tv(a) the position of the antisymmetric inversion sublevel (with negative parity). The notation for the fundamentals {$\nu$}4a and {$\nu$}4b is chosen by correlation with the degenerate {$\nu$}4 mode in the C3v symmetric molecules NH3 and ND3. The degeneracy is lifted in Cs symmetry and a indicates the symmetric, b the antisymmetric normal mode with respect to the Cs symmetry plane in NH2D and ND2H. Assignments were established with certainty by means of ground state combination differences. About 20 molecular parameters of the effective S-reduced Hamiltonian could be determined accurately for each fundamental. In particular, the effect of Fermi resonances of the 2{$\nu$}2 overtone with the {$\nu$}4a bending mode was observed, leading to an increased inversion splitting in the case of ND2H and to a strongly increased inversion splitting and an inverted order of the two inversion levels in NH2D. Rotational perturbations observed with the {$\nu$}4b bending fundamentals are probably due to Coriolis interactions with the inversion overtone 2{$\nu$}2. The results are important for understanding isotope effects on the inversion in ammonia as well as its selective catalysis and inhibition by excitation of different vibrational modes, as treated by quantum dynamics on high dimensional potential hypersurfaces of this molecule.},
