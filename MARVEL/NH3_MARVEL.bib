Abstract = {The room temperature absorption spectrum of ammonia is revisited between
   7400 and 8600 cm-1 on the basis of a Fourier transform absorption
   spectrum recorded at Universite<acute accent> Libre de Bruxelles. The
   retrieved empirical line list counts more than 8400 lines and extends
   significantly a previous list retrieved from the same spectrum and used
   as main source of line parameters in the HITRAN database, in the
   considered region. By comparison with a variational line list, the C2018
   list from Coles et al. (J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf
   2018;219:199-212. 10.1016/j.jqsrt.2018.07.022), and validating most of
   the assignments by using lower state combination difference relations
   (LSCD), about 2798 transitions are assigned. They belong to 60 bands and
   correspond to about 72 \% of the intensity sum in the region. The
   previous assignments by Barton et al. (J Mol Spectrosc 2016;325:7-12.
   10.1016/j.jms.2016.05.001) which are reproduced in the HITRAN database
   show a poor agreement with the present results. A set of 1149 empirical
   values of the upper state energy levels is provided with a typical
   accuracy of 10-3 cm-1.},

abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) holds significant importance as an industrial product, 
   ambient trace pollutant, and a promising zero-carbon energy carrier, underscoring the 
   critical need for accurate quantification in various applications. In this study, 
   a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (Mid-IR QCL) based tunable diode laser absorption 
   spectroscopy (TDLAS) spectrometer was developed. It was coupled with two reactors, namely 
   a gas cell and a shock tube and operated in three modes: low- and high-frequency (140 Hz and 
   10 kHz) scan modes and fixed-wavelength mode, tailored to the specific needs of each 
   experimental scenario. The primary objects were NH3 line parameters measurement and 
   absolute NH3 quantification. With the 140 Hz low-frequency scan mode, NH3-Ar pressure 
   broadening coefficients of six transition lines near 1084.6 cm−1 were measured in a gas 
   cell at 295 K and 1–11 mbar for the first time. These coefficients were subsequently employed 
   to quantify the initial NH3 mole fraction in shock tube experiments, considering the 
   substantial adsorption effect of NH3. Using the high-frequency scan mode (10 kHz), spectrally 
   resolved NH3 absorption cross-sections were obtained in a shock tube across a pressure range 
   of 1.46–3.25 bar and a temperature range of 1000–1800 K. This data, acquired for the first time, 
   significantly contributes to the understanding of NH3 behavior in high-temperature environments. 
   Additionally, potential interference from high-temperature water absorption near 1084.6 cm−1 was 
   thoroughly examined. The high-temperature water absorption cross-section was measured over a 
   pressure range of 0.99–3.02 bar and a temperature range of 1322–2905 K, utilizing a 
   near-infrared water laser. Leveraging these comprehensive datasets, the study quantified the 
   NH3 mole fraction during the NH3 oxidation process in the shock tube, employing the 
   fixed-wavelength mode to achieve high time resolution. The quantified NH3 mole fraction 
   was then compared to predictions from eleven recent chemical kinetic mechanisms, demonstrating 
   the utility of the developed spectrometer in validating these mechanisms.}

This region extends from just above the Franck-Condon envelope for the A∼ 1A2“ ← X∼ 1A1' transition to well above the NH3+ X∼+ 2A2” ionization threshold. The spectra were recorded at a measured resolution of 0.23 cm-1 in both a room-temperature cell (293 K) and in a slit-jet supersonic expansion (∼70 K). The absolute photoabsorption cross section with an uncertainty of ±5% is also reported for the room-temperature spectrum. The present resolution is a factor of 10 – 100 times higher than in other recently reported broad band spectra of ammonia, and many of the observed bands show partially resolved rotational structure. We have attempted to assign this structure for a number of these bands. The oscillator strengths extracted from the data are in good agreement with previous measurements but, in the case of structured bands, the present higher resolution measurements return higher peak absorption cross sections, that increase further when the sample is cooled. The present higher resolution spectra suggest that a number of previous vibronic band assignments that were based on quantum defect considerations may require some revision. Finally, we discuss the substantial differences between the photoabsorption and photoionization data just above the first ionization threshold.}

Definitive rovibrational quantum numbers were assigned for 1602 transitions pertaining to 809 upper levels and eight vibrational bands: 0111E, 0111A, 1101, 0310, 0211, 1300, 0103 and 0302. When compared to the results from Cacciani et al. [JQSRT 2020, 258:107,334], our results, termed as the “JPL+Ames 2021″ list (or JA list), showed good agreement for the assignment of 1278 transitions. We have further made new assignments for 179 transitions that were not assigned in their work, plus assignments for 87 new lines reported for the first time. Excellent agreement (± 0.002 cm−1) was observed in the line positions between this work and Cacciani et al., with no systematic discrepancies. Remaining discrepancies on the assignments have been attributed to line blendings, unaccounted resonances, the uncertainties of reference line lists, and limited transition-matching accuracy. An empirical line list (JPL) and a semi-empirical line list adopting the UCL-C2018 [Coles et al., JQSRT 2018, 219:199] intensity with the Ames HSL-Pre3 based line positions were employed as the major reference for our analysis. In addition to the line position / intensity measurements and cross-validation through combination difference analysis, part of the work has also required manual matches for valid transition and level pairs and checking the consistency and patterns of δΕCalc-Obs, inversion splittings Δa-s, etc. Band-by-band discussions are presented on the missing intensity of ν2+3ν4 (0103), the unusual sensitivity of ν1+3ν2 (1300) s levels, the borrowed intensity of 6ν2 (0600), and potential outliers of ν1+ν2+ν4 (1101), etc. These will be the topics in our future work.}

Journal = JQSRT,

Volume = {{277}},
Abstract = {{Room temperature absorption spectra of ammonia have been recorded by
   high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy in the range 3900-4700
   cm(-1) at four pressures (13, 46, 140, and 304 Pa). The investigated
   spectral region overlaps the important 2.3 mu m atmospheric transparency
   window. 8419 absorption lines were retrieved from the recorded spectra.
   Line intensities range between 1 x 10(-25) and 1.6 x 10(-20)
   cm/molecule. The rovibrational assignments, relying on the position and
   intensity agreement with the C2018 theoretical line list (Coles et al.
   2018), were validated by the systematic use of Lower State Combination
   Difference (LSCD) relations. 6052 transitions were assigned to 51
   vibrational bands of the main isotopologue, (NH3)-N-14, and 625
   transitions of the (NH3)-N-15 minor isotopologue were identified.
   Overall, the assigned transitions represent over 99.8\% of the
   integrated absorption at room temperature in the region. The upper state
   empirical energy of a total of 2287 rovibrational levels of (NH3)-N-14
   were derived. Among them, 1870 are newly reported. The achieved quality
   of the LSCD relations indicates that the accuracy of the derived energy
   levels is better than 0.001 cm(-1). Comparison with the HITRAN2020 list
   shows that the present results will be valuable in improving the ammonia
   spectroscopic databases in the region, both in terms of completeness and
   accuracy of the line positions and line intensities. A recommended line
   list for ammonia in natural isotopic abundance is provided for the
   studied region. }},

Journal =PRA,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Abstract = {{Numerous accidental near degeneracies exist between the 2.2 and.4
   rotation-vibration energy levels of ammonia. Transitions between these
   two states possess significantly enhanced sensitivity to a possible
   variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio mu. Using a robust
   variational approach to determine the mass sensitivity of the energy
   levels along with accurate experimental values for the energies,
   sensitivity coefficients have been calculated for over 350 microwave,
   submillimeter, and far-infrared transitions up to J = 15 for (NH3)-N-14.
   The sensitivities are the largest found in ammonia to date. One
   particular transition, although extremely weak, has a sensitivity of T =
   -16 738 and illustrates the huge enhancement that can occur between
   close-lying energy levels. More promising however are a set of
   previously measured transitions with T = -32 to 28. Given the
   astrophysical importance of ammonia, the sensitivities presented here
   confirm that (NH3)-N-14 can be used exclusively to constrain a spatial
   or temporal variation of mu. Thus certain systematic errors which affect
   the ammonia method can be eliminated. For all transitions analyzed we
   provide frequency data and Einstein A coefficients to guide future
   laboratory and astronomical observations.}},

Abstract = {{A general algorithm for computing the quadrupole-hyperfine effects in
   the rovibrational spectra of polyatomic molecules is presented for the
   case of ammonia (NH3). The method extends the general variational
   approach TROVE {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc. 245, 126-140 (2007)] by adding the
   extra term in the Hamiltonian that describes the nuclear quadrupole
   coupling, with no inherent limitation on the number of quadrupolar
   nuclei in a molecule. We applied the new approach to compute the
   nitrogen-nuclear-quadrupole hyperfine structure in the rovibrational
   spectrum of (NH3)-N-14. These results agree very well with recent
   experimental spectroscopic data for the pure rotational transitions in
   the ground vibrational and v(2) states and the rovibrational transitions
   in the v(1), v(3), 2v(4), and v(1) + v(3) bands. The computed

Abstract = {{Sub-Doppler, saturation dip, spectra of lines in the v(1) + v(3), v(1) +
   2v(4), and v(3) + 2v(4) bands of (NH3)-N-14 have been measured by
   frequency comb-referenced diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The
   observed spectral line widths are dominated by transit time broadening
   and show resolved or partially-resolved hyperfine splittings that are
   primarily determined by the N-14 quadrupole coupling. Modeling of the
   observed line shapes based on the known hyperfine level structure of the
   ground state of the molecule shows that, in nearly all cases, the
   excited state level has hyperfine splittings similar to the same
   rotational level in the ground state. The data provide accurate
   frequencies for the line positions and easily separate lines overlapped
   in Doppler-limited spectra. The observed hyperfine splittings can be
   used to make and confirm rotational assignments and ground state
   combination differences obtained from the measured frequencies are
   comparable in accuracy to those obtained from conventional microwave
   spectroscopy. Several of the measured transitions do not show the
   quadrupole hyperfine splittings expected based on their existing

   upper levels involved are perturbed in a way that affects the nuclear

selection rules and the \{HITRAN\} labeling formalisms; the problems identified are corrected where possible. Further assignments are brought into question by 
combination difference (CD) checking of implied upper energy levels. The \{CD\} analysis yields an 89% complete 14NH3 energy level list up to 6610&#xa0;cm−1 and J=21, 
self-consistent to 0.1&#xa0;cm−1. In combination with the 1723 previously unassigned and unlabeled lines in \{HITRAN\} a total of 2529 problem lines were identified for re-analysis. 
The compiled energy level list was used to label and assign the set of problem transitions, resulting in a total of 249 new assignments and a further 368 new labelings. 
Assignment by comparison with the reference line list resulted in 111 further new line assignments and 14 new labelings. Intensities are checked against recent measurements 
and BYTe. New intensities are proposed for the ν 2 band with new intensities and line positions for the 2 ν 2 − ν 2 and new line lists are created for the
 ν 2 − ν 2 , ν 2 − ν 4 and ν 4 − ν 4 bands. \{BYTe\} band intensities are analyzed to identify other regions of missing intensity. "

chamber designed for future slit nozzle experiments, (b) to further our understanding of the characteristics, stability and accuracy of our laser, 
and (c) to investigate the performance of our system by comparison with previous Fourier transform results. The system sensitivity was high and 
yielded an average observed line density of over 13 lines per cm−1, about three times greater than reported before, with numerous weak absorptions clearly visible. 
The lines arise mainly from the perpendicular (ν1+ν3) NH-stretching combination band, plus possibly other combinations with excited ν2 states. 
Transition wavenumbers, absorption coefficients, and line widths were determined. From extrapolation of trends in wavenumber, intensity and
 upper state energy for known transitions, 21 additional assignments are proposed for (ν1+ν3) band lines. The term values, l-doubling and a–s inversion 
splittings for the (ν1+ν3) and 2ν3 (l=0) states in the 1.5 μm region are surveyed. Exploratory fitting was carried out to a linear effective Hamiltonian to

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the significant progress made by an experiment
   dedicated to the determination of the Boltzmann constant, k(B), by
   accurately measuring the Doppler absorption profile of a line in ammonia
   gas at thermal equilibrium. This optical method based on the first
   principles of statistical mechanics is an alternative to the acoustical
   method, which has led to the unique determination of k(B) published by
   the Committee on Data for Science and Technology with a relative
   accuracy of 1.7 x 10(-6). We report on the first measurement of the
   Boltzmann constant carried out by using laser spectroscopy with a
   statistical uncertainty below 10 p.p.m., more specifically 6.4 p.p.m.
   This progress results from the improvement in the detection method and
   in the statistical treatment of the data. In addition, we have recorded
   the hyperfine structure of the probed nu(2) saQ(6,3) rovibrational line
   of ammonia by saturation spectroscopy and thus determine very precisely
   the induced 4.36 (2) p.p.m. broadening of the absorption linewidth. We
   also show that in our well-chosen experimental conditions, saturation
   effects have negligible impact on the linewidth. Finally, we suggest
   directions for future work to achieve an absolute determination of k(B)
   with an accuracy of a few p.p.m.}},
