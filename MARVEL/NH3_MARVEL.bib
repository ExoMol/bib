abstract = "Abstract The data incorporated in the \{HITRAN\} database for 14NH3 are analyzed using a comprehensive and consistent set of quantum numbers,
 empirical lower energy levels and the \{BYTe\} variationally calculated line list as reference points. Labelings are checked to ensure that they obey both the usual 
selection rules and the \{HITRAN\} labeling formalisms; the problems identified are corrected where possible. Further assignments are brought into question by 
combination difference (CD) checking of implied upper energy levels. The \{CD\} analysis yields an 89% complete 14NH3 energy level list up to 6610&#xa0;cm−1 and J=21, 
self-consistent to 0.1&#xa0;cm−1. In combination with the 1723 previously unassigned and unlabeled lines in \{HITRAN\} a total of 2529 problem lines were identified for re-analysis. 
The compiled energy level list was used to label and assign the set of problem transitions, resulting in a total of 249 new assignments and a further 368 new labelings. 
Assignment by comparison with the reference line list resulted in 111 further new line assignments and 14 new labelings. Intensities are checked against recent measurements 
and BYTe. New intensities are proposed for the ν 2 band with new intensities and line positions for the 2 ν 2 − ν 2 and new line lists are created for the
 ν 2 − ν 2 , ν 2 − ν 4 and ν 4 − ν 4 bands. \{BYTe\} band intensities are analyzed to identify other regions of missing intensity. "

abstract = "\{NH3\} absorption spectra have been recorded from 6460 to 6522 cm−1 at room temperature and ∼5.5 Torr pressure with
 an external cavity tunable diode laser. The spectra served (a) as an initial test of a multipass optical assembly mounted in a large vacuum 
chamber designed for future slit nozzle experiments, (b) to further our understanding of the characteristics, stability and accuracy of our laser, 
and (c) to investigate the performance of our system by comparison with previous Fourier transform results. The system sensitivity was high and 
yielded an average observed line density of over 13 lines per cm−1, about three times greater than reported before, with numerous weak absorptions clearly visible. 
The lines arise mainly from the perpendicular (ν1+ν3) NH-stretching combination band, plus possibly other combinations with excited ν2 states. 
Transition wavenumbers, absorption coefficients, and line widths were determined. From extrapolation of trends in wavenumber, intensity and
 upper state energy for known transitions, 21 additional assignments are proposed for (ν1+ν3) band lines. The term values, l-doubling and a–s inversion 
splittings for the (ν1+ν3) and 2ν3 (l=0) states in the 1.5 μm region are surveyed. Exploratory fitting was carried out to a linear effective Hamiltonian to 
assess the extent of off-diagonal interactions and perturbations. "

Fourier Transform Spectrometer at Kitt Peak National Observatory, AZ. The line positions and intensities were retrieved by fitting individual spectra
 based on a Voigt line shape profile and then averaging the values to form the experimental linelist. The integrated intensity of the region 
was 4.68×10−19&#xa0;cm−1/(molecule·cm−2) at 296&#xa0;K. Empirical lower state energies were also estimated for 3567 absorption line 
features using line intensities retrieved from 10 spectra recorded at gas temperature between 185 and 233&#xa0;K. Finally, using Ground State 
Combination Differences (GSCDs) and the empirical lower state energy estimates, the quantum assignments were determined for 1096 transitions 
in the room temperature linelist, along with empirical upper state energies for 434 levels. The assignments correspond to seven vibrational states, 
as confirmed from recent ab initio calculations. The resulting composite database of 14NH3 line parameters will provide experimental constraints to
 ab initio calculations and support remote sensing of gaseous bodies including the atmospheres of Earth, (exo)planets, brown dwarfs, and other astrophysical environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an accurate analysis of the shape of an
   isolated rovibrational ammonia line from the strong v(2) band around 10
   mu m, recorded by laser absorption spectroscopy. Experimental spectra
   obtained under controlled temperature and pressure are confronted to
   various models that take into account Dicke narrowing or speed-dependent
   effects. Our results show a deviation from the Voigt profile probably
   dominated by speed-dependent broadening and shifting. Accurate
   line-shape parameters of the v(2) saQ(6,3) line are obtained. Our
   current project aiming at measuring the Boltzmann constant, k(B), by
   laser spectroscopy will immediately benefit from such knowledge. We
   anticipate that an optical determination of k(B) with a competitive
   uncertainty of a few parts per million is now reachable.}}}

Title = {{Progress towards an accurate determination of the Boltzmann constant by Doppler spectroscopy}},
Journal = NJP,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{13}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the significant progress made by an experiment
   dedicated to the determination of the Boltzmann constant, k(B), by
   accurately measuring the Doppler absorption profile of a line in ammonia
   gas at thermal equilibrium. This optical method based on the first
   principles of statistical mechanics is an alternative to the acoustical
   method, which has led to the unique determination of k(B) published by
   the Committee on Data for Science and Technology with a relative
   accuracy of 1.7 x 10(-6). We report on the first measurement of the
   Boltzmann constant carried out by using laser spectroscopy with a
   statistical uncertainty below 10 p.p.m., more specifically 6.4 p.p.m.
   This progress results from the improvement in the detection method and
   in the statistical treatment of the data. In addition, we have recorded
   the hyperfine structure of the probed nu(2) saQ(6,3) rovibrational line
   of ammonia by saturation spectroscopy and thus determine very precisely
   the induced 4.36 (2) p.p.m. broadening of the absorption linewidth. We
   also show that in our well-chosen experimental conditions, saturation
   effects have negligible impact on the linewidth. Finally, we suggest
   directions for future work to achieve an absolute determination of k(B)
   with an accuracy of a few p.p.m.}},
