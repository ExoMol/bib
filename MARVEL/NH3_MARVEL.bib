abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) holds significant importance as an industrial product, 
   ambient trace pollutant, and a promising zero-carbon energy carrier, underscoring the 
   critical need for accurate quantification in various applications. In this study, 
   a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (Mid-IR QCL) based tunable diode laser absorption 
   spectroscopy (TDLAS) spectrometer was developed. It was coupled with two reactors, namely 
   a gas cell and a shock tube and operated in three modes: low- and high-frequency (140 Hz and 
   10 kHz) scan modes and fixed-wavelength mode, tailored to the specific needs of each 
   experimental scenario. The primary objects were NH3 line parameters measurement and 
   absolute NH3 quantification. With the 140 Hz low-frequency scan mode, NH3-Ar pressure 
   broadening coefficients of six transition lines near 1084.6 cm−1 were measured in a gas 
   cell at 295 K and 1–11 mbar for the first time. These coefficients were subsequently employed 
   to quantify the initial NH3 mole fraction in shock tube experiments, considering the 
   substantial adsorption effect of NH3. Using the high-frequency scan mode (10 kHz), spectrally 
   resolved NH3 absorption cross-sections were obtained in a shock tube across a pressure range 
   of 1.46–3.25 bar and a temperature range of 1000–1800 K. This data, acquired for the first time, 
   significantly contributes to the understanding of NH3 behavior in high-temperature environments. 
   Additionally, potential interference from high-temperature water absorption near 1084.6 cm−1 was 
   thoroughly examined. The high-temperature water absorption cross-section was measured over a 
   pressure range of 0.99–3.02 bar and a temperature range of 1322–2905 K, utilizing a 
   near-infrared water laser. Leveraging these comprehensive datasets, the study quantified the 
   NH3 mole fraction during the NH3 oxidation process in the shock tube, employing the 
   fixed-wavelength mode to achieve high time resolution. The quantified NH3 mole fraction 
   was then compared to predictions from eleven recent chemical kinetic mechanisms, demonstrating 
   the utility of the developed spectrometer in validating these mechanisms.}

abstract = {We present new high-resolution photoabsorption spectra of ammonia spanning the region between 59,000 cm-1 and 93,000 cm-1 that were recorded by using the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the Synchrotron SOLEIL. This region extends from just above the Franck-Condon envelope for the A∼ 1A2“ ← X∼ 1A1' transition to well above the NH3+ X∼+ 2A2” ionization threshold. The spectra were recorded at a measured resolution of 0.23 cm-1 in both a room-temperature cell (293 K) and in a slit-jet supersonic expansion (∼70 K). The absolute photoabsorption cross section with an uncertainty of ±5% is also reported for the room-temperature spectrum. The present resolution is a factor of 10 – 100 times higher than in other recently reported broad band spectra of ammonia, and many of the observed bands show partially resolved rotational structure. We have attempted to assign this structure for a number of these bands. The oscillator strengths extracted from the data are in good agreement with previous measurements but, in the case of structured bands, the present higher resolution measurements return higher peak absorption cross sections, that increase further when the sample is cooled. The present higher resolution spectra suggest that a number of previous vibronic band assignments that were based on quantum defect considerations may require some revision. Finally, we discuss the substantial differences between the photoabsorption and photoionization data just above the first ionization threshold.}

Journal =PRA,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Abstract = {{Numerous accidental near degeneracies exist between the 2.2 and.4
   rotation-vibration energy levels of ammonia. Transitions between these
   two states possess significantly enhanced sensitivity to a possible
   variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio mu. Using a robust
   variational approach to determine the mass sensitivity of the energy
   levels along with accurate experimental values for the energies,
   sensitivity coefficients have been calculated for over 350 microwave,
   submillimeter, and far-infrared transitions up to J = 15 for (NH3)-N-14.
   The sensitivities are the largest found in ammonia to date. One
   particular transition, although extremely weak, has a sensitivity of T =
   -16 738 and illustrates the huge enhancement that can occur between
   close-lying energy levels. More promising however are a set of
   previously measured transitions with T = -32 to 28. Given the
   astrophysical importance of ammonia, the sensitivities presented here
   confirm that (NH3)-N-14 can be used exclusively to constrain a spatial
   or temporal variation of mu. Thus certain systematic errors which affect
   the ammonia method can be eliminated. For all transitions analyzed we
   provide frequency data and Einstein A coefficients to guide future
   laboratory and astronomical observations.}},

Abstract = {{A general algorithm for computing the quadrupole-hyperfine effects in

   approach TROVE {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc. 245, 126-140 (2007)] by adding the
   extra term in the Hamiltonian that describes the nuclear quadrupole
   coupling, with no inherent limitation on the number of quadrupolar
   nuclei in a molecule. We applied the new approach to compute the
   nitrogen-nuclear-quadrupole hyperfine structure in the rovibrational
   spectrum of (NH3)-N-14. These results agree very well with recent
   experimental spectroscopic data for the pure rotational transitions in

   in the v(1), v(3), 2v(4), and v(1) + v(3) bands. The computed

Abstract = {{Sub-Doppler, saturation dip, spectra of lines in the v(1) + v(3), v(1) +

   frequency comb-referenced diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The
   observed spectral line widths are dominated by transit time broadening
   and show resolved or partially-resolved hyperfine splittings that are
   primarily determined by the N-14 quadrupole coupling. Modeling of the
   observed line shapes based on the known hyperfine level structure of the
   ground state of the molecule shows that, in nearly all cases, the
   excited state level has hyperfine splittings similar to the same
   rotational level in the ground state. The data provide accurate
   frequencies for the line positions and easily separate lines overlapped
   in Doppler-limited spectra. The observed hyperfine splittings can be
   used to make and confirm rotational assignments and ground state
   combination differences obtained from the measured frequencies are
   comparable in accuracy to those obtained from conventional microwave
   spectroscopy. Several of the measured transitions do not show the
   quadrupole hyperfine splittings expected based on their existing

abstract = "Abstract The data incorporated in the \{HITRAN\} database for 14NH3 are analyzed using a comprehensive and consistent set of quantum numbers,
 empirical lower energy levels and the \{BYTe\} variationally calculated line list as reference points. Labelings are checked to ensure that they obey both the usual 
selection rules and the \{HITRAN\} labeling formalisms; the problems identified are corrected where possible. Further assignments are brought into question by 
combination difference (CD) checking of implied upper energy levels. The \{CD\} analysis yields an 89% complete 14NH3 energy level list up to 6610&#xa0;cm−1 and J=21, 
self-consistent to 0.1&#xa0;cm−1. In combination with the 1723 previously unassigned and unlabeled lines in \{HITRAN\} a total of 2529 problem lines were identified for re-analysis. 
The compiled energy level list was used to label and assign the set of problem transitions, resulting in a total of 249 new assignments and a further 368 new labelings. 
Assignment by comparison with the reference line list resulted in 111 further new line assignments and 14 new labelings. Intensities are checked against recent measurements 
and BYTe. New intensities are proposed for the ν 2 band with new intensities and line positions for the 2 ν 2 − ν 2 and new line lists are created for the
 ν 2 − ν 2 , ν 2 − ν 4 and ν 4 − ν 4 bands. \{BYTe\} band intensities are analyzed to identify other regions of missing intensity. "

abstract = "\{NH3\} absorption spectra have been recorded from 6460 to 6522 cm−1 at room temperature and ∼5.5 Torr pressure with
 an external cavity tunable diode laser. The spectra served (a) as an initial test of a multipass optical assembly mounted in a large vacuum 
chamber designed for future slit nozzle experiments, (b) to further our understanding of the characteristics, stability and accuracy of our laser, 
and (c) to investigate the performance of our system by comparison with previous Fourier transform results. The system sensitivity was high and 
yielded an average observed line density of over 13 lines per cm−1, about three times greater than reported before, with numerous weak absorptions clearly visible. 
The lines arise mainly from the perpendicular (ν1+ν3) NH-stretching combination band, plus possibly other combinations with excited ν2 states. 
Transition wavenumbers, absorption coefficients, and line widths were determined. From extrapolation of trends in wavenumber, intensity and
 upper state energy for known transitions, 21 additional assignments are proposed for (ν1+ν3) band lines. The term values, l-doubling and a–s inversion 
splittings for the (ν1+ν3) and 2ν3 (l=0) states in the 1.5 μm region are surveyed. Exploratory fitting was carried out to a linear effective Hamiltonian to 
assess the extent of off-diagonal interactions and perturbations. "

Fourier Transform Spectrometer at Kitt Peak National Observatory, AZ. The line positions and intensities were retrieved by fitting individual spectra
 based on a Voigt line shape profile and then averaging the values to form the experimental linelist. The integrated intensity of the region 
was 4.68×10−19&#xa0;cm−1/(molecule·cm−2) at 296&#xa0;K. Empirical lower state energies were also estimated for 3567 absorption line 
features using line intensities retrieved from 10 spectra recorded at gas temperature between 185 and 233&#xa0;K. Finally, using Ground State 
Combination Differences (GSCDs) and the empirical lower state energy estimates, the quantum assignments were determined for 1096 transitions 
in the room temperature linelist, along with empirical upper state energies for 434 levels. The assignments correspond to seven vibrational states, 
as confirmed from recent ab initio calculations. The resulting composite database of 14NH3 line parameters will provide experimental constraints to
 ab initio calculations and support remote sensing of gaseous bodies including the atmospheres of Earth, (exo)planets, brown dwarfs, and other astrophysical environments.}},

Abstract = {{We report the coherent phase-locking of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) at
   10-mu m to the secondary frequency standard of this spectral region, a
   CO2 laser stabilized on a saturated absorption line of OsO4. The
   stability and accuracy of the standard are transferred to the QCL
   resulting in a line width of the order of 10 Hz, and leading to the
   narrowest QCL to date. The locked QCL is then used to perform absorption
   spectroscopy spanning 6 GHz of NH3 and methyltrioxorhenium, two species
   of interest for applications in precision measurements. }},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an accurate analysis of the shape of an
   isolated rovibrational ammonia line from the strong v(2) band around 10
   mu m, recorded by laser absorption spectroscopy. Experimental spectra
   obtained under controlled temperature and pressure are confronted to
   various models that take into account Dicke narrowing or speed-dependent
   effects. Our results show a deviation from the Voigt profile probably
   dominated by speed-dependent broadening and shifting. Accurate
   line-shape parameters of the v(2) saQ(6,3) line are obtained. Our
   current project aiming at measuring the Boltzmann constant, k(B), by
   laser spectroscopy will immediately benefit from such knowledge. We
   anticipate that an optical determination of k(B) with a competitive
   uncertainty of a few parts per million is now reachable.}},

Title = {{Progress towards an accurate determination of the Boltzmann constant by Doppler spectroscopy}},
Journal = NJP,
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the significant progress made by an experiment
   dedicated to the determination of the Boltzmann constant, k(B), by
   accurately measuring the Doppler absorption profile of a line in ammonia
   gas at thermal equilibrium. This optical method based on the first
   principles of statistical mechanics is an alternative to the acoustical
   method, which has led to the unique determination of k(B) published by
   the Committee on Data for Science and Technology with a relative
   accuracy of 1.7 x 10(-6). We report on the first measurement of the
   Boltzmann constant carried out by using laser spectroscopy with a
   statistical uncertainty below 10 p.p.m., more specifically 6.4 p.p.m.
   This progress results from the improvement in the detection method and
   in the statistical treatment of the data. In addition, we have recorded
   the hyperfine structure of the probed nu(2) saQ(6,3) rovibrational line
   of ammonia by saturation spectroscopy and thus determine very precisely
   the induced 4.36 (2) p.p.m. broadening of the absorption linewidth. We
   also show that in our well-chosen experimental conditions, saturation
   effects have negligible impact on the linewidth. Finally, we suggest
   directions for future work to achieve an absolute determination of k(B)
   with an accuracy of a few p.p.m.}},

The 15NH3 line list is based on the same computational procedure used for the line list for 14NH3 \{BYTe\} reported recently and should be as accurate. Comparisons with experimental frequencies and intensities are presented. The synthetic spectra show excellent agreement with experimental spectra. ",
