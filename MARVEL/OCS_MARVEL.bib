Abstract = {We describe a precision sub-Doppler millimeter and submillimeter-wave
   Lamb-dip spectrometer with a backward-wave oscillator as the radiation
   source. The effect of nonlinear saturation of the spectral transitions
   (the Lamb-dip method) is used. The spectrometer resolution (about 5-10
   kHz) and the measurement accuracy of the absolute frequencies (of the
   order of 1 kHz) of molecular transitions in the frequency range below
   0.5 THz are discussed. The spectrometer is designed for obtaining
   accurate radio-astronomy and molecular-spectroscopy experimental data,
   in particular, when seeking variation in the proton-to-electron mass
   ratio as a function of time and place in the Universe. The frequency
   records of the Lamb dips on the spectral lines of the CO, OCS, and H2O
   molecules, the results of measuring the center frequencies of some
   transitions, and comparison with the results of other works are
   presented. The high measurement accuracy allows us to use the
   molecular-transition frequencies as the secondary frequency standards.},

Both measured and predicted transition frequencies are listed for several isotopic forms of HCN, H2O, H2S, OCS, SO2, and O3. The derived molecular properties, such as rotational and centrifugal distortion constants, hyperfine structure constants, electric dipole moments, and rotational g‐factors are listed with one standard deviation uncertainty for all values.}",

Title = {{Spatially-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy of Venus 2. Variations
   of HDO, OCS, and SO$_2$ at the cloud tops}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {209},
Pages = {314-322},
Abstract = {While CO, HCl, and HF, that were considered in the first part of this
   work, have distinct absorption lines in high-resolution spectra and were
   detected four decades ago, the lines of HDO, OCS, and SO2 are either
   very weak or blended by the telluric lines and have not been observed
   previously by ground-based infrared spectroscopy at the Venus cloud
   tops. The H2O abundance above the Venus clouds is typically below the
   detection limit of ground-based IR spectroscopy. However, the large D/H
   ratio on Venus facilitates observations of HDO. Converted to H2O with
   D/H approximate to 200, our observations at 2722 cm(-1) in the Venus
   afternoon show a H2O mixing ratio of similar to 1.2 ppm at latitudes
   between +/- 40 degrees increasing to +/- 60 degrees by a factor of 2.
   The observations in the early morning reveal the H2O mixing ratio that
   is almost constant at 2.9 ppm within latitudes of +/- 75 degrees. The
   measured H2O mixing ratios refer to 74 km. The observed increase in H2O
   is explained by the lack of photochemical production of sulfuric acid in
   the night time. The recent observations at the P-branch of OCS at 4094
   cm(-1) confirm our detection of OCS. Four distributions of OCS along the
   disk of Venus at various latitudes and local times have been retrieved.
   Both regular and irregular components are present in the variations of
   OCS. The observed OCS mixing ratio at 65 km varies from similar to 0.3
   to 9 ppb with the mean value of similar to 3 ppb. The OCS scale height
   is retrieved from the observed limb darkening and varies from 1 to 4 km
   with a mean value of half the atmospheric scale height. SO2 at the cloud
   tops has been detected for the first time by means of ground-based
   infrared spectroscopy. The SO2 lines look irregular in the observed
   spectra at 2476 cm(-1). The SO2 abundances are retrieved by fitting by
   synthetic spectra, and two methods have been applied to determine
   uncertainties and detection limits in this fitting. The retrieved mean
   SO2 mixing ratio of 350 +/- 50 ppb at 72 km favors a significant
   increase in SO2 above the clouds since the period of 1980-1995 that was
   observed by the SOIR occultations at Venus Express. Scale heights of OCS
   and SO2 may be similar, and the SO2/OCS ratio is similar to 500 and may
   be rather stable at 65-70 km under varying conditions on Venus.},

abstract = {Abstract Interest in stratospheric aerosol and its role in climate have increased over the last decade due to the observed increase in stratospheric aerosol since 2000 and the potential for changes in the sulfur cycle induced by climate change. This review provides an overview about the advances in stratospheric aerosol research since the last comprehensive assessment of stratospheric aerosol was published in 2006. A crucial development since 2006 is the substantial improvement in the agreement between in situ and space-based inferences of stratospheric aerosol properties during volcanically quiescent periods. Furthermore, new measurement systems and techniques, both in situ and space based, have been developed for measuring physical aerosol properties with greater accuracy and for characterizing aerosol composition. However, these changes induce challenges to constructing a long-term stratospheric aerosol climatology. Currently, changes in stratospheric aerosol levels less than 20\% cannot be confidently quantified. The volcanic signals tend to mask any nonvolcanically driven change, making them difficult to understand. While the role of carbonyl sulfide as a substantial and relatively constant source of stratospheric sulfur has been confirmed by new observations and model simulations, large uncertainties remain with respect to the contribution from anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions. New evidence has been provided that stratospheric aerosol can also contain small amounts of nonsulfate matter such as black carbon and organics. Chemistry-climate models have substantially increased in quantity and sophistication. In many models the implementation of stratospheric aerosol processes is coupled to radiation and/or stratospheric chemistry modules to account for relevant feedback processes.},

Journal = {Nature Astron.},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Pages = {986-993},
Abstract = {Laboratory experiments show that the inclusion of even small quantities
   of sulfur in the atmospheres of exoplanets at 800 K significantly
   increases photochemical complexity, both in the vapour and in the solid
   phase: many sulfur gas products are created (including potential
   biosignature gases) and the production of organic haze particles
   increases threefold.
   Sulfur gases substantially affect the photochemistry of planetary
   atmospheres in our Solar System, and are expected to be important
   components in exoplanet atmospheres. However, sulfur photochemistry in
   the context of exoplanets is poorly understood due to a lack of chemical
   kinetics information for sulfur species under relevant conditions. Here,
   we study the photochemical role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in warm
   CO2-rich exoplanet atmospheres (800 K) by carrying out laboratory
   simulations. We find that H2S plays a prominent role in photochemistry,
   even when present in the atmosphere at relatively low concentrations
   (1.6\%). It participates in both gas and solid phase chemistry, leading
   to the formation of other sulfur gas products (CH3SH/SO, C2H4S/OCS,
   SO2/S-2 and CS2) and to an increase in solid haze particle production
   and compositional complexity. Our study shows that we may expect thicker
   haze with small particle sizes (20-140 nm) for warm CO2-rich exoplanet
   atmospheres that possess H2S.},

Title = {Organic Haze as a Biosignature in Anoxic Earth-like Atmospheres},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {311-329},
Abstract = {Early Earth may have hosted a biologically mediated global organic haze
   during the Archean eon (3.8-2.5 billion years ago). This haze would have
   significantly impacted multiple aspects of our planet, including its
   potential for habitability and its spectral appearance. Here, we model
   worlds with Archean-like levels of carbon dioxide orbiting the ancient
   Sun and an M4V dwarf (GJ 876) and show that organic haze formation
   requires methane fluxes consistent with estimated Earth-like biological
   production rates. On planets with high fluxes of biogenic organic sulfur
   gases (CS2, OCS, CH3SH, and CH3SCH3), photochemistry involving these
   gases can drive haze formation at lower CH4/CO2 ratios than methane
   photochemistry alone. For a planet orbiting the Sun, at 30x the modern
   organic sulfur gas flux, haze forms at a CH4/CO2 ratio 20\% lower than
   at 1x the modern organic sulfur flux. For a planet orbiting the M4V
   star, the impact of organic sulfur gases is more pronounced: at 1x the
   modern Earth organic sulfur flux, a substantial haze forms at CH4/CO2
   approximate to 0.2, but at 30x the organic sulfur flux, the CH4/CO2
   ratio needed to form haze decreases by a full order of magnitude.
   Detection of haze at an anomalously low CH4/CO2 ratio could suggest the
   influence of these biogenic sulfur gases and therefore imply biological
   activity on an exoplanet. When these organic sulfur gases are not
   readily detectable in the spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet, the thick
   organic haze they can help produce creates a very strong absorption
   feature at UV-blue wavelengths detectable in reflected light at a
   spectral resolution as low as 10. In direct imaging, constraining CH4
   and CO2 concentrations will require higher spectral resolution, and
   R>170 is needed to accurately resolve the structure of the CO2 feature
   at 1.57m, likely the most accessible CO2 feature on an Archean-like
   exoplanet. Key Words: Organic hazeOrganic sulfur

Title = {Using Biogenic Sulfur Gases as Remotely Detectable Biosignatures on
   Anoxic Planets},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {419-441},
Abstract = {We used one-dimensional photochemical and radiative transfer models to
   study the potential of organic sulfur compounds (CS2, OCS, CH3SH,
   CH3SCH3, and CH3S2CH3) to act as remotely detectable biosignatures in
   anoxic exoplanetary atmospheres. Concentrations of organic sulfur gases
   were predicted for various biogenic sulfur fluxes into anoxic
   atmospheres and were found to increase with decreasing UV fluxes.
   Dimethyl sulfide (CH3SCH3, or DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (CH3S2CH3, or
   DMDS) concentrations could increase to remotely detectable levels, but
   only in cases of extremely low UV fluxes, which may occur in the
   habitable zone of an inactive M dwarf. The most detectable feature of
   organic sulfur gases is an indirect one that results from an increase in
   ethane (C2H6) over that which would be predicted based on the planet's
   methane (CH4) concentration. Thus, a characterization mission could
   detect these organic sulfur gases-and therefore the life that produces
   them-if it could sufficiently quantify the ethane and methane in the
   exoplanet's atmosphere.},
