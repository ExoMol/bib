The calculation of equivalent widths using several sunspot models (all of which can satisfy the observed data) shows that the logarithmic optical depth at the effective layer of molecular line formation is about -1.6.},

	(1) absolute brightnesses corresponding to theoretical masses of
	0.080-0.083 M. and 0.079-0.080 M. for the faint pair, depending mainly
	on their age and metallicity; (2) a saturation of the optical TiO

	formation, and (3) emission lines typical of moderate chromospheric
	activity in only the two most massive components. Li I lines are
	not seen. But also all other lines of the alkali elements are remakably
	weak or even absent in the two faint companions B and C. This appears
	to be an effect of dust formation. Comparison of the observations

	Abstract = {We present synthetic optical spectra in the red and far-red (640-930
	nm) of a sample of field L dwarfs suitably selected to cover this
	new spectral class, and the brown dwarf GL 229B. We have used the
	recent ``dusty{''} atmospheres by Tsuji (2000) and by Allard(1999),
	and a synthesis code (Pavlenko et al. 1995) working under LTE conditions
	which considers the chemical equilibrium of more than 100 molecular
	species and the detailed opacities for the most relevant bands. Our
	computations show that the alkali elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs
	govern the optical spectra of the objects in our sample, with Na
	and K contributing significantly to block the optical emergent radiation.
	Molecular absorption bands of oxides (TiO and VO) and hydrides (CrH,
	Fell and CaH) also dominate at these wavelengths in the early L-types
	showing a strength that progressively decreases for later types.
	We find that the densities of these molecules in the atmospheres
	of our objects are considerably smaller by larger factors than those
	predicted by chemical equilibrium considerations. This is consistent
	with Ti and V atoms being depleted into grains of dust. In order
	to reproduce the overall shape of the optical spectra of our observations
	an additional opacity is required to be implemented in the computations.
	We have modelled it with a simple law of the form a(o) (nu/nu(o))(N),
	With N = 4, and found that this provides a sufficiently good fit
	to the data. This additional opacity could be due to molecular/dust
	absorption or to dust scattering. We remark that the equivalent widths
	and intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity.
	In particular, the lithium resonance line at 670.8 nm, which is widely
	used as a substellarity discriminator, is more affected by the additional
	opacity than by the natural depletion of neutral lithium atoms into
	molecular species. Our theoretical spectra displays a rather strong
	resonance feature even at very cool effective temperatures (similar
	to 1000 K); depending on the effective temperature and on the amount
	of dust in the atmospheres of very cool dwarfs, it might be possible
	to achieve the detection of lithium even at temperatures this cool.
	Changes in the physical conditions governing dust formation in L-type
	objects will cause variability of the alkali lines, particularly
	of the shorter wavelength lines.},

	Clouds using VLT+XSHOOTER, and we fit MARCS model atmospheres to
	different regions of the spectra, deriving effective temperatures
	for each star from (1) the TiO bands, (2) line-free continuum regions
	of the SEDs, and (3) the integrated fluxes. We show that the temperatures
	derived from fits to the TiO bands are systematically lower than
	the other two methods by several hundred kelvin. The TiO fits also
	dramatically overpredict the flux in the near-IR, and imply extinctions
	which are anomalously low compared to neighboring stars. In contrast,
	the SED temperatures provide good fits to the fluxes at all wavelengths
	other than the TiO bands, are in agreement with the temperatures
	from the flux integration method, and imply extinctions consistent
	with nearby stars. After considering a number of ways to reconcile
	this discrepancy, we conclude that three-dimensional effects (i.e.,
	granulation) are the most likely cause, as they affect the temperature
	structure in the upper layers where the TiO lines form. The continuum,
	however, which forms at much deeper layers, is apparently more robust

@article{15HoDeSn.TiO,
	Abstract = {{Context. The spectral signature of an exoplanet can be separated from
   the spectrum of its host star using high-resolution spectroscopy. During
   these observations, the radial component of the planet's orbital
   velocity changes, resulting in a significant Doppler shift that allows
   its spectral features to be extracted.
   Aims. In this work, we aim to detect TiO in the optical transmission
   spectrum of HD 209458b. Gaseous TiO has been suggested as the cause of
   the thermal inversion layer invoked to explain the dayside spectrum of
   this planet.
   Methods. We used archival data from the 8.2 m Subaru telescope taken
   with the High Dispersion Spectrograph of a transit of HD209458b in 2002.
   We created model transmission spectra that include absorption by TiO,
   and cross-correlated them with the residual spectral data after removal
   of the dominating stellar absorption features. We subsequently co-added
   the correlation signal in time, taking the change in Doppler shift due
   to the orbit of the planet into account.
   Results. We detect no significant cross-correlation signal due to TiO,
   though artificial injection of our template spectra into the data
   indicates a sensitivity down to a volume-mixing ratio of similar to
   10(-10). However, cross-correlating the template spectra with a HARPS
   spectrum of Barnard's star yields only a weak wavelength-dependent
   correlation, even though Barnard's star is an M4V dwarf that exhibits
   clear TiO absorption. We infer that the TiO line list poorly matches the
   real positions of TiO lines at spectral resolutions of similar to 100
   000. Similar line lists are also used in the PHOENIX and Kurucz stellar
   atmosphere suites and we show that their synthetic M-dwarf spectra also
   correlate poorly with the HARPS spectra of Barnard's star and five other
   M dwarfs. We conclude that the lack of an accurate TiO line list is
   currently critically hampering this high-resolution retrieval technique.}},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic catalog of the 1564 brightest (J < 9) M
	dwarf candidates in the northern sky, as selected from the SUPERBLINK
	proper motion catalog. Observations confirm 1408 of the candidates
	to be late-K and M dwarfs with spectral subtypes K7-M6. From the
	low (? > 40 mas yr?1) proper motion limit and high level of completeness
	of the SUPERBLINK catalog in that magnitude range, we estimate that
	our spectroscopic census most likely includes >90% of all existing,
	northern-sky M dwarfs with apparent magnitude J < 9. Only 682 stars
	in our sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3);
	most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented
	here for the first time. Spectral subtypes are assigned based on
	spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands; a comparison
	of spectra from the same stars obtained at different observatories,
	however, reveals that spectral band index measurements are dependent
	on spectral resolution, spectrophotometric calibration, and other
	instrumental factors. As a result, we find that a consistent classification
	scheme requires that spectral indices be calibrated and corrected
	for each observatory/instrument used. After systematic corrections
	and a recalibration of the subtype-index relationships for the CaH2,
	CaH3, TiO5, and TiO6 spectral indices, we find that we can consistently
	and reliably classify all our stars to a half-subtype precision.
	The use of corrected spectral indices further requires us to recalibrate
	the ? parameter, a metallicity indicator based on the ratio of TiO
	and CaH optical bandheads. However, we find that our ? values are
	not sensitive enough to diagnose metallicity variations in dwarfs
	of subtypes M2 and earlier (?0.5 dex accuracy) and are only marginally
	useful at later M3-M5 subtypes (?0.2 dex accuracy). Fits of our spectra
	to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective
	temperatures. These suggest the existence of a plateau in the M1-M3
	subtype range, in agreement with model fits of infrared spectra but
	at odds with photometric determinations of T eff. Existing geometric
	parallax measurements are extracted from the literature for 624 stars,
	and are used to determine spectroscopic and photometric distances
	for all the other stars. Active dwarfs are identified from measurements
	of H? equivalent widths, and we find a strong correlation between
	H? emission in M dwarfs and detected X-ray emission from ROSAT and/or
	a large UV excess in the GALEX point source catalog. We combine proper
	motion data and photometric distances to evaluate the (U, V, W) distribution
	in velocity space, which is found to correlate tightly with the velocity
	distribution of G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. However, active
	stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which
	is consistent with those stars being younger on average. Our catalog
	will be most useful to guide the selection of the best M dwarf targets
	for exoplanet searches, in particular those using high-precision
	radial velocity measurements.},

@article{09SpSiBu.TiO,
	Abstract = {Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observations indicate that several
	transiting extrasolar giant planets have thermal inversions in their
	upper atmospheres. Above a relative minimum, the temperature appears
	to increase with altitude. Such an inversion probably requires a
	species at high altitude that absorbs a significant amount of incident
	optical/UV radiation. Some authors have suggested that the strong
	optical absorbers titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) could
	provide the needed additional opacity, but if regions of the atmosphere
	are cold enough for Ti and V to be sequestered into solids they might
	rain out and be severely depleted. With a model of the vertical distribution
	of a refractory species in gaseous and condensed form, we address
	the question of whether enough TiO (or VO) could survive aloft in
	an irradiated planet's atmosphere to produce a thermal inversion.
	We find that it is unlikely that VO could play a critical role in
	producing thermal inversions. Furthermore, we find that macroscopic
	mixing is essential to the TiO hypothesis; without macroscopic mixing,
	such a heavy species cannot persist in a planet's upper atmosphere.
	The amount of macroscopic mixing that is required depends on the
	size of condensed titanium-bearing particles that form in regions
	of an atmosphere that are too cold for gaseous TiO to exist. We parameterize
	the macroscopic mixing with the eddy diffusion coefficient K(zz)
	and find, as a function of particle size a, the values that K(zz)
	must assume on the highly irradiated planets HD 209458b, HD 149026b,
	TrES-4, and OGLE-TR-56b to loft enough titanium to the upper atmosphere
	for the TiO hypothesis to be correct. On these planets, we find that
	for TiO to be responsible for thermal inversions K(zz) must be at
	least a few times 10(7) cm(2) s(-1), even for a = 0.1 mu m, and increases
	to nearly 10(11) cm(2) s(-1) for a = 10 mu m. Such large values may
	be problematic for the TiO hypothesis, but are not impossible.},

@article{99JoVaKo.TiO,
	Abstract = {We examine several theories that describe how stellar magnetic fields
	on classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) interact with their surrounding
	accretion disks. We demonstrate that these theories require magnetic
	field strengths ranging from a few hundred to several thousand gauss,
	depending on which model is used and more importantly on the properties
	of individual systems. For example, the CTTS BP Tau is predicted
	to have a relatively strong magnetic field (1.4-4.1 kG), which should
	be detectable. We present infrared (IR) and optical echelle spectra
	of BP Tau and several reference stars of similar spectral class.
	Using detailed spectrum synthesis and the latest model atmospheres,
	we fitted 12 absorption features in the optical spectrum, including
	the strong titanium oxide (TiO) band head at 7055 Angstrom. For BP
	Tau we determine key stellar parameters: effective temperature (T(eff)
	= 4055 +/- 112 K), gravity (log g = 3.67 +/- 0.50), metallicity ({[}M/H]
	= 0.18 +/- 0.11), projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 10.2 +/-
	1.8 km s(-1)), and optical veiling (r = 0.00-0.15). A similar analysis
	of 61 Cyg B (K7 V) is used to validate the methodology, We then use
	the IR spectra to look for Zeeman broadening, which has a more pronounced
	effect at longer wavelengths. A Zeeman sensitive Ti I line at 2.2233
	mu m appears significantly broadened in BP Tau, relative to several
	rotationally broadened standard stars. The observed line is also
	significantly broader than predictions based on our optical analysis.
	Interpreting this excess broadening as Zeeman splitting of the Ti
	I line, we fitted the spectrum and find a distribution of field strengths
	whose surface averaged mean is (B) over bar = 2.6 +/- 0.3 kG. We
	did not use the Zeeman sensitive Fe I line at 8468.4 Angstrom when
	determining stellar or magnetic parameters for BP Tau, so this line
	provides a test of our results. The observed line profile is indeed
	broader than the nonmagnetic prediction, but the 8468.4 Angstrom
	line gives a magnetic flux lower than what was obtained in the IR,
	perhaps indicating that strong fields are concentrated into cool
	spots. Finally, we investigate an ad hoc model in which the IR line
	is assumed to form in the accretion disk itself. We discuss several
	reasons why the magnetic model is preferred, but the disk atmosphere
	example illustrates that our magnetic field measurement must still
	be tested using several IR lines with a range of Zeeman sensitivities.},

	by the EROS 2 proper-motion survey. We introduce a scheme for L dwarf
	classification that is based on an extension to cooler spectra of
	a pseudocontinuum ratio previously defined for M dwarfs. For calibrating
	the spectral subclasses, we use a temperature scale for late-M and
	L dwarfs recently obtained by Basri et al, from synthetic spectrum
	fitting of high-resolution profiles of Cs I and Rb I resonance lines.
	We define that the subclass range from LO to L6 corresponds to the
	temperature range from 2200 K to 1600 K. Our subclasses L0, L1, and
	L2 agree with recent findings by Kirkpatrick et al., but then they
	diverge such that our L6 is equivalent to their L8. We find that

	ever seen in any cool dwarf. We do not detect H(alpha) emission in

	regimes. The disk and halo sequences are compared to the predictions
	of the latest model atmospheres and structural models. We find good
	agreement between observation and theory except for known problems
	in the V and H passbands, probably due to incomplete molecular data

	well matched by the models since oxide opacity sources are less important
	in this case. The known extreme M subdwarfs have metallicities about

	and M dwarf model atmospheres can be used to reproduce an R = 120,000
	optical spectrum of the relatively inactive star Gliese 725B (M3.5
	V). We find that tabulated TiO wavelengths have errors large enough
	to complicate line identification, especially for transitions involving
	higher vibrational states. We determine empirical wavelength corrections
	for 12 strong gamma-bands near 6680 and 7090 Angstrom. For the sequence
	of orbital quantum numbers, J, within any one of these bands, our
	observations confirm the predicted line spacing, thereby validating
	the rotational constants for low vibrational levels. However, the
	predicted wavelengths have zero-point errors that differ for each
	overlapping band. Next, we compare observed and synthetic spectra
	near 8463 Angstrom, where an epsilon Q(3) 0-0 band head is expected,
	demonstrating that the electronic oscillator strength of 0.014 advocated
	by Jorgensen is too large by at least a factor of 5. This has a minor
	effect on the structure of theoretical model atmospheres. Using our
	empirically corrected TiO wavelengths, we compute a grid of synthetic
	spectra for Allard \& Hauschildt models spanning a range in effective
	temperature (T-eff), surface gravity (log g), and metallicity ({[}M/H]).

	of TiO in general as well as of various parts of the computed TiO
	opacity. Our computation is an extension of, and based on, the thesis
	work by Collins (1975a). The extension includes evaluation of the
	opacity due to all relevant isotopes of TiO and due to the epsilon
	system. Line frequencies and excitation energies of lines in the
	epsilon-system as well as the f-value were computed based on recently
	determined values from laboratory experiments. We find that the epsilon-system
	contributes a significant fraction of the heating caused by TiO in
	stellar atmospheres, whereas a detailed treatment of all the isotopic
	systems were found to be of less importance for the stellar structure.
	On the other hand, the isotopes affect the synthetic spectra, and
	their main importance is for such calculations. We find that TiO

	Abstract = {Infrared IJHK photometry is presented for 322 red dwarf stars. The
	photometry has an estimated mean error of 3\% and has been taken
	mainly from the literature. Where available, optical UBVR and infrared
	LL'M photometry is also given. Stars with optical spectra available
	are classified using the TiO and VO bands. The spectra and published
	measures of H-alpha widths are used to identify stars with chromospheric
	activity. Space motions are calculated for stars with radial velocities,
	proper motions, and trigonometric parallaxes, and used to estimate
	kinematic population. Binary systems, implied by variable radial
	velocity measurements or reported in infrared imaging searches, are
	noted. The kinematic information allows us to identify metallicity
	effects in the infrared color:color diagrams. Metallicity variations
	lead to changes in the H- continuum opacity, and in the strength
	of the water vapor bands, which are clearly demonstrated in the infrared
	photometry. Nonintuitively, the water band absorption strength increases
	with decreasing metallicity. These opacity effects are used to group
	the stars into five metal-rich to metal-poor categories, ranging
	from young disk to halo. The photometric errors account for an uncertainty
	in this metallicity scheme of one class. As has been found previously,
	there is not an exact correspondence between metallicity and space
	motion, although trends are clear. Absolute magnitudes are determined
	for single stars with good quality trigonometric parallaxes, and
	infrared photometric parallax relations are derived for each metallicity
	group. The position of emission-line stars in the absolute-magnitude:color
	diagrams, and the frequency of chromospheric activity, are consistent
	with current ideas associating activity with either relative ``youth{''}
	or with the presence of a companion. For young disk, old disk, and
	halo low-mass stars, we use the relatively metal-independent I -
	J as the primary temperature classifier, and give intrinsic, colors,
	spectral types and absolute magnitudes. These results will be useful
	for other observational studies and should also be used to constrain

	Abstract = {We report moderate resolution spectroscopy of an unusual late-type,
	faint (I almost-equal-to 20m), emission-line star, PC 0025 + 0447.
	This object was discovered as part of a grism survey for high redshift
	quasars; the very strong (> 250 angstrom equivalent width) H-alpha
	emission line was detected by our automated line search algorithm.
	The spectrum has two unresolved emission lines (H-alpha and H-beta)
	near zero velocity, superposed on the absorption spectrum of a very
	red M dwarf which has strong K I, the strongest VO bands known, and
	relatively weak bands of TiO. The weakness of subordinate lines of
	Na I (lambda-8192) and other spectral features suggest that it is
	definitely a cooler, and probably fainter, analog of LHS 2924. The
	strength of the emission lines indicates that PC 0025 + 0447 is very
	young; it may be a fading, predecessor brown dwarf at an estimated
	M(bol) approaching 14m at a distance of almost-equal-to 60 pc.},

	Abstract = {Four new bands have been observed in the TiO spectrum at 5326.9 Angstrom,
	5358.2 Angstrom, 5389.6 Angstrom and 5422.0 Angstrom and have been
	shown to belong to the 1-0 sequence of the ? system (c 1 ?-a 1 ?).
	The following constants have been calculated for the system (all
	in cm -1 ): T e ' - T e '' = 17 890.5, ? e ' = 916.7, ? e x e ' =
	4.3 3 , ? e '' = 1016.3, ? e x e '' = 3.9 3 . Morse potential Franck-Condon
	factors have been computed for the c 1 ?-a 1 ?, b 1 ?-a 1 ? and b
	1 ?-d 1 ? systems and the theoretical intensity distributions for
	each system calculated. Measured relative integrated intensities
	of the ? system compared well with theoretical values calculated
	from the Franck-Condon factors and confirm the identification of
	the new bands. Expected positions of unobserved sequences of each
	system are indicated and tentative assignments have been made for
	some previously unidentified bands},
