	Abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
	(MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24
	(!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	(CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed. },

	Abstract = {Developments during the last two decades in nuclear motion theory
	made it possible to obtain variational solutions to the time-independent,
	nuclear-motion Schrodinger equation of polyatomic systems as ``exact''
	as the potential energy surface (PES) is. Nuclear motion theory thus
	reached a level whereby this branch of quantum chemistry started
	to catch up with the well developed and widely applied other branch,
	electronic structure theory. It seems to be fair to declare that
	we are now in the fourth age of quantum chemistry, where the first
	three ages are principally defined by developments in electronic
	structure techniques (G. Richards, Nature, 1979, 278, 507). In the
	fourth age we are able to incorporate into our quantum chemical treatment
	the motion of nuclei in an exact fashion and, for example, go beyond
	equilibrium molecular properties and compute accurate, temperature-dependent,
	effective properties, thus closing the gap between measurements and
	electronic structure computations. In this Perspective three fundamental
	algorithms for the variational solution of the time-independent nuclear-motion
	Schrodinger equation employing exact kinetic energy operators are
	presented: one based on tailor-made Hamiltonians, one on the Eckart-Watson
	Hamiltonian, and one on a general internal-coordinate Hamiltonian.
	It is argued that the most useful and most widely applicable procedure
	is the third one, based on a Hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy
	operator written in terms of internal coordinates and an arbitrary
	embedding of the body-fixed frame of the molecule. This Hamiltonian
	makes it feasible to treat the nuclear motions of arbitrary quantum
	systems, irrespective of whether they exhibit a single well-defined
	minimum or not, and of arbitrary reduced-dimensional models. As a
	result, molecular spectroscopy, an important field for the application
	of nuclear motion theory, has almost black-box-type tools at its
	disposal. Variational nuclear motion computations, based on an exact
	kinetic energy operator and an arbitrary PES, can now be performed
	for about 9 active vibrational degrees of freedom relatively straightforwardly.
	Simulations of high-resolution spectra allow the understanding of
	complete rotational-vibrational spectra up to and beyond the first
	dissociation limits. Variational results obtained for H2O, H-3(+),
	NH3, CH4, and H2CCO are used to demonstrate the power of the variational
	techniques for the description of vibrational and rotational excitations.
	Some qualitative features of the results are also discussed.},

@article{92FuLixx.method,
	Abstract = {{The correlated k-distribution method for radiative transfer in nonhomogeneous
	atmospheres is discussed in terms of the physical and mathematical
	conditions under which this method is valid. Two correlated conditions
	are necessary and sufficient for the exact transformation of the
	wavenumber integration to an integration over the cumulative probability
	(g), a monotonically increasing and smooth function in the absorption
	coefficient space. These conditions involve the use of a reference
	condition to define the absorption coefficient and an assumption
	concerning the ordering of the absorption coefficient. The correlated
	conditions are exact in the context of a single line, periodic lines,
	and the strong- and weak-line limits. In realistic atmospheres, these
	assumptions am best for adjacent levels but produce increasing blurring
	or deviations for distant levels. We investigate the blurring of
	the correlated assumptions on the computations of fluxes and heating
	rates based on ``exact{''} line-by-line results, using a variety
	of atmospheric profiles and spectral intervals containing principal
	absorbing gases. In the thermal infrared, errors in fluxes am less
	than 0.2\% for H2O, CO2, CH4, and N2O, and approximately 2\% for
	O3. Errors in heating rates are less than 0.01 K day-1 for these
	gases below approximately 30 km. Larger errors of approximately 0.1
	K day-1 can occur at some levels above this height. For H2O lines
	in the solar region, errors in fluxes and heating rates are within
	0.05\% and 0.01 K day-1, respectively. Based on numerical experimentation,
	we find that the number of g values ranging from 1 (for weak bands)
	to approximately 10 (for strong bands) are usually sufficient to
	achieve acceptable accuracy for flux and heating rate calculations.
	The correlated k-distribution method differs fundamentally from the
	traditional approach that employs scaling approximations and band
	models to separate height and wavenumber integrations for transmittance
	calculations. The equivalent k values for various gases computed
	from this approach can be directly incorporated in the multiple-scattering
	program involving cloud and aerosol particles.}},

@article{02LaNaxx.method,
	Abstract = {The conformation and dynamical behavior of molecular systems is very
	often advantageously described in terms of physically well-adapted
	curvilinear coordinates. It is rather easy to show that the numerous
	analytical expressions of the kinetic energy operator of a molecular
	system described in terms of n curvilinear coordinates can all be
	transformed into the following more usable expression: (T) over cap=Sigma(ij)f(2)(ij)(q)partial
	derivative(2)/partial derivativeq(i)partial derivativeq(j)+Sigma(i)f(1)(i)(q)partial
	derivative/partial derivativeq(i)+nu(q), where f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q),
	and nu(q) are functions of the curvilinear coordinates q=(...,q(i),...).
	If the advantages of curvilinear coordinates are unquestionable,
	they do have a major drawback: the sometimes awful complexity of
	the analytical expression of the kinetic operator (T) over cap for
	molecular systems with more than five atoms. Therefore, we develop
	an algorithm for computing (T) over cap for a given value of the
	n curvilinear coordinates q. The calculation of the functions f(2)(ij)(q),
	f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) only requires the knowledge of the Cartesian
	coordinates and their derivatives in terms of the n curvilinear coordinates.
	This coordinate transformation (curvilinear-->Cartesian) is very
	easy to perform and is widely used in quantum chemistry codes resorting
	to a Z-matrix to define the curvilinear coordinates. Thus, the functions
	f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) can be evaluated numerically and
	exactly for a given value of q, which makes it possible to propagate
	wavepackets or to simulate the spectra of rather complex systems
	(constrained Hamiltonian). The accuracy of this numerical procedure
	is tested by comparing two calculations of the bending spectrum of
	HCN: the first one, performed by using the present numerical kinetic
	operator procedure, the second one, obtained in previous studies,
	by using an analytical kinetic operator. Finally, the ab initio computation
	of the internal rotation spectrum and wave functions of 2-methylpropanal
	by means of dimensionality reduction, is given as an original application.},

	of the invariant subspaces which, when projected by means of the
	eigenfunction method developed by Chen (1989, Group Representation
	Theory for Physicists Singapore, World Scientific), allow the generation
	of a symmetry adapted basis. The symmetrized functions so obtained
	are further taken as a basis to diagonalize simultaneously a set
	of normal number operators, which provides a set of normal states
	expanded in terms of the symmetry adapted local basis. In this approach
	the normal number operators are generated implicitly from the one
	quantum space through a tensorial formalism. Although the normal
	operators are defined in a harmonic basis, the locality of the basis
	allows the approach to be extended to anharmonic functions. This
	approach has the additional advantage of allowing the elimination
	of the spurious states, a common problem in a local coordinate representation.
	An important advantage of this symmetrization method is that it allows
	generation of a code to analyse any molecular system with a minimum

	Abstract = {{Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core--core
	and core--valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have
	been developed for the second row atoms Al--Ar. Two different optimization
	strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core--valence
	basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard
	correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the
	exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized
	with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence--electron
	correlated calculations, i.e., for the core--core plus core--valence
	correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets,
	which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first
	row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103,
	4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence
	to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set
	limit, the intershell (core--valence) correlation energy converges
	more slowly than the intrashell (core--core) correlation energy.
	Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation
	of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core--valence correlation
	effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions
	was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions
	to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just
	the core--valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a
	small amount of core--core correlation energy was included in order
	to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit.
	These new sets, denoted weighted core--valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ),
	significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties
	with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also
	developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ
	basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations
	on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al2, Si2,
	P2, S2, and Cl2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving
	first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the calculation of core

@article{15Salam.method,
	Abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the fundamental theory describing
	the interaction of electrons and photons. Its characteristic feature
	is that both radiation and matter are treated quantum mechanically.
	For almost all atomic and molecular systems, which contain bound
	electrons moving at velocities considerably less than that of light,
	a non-relativistic formulation of QED is appropriate. Termed molecular
	QED, its Hamiltonian operator can be constructed by starting from
	the classical Lagrangian function for the interaction of a charged
	particle with a radiation field on applying the variational calculus
	and carrying out the canonical quantization procedure. It is shown
	how the minimal-coupling Lagrangian can be transformed to the chemically
	advantageous multipolar Hamiltonian in which matter couples to radiation
	directly through molecular multipole moments, with the ensuing interaction
	strictly causal. Applications include evaluation of transition rates
	for one- and two-photon absorption, spontaneous and stimulated emission,
	and signal intensities for second- and third-harmonic generation.
	Fundamental intermolecular interactions examined include resonance
	energy transfer, the van der Waals dispersion potential, and the
	change in energy shift of the pair induced by intense external radiation.
	The non-relativistic contribution to the Lamb shift is also extracted.
	It is shown how a number of the above mentioned processes may be
	attributed to fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field, which
	possesses zero-point energy, a signature QED effect that has widespread
	implications for the structural and dynamical properties of atoms

	Abstract = {A grid-based method designed to refine adiabatic potential energy
	surfaces (PES) of molecules via minimizing a suitable objective function
	is described. The objective function contains deviations from the
	reference (experimental) (ro)-vibrational energy levels and is based
	on PES correction values determined at the grid points within a discrete-variable-representation
	nuclear-motion algorithm and first-order perturbation theory (PT).
	The proposed PES refinement technique is tested on the ground electronic
	state of the MgH molecule. The large number of numerical test results
	obtained suggest the following: (1) first-order PT is able to yield
	accurate correction values at the grid points representing the PES,
	and for practical cases there seems to be no need to go to higher
	orders of PT; (2) with the number of grid points greatly exceeding
	the number of experimental energy levels included in the refinement
	procedure, terms additional to the ``obs-calc{''} term, including
	numerical first and second derivatives of the correction surface,
	are necessary in the objective function to arrive at a physically
	meaningful, ``smooth{''} correction surface; (3) for a given J rotational
	quantum number, the corrected PES is able to reproduce experimental
	(ro)vibrational energies to within tenths of cm(-1) if they are included
	in the refinement or interpolated between states that are involved
	in the optimization, whereas extrapolated states tend to have somewhat
	larger remaining discrepancies; (4) the PES refined only for the
	j = 0 states introduces a minor systematic error for J> 0 states,
	with discrepancies growing with j; (5) when the number of experimental
	energies included in the refinement greatly exceeds the number of
	grid points upon which the PES is optimized, the systematic error
	of treating states with different J rotational quantum numbers can
	be reduced and an impressive average accuracy can be achieved for
	all rovibrational states; and (6) in the case of quasibound (also
	known as resonance) rovibrational states, energies can be computed
	to accuracies similar to those of the bound states and excellent
	lifetimes (widths) can also be determined. Changes in thermochemical
	functions upon inclusion of quasibound states during direct summation

	For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of

	It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ
