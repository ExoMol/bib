volume = {16}, 
year = {2008},
abstract = {An incoherent broad-band cavity-enhanced absorption (IBB-CEA) set-up was used in combination with a Fourier-transform (FT) spectrometer in order to explore the potential of this technique for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy in the near-infrared region. Absorption spectra of overtone bands of CO2, OCS, and HD18O were measured between 5800 and 7000 cm--1 using a small sampling volume (1100 cm3, based on a 90 cm cavity length). The quality of the spectra in this study is comparable to that obtained with Fourier transform spectrometers employing standard multi-pass reflection cells, which require substantially larger sampling volumes. High-resolution methods such as FT-IBB-CEAS also provide an elegant way to determine effective mirror reflectivities (Reff, i.e. a measure of the inherent overall cavity loss) by using a calibration gas with well-known line strengths. For narrow absorption features and non-congested spectra this approach does not even require a zero-absorption measurement with the empty cavity. Absolute cross-sections or line strengths of a target species can also be determined in one single measurement, if gas mixtures with known partial pressures are used. This feature of FT-IBB-CEAS reduces systematic errors significantly; it is illustrated based on CO2 as calibration gas.},

Abstract = {{Measurements of line positions and strengths of (D2O)-O-18 and

   were analyzed to obtain energy levels of the (100), (020), and (001)
   vibrational states of (HDO)-O-18 and the (001) and (011) states of
   (D2O)-O-18 and the vibrational bands of these states connected to the
   ground state covered the spectral region from 2500 to 4278 cm(-1). 456
   absorption lines of (D2O)-O-18 and 856 lines of (HDO)-O-18 were assigned
   from the spectra. The measurements were of oxygen-18 enriched samples of
   deuterated water vapour and the spectra also contained features of
   (HDO)-O-16, (D2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18 of which
   several were used as frequency calibration standards. }},
