abstract = {Due to the very large number of experimental, empirical, and computational studies addressing the rovibrational transitions and the underlying energy levels of the main isotopologue, H216O, of the water molecule, the room-temperature coverage offered by the canonical line-by-line spectroscopic database HITRAN2020 is almost complete, 99.87%, up to 6600 cm−1. This study provides a detailed comparison of two recent datasets, one with measured line positions and intensities obtained using a dual-comb spectrometer (DCS) from 6600 to 7500 cm−1 at temperatures up to 1300 K (neglecting the experimentally covered region of 7500–7650 cm−1 with noisy spectral features), and the other a composite empirical line list, called CW2024, covering the spectrum from the microwave to the ultraviolet. The aim has been the mutual validation of the two datasets, correction of possible errors in both of them, and providing additional validated experimental data for inclusion in line-by-line databases. At the end, 5419 transitions from the DCS measurement database were investigated with respect to those in the CW2024 line list, with the majority of the lines falling within the respective individual uncertainties of the two datasets. Using the composite empirical CW2024 database as a reference, 423 assignments were made for a subset of the 616 lines measured at high temperatures which are not part of HITRAN2020. Thus, in the region 6600–7500 cm−1 all but seven transitions, with intensities above a room-temperature cutoff of 1×10−28 cmmolecule−1, have become experimentally known. In the Supplementary Material to this paper, an updated DCS database is provided, showcasing the improvements described in the article.}

Title = {The Far-Infrared Absorption Spectrum of HD<SUP>16</SUP>O: Experimental
   Line Positions, Accurate Empirical Energy Levels, and a Recommended Line
   List},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},
Abstract = {The far-infrared absorption spectrum of monodeuterated water vapor,
   HD16O, is analyzed using three high-sensitivity absorption spectra
   recorded by high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy at the SOLEIL
   synchrotron facility. The gas sample was obtained using a 1:1 mixture of
   H2O and D2O leading to a HDO abundance close to 50\%. The room
   temperature spectra recorded in the 50-720 cm-1 range cover most of the
   rotational band. The sensitivity of the recordings allows for lowering
   by three orders of magnitude the detectivity threshold of previous
   absorption studies in the region. Line centers are determined with a
   typical accuracy of 5 x 10-5 cm-1 for well-isolated lines. The combined
   line list of 8522 water lines is assigned to 9186 transitions of the
   nine stable water isotopologues (H2XO, HDXO, and D2XO with X = 16, 17,
   and 18). Regarding the HD16O isotopologue, a total of 2443 transitions
   are presently assigned while about 530 absorption transitions were
   available prior to our SOLEIL recordings. The comparison with the HITRAN
   list of HD16O transitions is discussed in detail. The obtained set of
   accurate HD16O transition frequencies is merged with literature sources
   to generate a set of 1121 accurate empirical rotation-vibration energies
   for the first five vibrational states (000), (010), (100), (020), and
   (001). The comparison to the previous dataset from an IUPAC task group
   illustrates a gain in the average energy accuracy by more than one order
   of magnitude. Based on these levels, a recommended list of transitions
   between the first five vibrational states is proposed for HD16O in the
   0-4650 cm-1 frequency range.},

Abstract = {{We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to survey the
   Galactic Centre for the 22-GHz transition of water. The survey provides
   an unbiased search for water masers within a 0.5 deg2 region about the
   Centre, and the small synthesized beam directly yields positions to
   arcsecond accuracy. The detected sources were re-observed 4 months later
   and showed considerable changes in their spectra, with two sources found
   in the follow-up that were not seen in the original survey, yielding a
   total of 27 maser detections.
   Comparison with methanol and OH surveys shows that, at current
   sensitivity levels, water masers greatly outnumber the other species. 12
   of our maser detections had previously been reported, discovered during
   searches towards interesting targets in the survey area. The majority of
   our sources are quite weak, consistent with excitation by young massive
   stars mostly near the Galactic Centre. Our spectra reveal high-velocity
   outflows at one-quarter of the water maser sites, a statistic similar to
   sites in the remainder of the Galaxy.}}}

Title = {{Assessment of the consistency of H$_2$O line intensities over the
   near-infrared using sun-pointing ground-based Fourier transform
   spectroscopy}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {2268-2280},
Abstract = {{We report on the consistency of water vapour line intensities in
   selected spectral regions between 800-12,000 cm(-1) under atmospheric
   conditions using sun-pointing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
   Measurements were made across a number of days at both a low and high
   altitude field site, sampling a relatively moist and relatively dry
   atmosphere. Our data suggests that across most of the 800-12,000 cm(-1)
   spectral region water vapour line intensities in recent spectral line
   databases are generally consistent with what was observed. However, we
   find that HITRAN-2008 water vapour line intensities are systematically
   lower by up to 20\% in the 8000-9200 cm(-1) spectral interval relative
   to other spectral regions. This discrepancy is essentially removed when
   two new linelists (UCL08, a compilation of linelists and ab-initio
   calculations, and one based on recent laboratory measurements by Oudot
   et al. (2010) {[}10] in the 8000-9200 cm(-1) spectral region) are used.
   This strongly suggests that the H2O line strengths in the HITRAN-2008
   database are indeed underestimated in this spectral region and in need
   of revision. The calculated global-mean clear-sky absorption of solar
   radiation is increased by about 0.3 W m(-2) when using either the UCL08
   or Oudot line parameters in the 8000-9200 cm(-1) region, instead of
   HITRAN-2008. We also found that the effect of isotopic fractionation of
   HDO is evident in the 2500-2900 cm(-1) region in the observations.}}}

   telescope on Kitt Peak. When possible, solar observations at different
   air masses and on different days have allowed the less opaque telluric
   lines to be effectively removed from the program spectrum. The solar
   lines have been identified by searching the literature on atomic and
   molecular laboratory spectroscopy and when necessary by additional
   laboratory spectroscopy. Many new identifications have been made,

   from the point of view of their molecular electronic structure. Upon
   excitation we observe dramatic changes of dipole moments and
   polarisabilities with respect to the ground state. We stress the change
   of the polarity of H2O in all excited states accompanied by the
   enhancement of the dipole polarisability by an order of magnitude.
   Large, even if less pronounced, are changes of electric properties of
   H2S in its excited states. Dipole moments and dipole polarisabilities of
   3B1, 1B1 states of H2S and H2O behave quite analogously in comparison to
   their respective ground state. The general pattern of properties for
   both molecules in their 3A2 and 1A2 excited states is more different due
   to a pronounced participation of the sulphur d-orbitals in these states
   of the H2S molecule.}}}

Abstract = {{Laboratory molecular spectroscopy provides the basis for interpretation
   of atmospheric, planetary, and astrophysical data gathered by remote
   sensing. Laboratory studies of atomic and molecular signatures across
   the electromagnetic spectrum provide high-precision, quantitative data
   used to interpret the observed environment from remote measurements.
   Historically, the region of the spectrum above 500 GHz has been
   relatively unexplored due to atmospheric absorption and technical
   difficulties generating and detecting radiation. Laboratory spectroscopy
   at these frequencies has traditionally involved measurement of one or
   two absorption features and relied on fitting of models to the limited
   data. We report a new spectrometer built around a computer-controlled
   commercial synthesizer and millimeter-wave module driving a series of
   amplifiers followed by a series of wide-bandwidth frequency doublers and
   triplers. The spectrometer provides the ability to rapidly measure large
   pieces of frequency space with higher resolution, accuracy, and
   sensitivity than with Fourier transform infrared techniques. The
   approach is simple, modular, and requires no custom-built electronics or
   high voltage and facilitates the use of infrared.}},

 abstract = {{...  modelling specific water vapour absorption bands within the 1.18 mu m
   window. We compare the results with the normal technique of obtaining
   the abundance by matching the peak of the 1.18 mu m window. Ground-based
   infrared imaging spectroscopy of the night side of Venus was obtained
   with the Anglo-Australian Telescope and IRIS2 instrument with a spectral
   resolving power of R similar to 2400. The spectra have been fitted with
   modelled spectra simulated using the radiative transfer model VSTAR. We
   find a best fit abundance of 31 ppmv (-6 +9 ppmv), which is in agreement
   with recent results by Bezard et al. (Bezard, B., Fedorova, A., Bertaux,
   J.-L., Rodin, A., Korablev, O. {[}2011]. Icarus, 216, 173-183) using
   VEX/SPICAV (R similar to 1700) and contrary to prior results by Bezard
   et al. (Bezard, B., de Bergh, C., Crisp, D., Maillard, J.P. {[}1990].
   Nature, 345, 508-511) of 44 ppmv (+/- 9 ppmv) using VEX/VIRTIS-M (R
   similar to 200) data analyses. Comparison studies are made between water
   vapour abundances determined from the peak of the 1.18 mu m window and
   abundances determined from different water vapour absorption features
   within the near infrared window. We find that water vapour abundances
   determined over the peak of the 1. 18 mu m window results in plots with
   less scatter than those of the individual water vapour features and that
   analyses conducted over some individual water vapour features are more
   sensitive to variation in water vapour than those over the peak of the
   1. 18 mu m window. No evidence for horizontal spatial variations across
   the night side of the disk are found within the limits of our data with
   the exception of a possible small decrease in water vapour from the
   equator to the north pole. We present spectral ratios that show water
   vapour absorption from within the lowest 4 km of the Venus atmosphere
   only, and discuss the possible existence of a decreasing water vapour
   concentration towards the surface. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights
