Abstract = {{The current edition of the HITRAN compilation employed a sophisticated
   algorithm for combining measurements available for the air-broadened
   half-widths of water-vapor absorption lines with theoretical values.
   Nevertheless, some of the values in the HITRAN database were found to be
   far from ideal, due to large dispersions that still exist in the
   experimental or theoretical methods. Therefore, new criteria were
   developed for introducing the best available air-broadened half-widths
   into HITRAN, based on physical principles and statistics. This update
   concerns the three most abundant isotopologues of water, with the values
   for (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18 17 180 being the ones from analogous
   transitions of the principal isotopologues. The new parameters have been
   tested in different remote-sensing applications and improved constituent
   profiles were obtained. In total, air-broadened half-width values were
   updated for 11,787 transitions of water 16 170 vapor in the HITRAN
   database (6789 for (H2O)-O-16, 2906 for (H2O)-O-17,and 2092 for
   (H2O)-O-18). Some additional updates to the water-vapor line list are
   also presented. The resultant file (01\_hit06.par) was uploaded to the

   This result is based on a search for the C-X band of water near 1240

   (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observational Limit on the
   water abundance, together with detailed chemical models of translucent
   clouds and previous measurements of OH along the line of sight,
   constrains the branching ratio in the dissociative recombination of H3O+
   to form water. We find at the 3 sigma level that no more than 30\% of
   dissociative recombinations of H3O+ can lead to H2O. The observed
   spectrum also yielded high-resolution observations of the Mg II doublet
   at 1239.9 Angstrom and 1240.4 Angstrom, allowing the velocity structure
   of the dominant ionization state of magnesium to be studied along the

   at lower spectral resolution that were obtained previously but allow an

   Dynamics}},
Journal = {Acc. Chem. Res.},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {369-378},
Abstract = {{Water and light are two common constituents of both the earth's
   atmosphere and interstellar space. Consequently, water photodissoclation
   is a central component of the chemistry of these environments.
   Electronically excited molecules can dissociate adiabatically (on a
   single potential energy surface, or PES) or nonadiabatically (with
   transfer between PESs), and water serves as a prototype for
   understanding these two processes in unimolecular dissodation. In recent
   years, extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been focused
   on water photolysis, particularly on the primary product of the
   dissociation, the OH radical. The use of the high-resolution H-atom
   Rydberg tagging technique, in combination with various vacuum
   ultra-violet (VUV) sources, has spurred significant advances in water
   photochemistry. As the excitation energy increases, different excited
   electronic states of water can be reached, and the mutual interactions
   between these states increase significantly. In this Account, we present
   the most recent developments in water photodissociation that have been
   derived from the study of the four lowest electronic excited states.
   The (A) over tilde (1)B(1) state photodissociation of H(2)O has been
   studied at 157.6 nm and was found to be a fast and direct dissociation 4
   process on a single repulsive surface, with only vibrational excitation
   of the OH(X(2)Pi) product. In contrast, the dissociation of the (B) over
   tilde (1)A(1) state was found to proceed via two main routes: one
   adiabatic pathway leading to OH(A(2)Sigma(+)) + H, and one nonadiabatic
   pathway to OH(X(2)Pi) + H through conical intersections between the (B)
   over tilde state and the ground state (X) over tilde (1)A(1). An
   interesting quantum A interference between two conical intersection
   pathways has also been observed. In addition, photodissodation of H(2)O
   between 128 and 133 nm has been studied with tunable VUV radiation.
   Experimental results illustrate that excitation to the different
   unstable resonances of the state has very different effects on the
   OH(X(2)Pi) and OH(A(2)Sigma(+)) product channels.
   The (C) over tilde (1)B(1) state of H(2)O is a predissodative Rydberg
   state with fully resolved rotational structures. A striking variation in
   the OH product state distribution and its stereodynamics has been
   observed for different rotational states. There are two kinds of
   nonadiabatic dissociation routes on the (C) over tilde state. The first
   involves Renner-Teller (electronic Coriolis) coupling to the (B) over
   tilde state, leading to rotationally hot and vibrationally cold OH
   products. The second goes through a newly discovered homogeneous
   nonadiabatic coupling to the (A) over tilde state, leading to
   rotationally cold and vibrationally hot OH products. But the (D) over
   tilde (1)A(1), state shows no rotational structure and leads to a fast,
   homogeneous, purely electronic predissociation to the (B) over tilde
   state.
   These studies demonstrate the truly fascinating nature of water
   photochemistry, which is extremely variable because of the different
   electronic states and their interactions. The results also provide a
   rather complete picture of water photochemistry and should be helpful in
   the modeling of interstellar chemistry, with its abundant VUV radiation.}}}

Abstract = {{A single-mode cavity ring-down spectrometer, which incorporates a
   stabilized and tuneable comb of resonant frequencies and a
   continuous-wave external-cavity diode probe laser, was used to study
   rovibrational absorption line shapes within the 2 nu(1)+nu(3) and 3

   noise-equivalent absorption coefficient of 2x10(-9) cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) and
   frequency resolution of 50 kHz, enables high-precision measurements of
   line-shape effects and pressure shifting of relatively weak absorption
   transitions. We investigated the room-temperature pressure dependence
   over the range from 0.5 Pa to 50 kPa of two H(2) (16)O transitions
   perturbed by He, N(2), and SF(6). Foreign-gas broadening and
   pressure-shift coefficients were determined for a relatively strong
   transition at 10 687.36 cm(-1), and for a weaker transition at 10 834.34
   cm(-1) the self- and N(2)-broadening and pressure-shift parameters were
   measured. In the low-pressure limit the room-temperature Doppler width
   was measured within 0.2\% of its expected value. Doppler-free saturation
   effects were also observed with linewidths below 2 MHz. The data were
   compared to semiclassical line-shape models that considered the
   influence of Dicke narrowing as well as the speed dependence of pressure
   broadening and pressure shifting. Taking both of these effects into
   account gave the best agreement with our observations and allowed us to
   model the observed asymmetries of experimental profiles. Hard- and
   soft-collision as well as billiard-ball collision models were
   considered. These results allowed us to quantify systematic errors in
   line intensity and in pressure broadening associated with oversimplified
   models of line shape.}},

Abstract = {{In 1995, the International Association for the Properties of Water and
   Steam (IAPWS) adopted a new formulation called ``The IAPWS Formulation
   1995 he Thermodynamic Properties of Ordinary Water Substance for General
   and Scientific Use{''}, which we abbreviate to IAPWS-95 formulation or
   IAPWS-95 for short. This IAPWS-95 formulation replaces the previous
   formulation adopted in 1984. This work provides information on the,
   selected experimental, data of the thermodynamic properties of,water
   used to develop the new formulation, but information is also given on
   newer data. The article presents all details of the IAPWS-95
   formulation, which is in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in
   the Helmholtz free energy. The function for the residual part of the
   Helmholtz-free energy was fitted to selected data for the following
   properties: (a) thermal properties of the single-phase region (prhoT)
   and of the vapor-liquid phase boundary (p(sigma)rho'rho{''}T), including
   the phase-equilibrium condition (Maxwell criterion), and (b) the caloric
   properties specific isochoric heat capacity, specific isobaric heat
   capacity, speed of sound, differences in, the specific enthalpy and in
   the specific internal energy, Joule,Thomson coefficient, and isothermal
   throttling coefficient. By applying modem strategies for optimizing the
   functional form of the equation of state and for the simultaneous
   nonlinear fitting to the. data of all mentioned properties, the
   resulting IAPWS-95 formulation covers a validity range for temperatures
   from the melting line (lowest temperature 251.2 K at 209.9 MPa) to 1273
   K and pressures up to 1000 MPa. In this entire range. of validity,
   IAPWS-95 represents even the most accurate data to within their
   experimental uncertainty. In the most important part of the liquid
   region, the estimated uncertainty,of IAPWS-95 ranges from +/- 0.001\% to
   +/- 0.02\% in density, +/- 0.03\% to +/- 0.2\% in speed of sound, and
   +/- 0.1\% in isobaric heat capacity. In the liquid region at ambient
   pressure, IAPWS-95 is extremely accurate in density (uncertainty less
   than or equal to+/-0.0001\%) and in speed of sound ( 0.005\%). In a
   large part of the gas region the estimated uncertainty in density ranges
   from +/- 0.03\% to +/- 0.05\%, in speed of sound it amounts to +/-
   0.15\% and in isobaric heat capacity it is +/- 0.2\%. In the critical
   region, IAPWS 95 represents not only the thermal properties very well
   but also the caloric properties in a reasonable way. Special interest
   has been focused on the extrapolation behavior of the new formulation.
   At least for the basic properties such as pressure and enthalpy,
   IAPWS-95 can be extrapolated up to extremely high pressures and
   temperatures. In addition to, the IAPWS-95 formulation, independent
   equations for. he densities, and the most important caloric vapor,
   pressure, properties along the vapor-liquid phase boundary, and for the
   pressure on the melting and sublimation curve, are given. Moreover, a
   so-called gas equation for densities lip to 55 kg m(-3) is also
   included. Tables of the thermodynamic properties calculated from the
   IAPWS-95 formulation are listed in the Appendix. }}}

  abstract={Using NASA's Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite ( SWAS ), we have examined the production of water in quiescent and shocked molecular gas through a survey of the 556.936 GHz 1 10 -1 01 transition of ortho-H 2 O in the NGC 1333 molecular core. These observations reveal broad emission lines associated with the IRAS 2, IRAS 4, IRAS 7, and HH 7-11 outflows. Toward three positions we detect narrow (Δ v ~ 2-3 km s -1 ) emission lines clearly associated with the ambient gas. The SWAS observations, with a resolution of ~4', are supplemented with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory ( ISO ) and by an unbiased survey of a ~17' × 15' area, with ~50'' resolution, in the low- J transitions of CO, 13 CO, C 18 O, N 2 H + , CH 3 OH, and SiO. Using these combined data sets, with consistent assumptions, we find beam-averaged ortho-H 2 O abundances of greater than 10 -6 relative to H 2 for all four outflows. A comparison of SWAS and ISO water data is consistent with nondissociative shock models, provided the majority of the ortho-H 2 O (1 10 -1 01 ) emission arises from cool postshock material with enhanced abundances. In the ambient gas the ortho-H 2 O abundance is found to lie between 0.1 × 10 -7 and 1 × 10 -7 relative to H 2 and is enhanced when compared to cold prestellar molecular cores. A comparison of the water emission with tracers of dense condensations and shock chemistry finds no clear correlation. However, the water emission appears to be associated with the presence of luminous external heating sources that power the reflection nebula and the photodissociation region (PDR). Simple PDR models are capable of reproducing the water and high- J 13 CO emission, suggesting that a PDR may account for the excitation of water in low-density undepleted gas, as suggested by Spaans & van Dishoeck.}

Pages = {89-700},
Abstract = {{First detections of thermal water vapor absorption lines have been made
   toward Orion IRc2 using the Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) on board
   the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Grating spectra covering
   wavelengths 25-45 mu m yield 19 pure rotational lines, originating from
   energy levels 200-750 K above ground. Fabry-Perot spectra of 5
   transitions resolve the line profiles and reveal the H2O gas kinematics.
   The fact that all lines are seen in absorption is in striking contrast
   with data from the ISO Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS), where the H2O
   lines appear in emission. At least one line displays a P-Cygni type
   profile, which suggests that the water is located in an expanding shell
   centered on or near IRc2. The expansion velocity is 18 kms(-1), in
   agreement with the value inferred from H2O maser observations by Genzel
   et al. (1981). Because the continuum is intense and likely formed in or
   near the water-containing gas, the excitation of the observed
   transitions is dominated by radiative processes. A simple, generalised
   curve-of-growth method is presented and used to analyze the data. A mean
   excitation temperature of 72 K and a total H2O column density of 1.5 x
   10(18) cm(-2) are inferred, each with an estimated maximum uncertainty
   of 20\%. Combined with the Ha column density derived from ISO
   observations of the pure rotational Ha lines, and an assumed temperature
   of 200-350 K, the inferred H2O abundance is 2-5 x 10(-4) in the warm
   shocked gas. This abundance is similar to that found recently by Harwit
   et al. (1998) toward Orion using data from the LWS, but higher than that
   found for most other shocked regions by, for example, Liseau et al.
   (1996).}}}

  title={First Detection of Water Vapor in a Pre-stellar Core},
  journal=ApJ,
  volume={759},
  pages={L37},
  year={2012},
  abstract={Water is a crucial molecule in molecular astrophysics as it controls much of the gas/grain chemistry, including the formation and evolution of more complex organic molecules in ices. Pre-stellar cores provide the original reservoir of material from which future planetary systems are built, but few observational constraints exist on the formation of water and its partitioning between gas and ice in the densest cores. Thanks to the high sensitivity of the Herschel Space Observatory , we report on the first detection of water vapor at high spectral resolution toward a dense cloud on the verge of star formation, the pre-stellar core L1544. The line shows an inverse P-Cygni profile, characteristic of gravitational contraction. To reproduce the observations, water vapor has to be present in the cold and dense central few thousand AU of L1544, where species heavier than helium are expected to freeze out onto dust grains, and the ortho:para H 2 ratio has to be around 1:1 or larger. The observed amount of water vapor within the core (about 1.5 × 10 –6 M ☉ ) can be maintained by far-UV photons locally produced by the impact of galactic cosmic rays with H 2 molecules. Such FUV photons irradiate the icy mantles, liberating water vapor in the core center. Our Herschel data, combined with radiative transfer and chemical/dynamical models, shed light on the interplay between gas and solids in dense interstellar clouds and provide the first measurement of the water vapor abundance profile across the parent cloud of a future solar-type star and its potential planetary system.}

Pages = {173-279},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear effects in rotational spectra of molecules and atomic
   nuclei caused by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces are investigated
   for high values of angular-momentum quantum number I. It is shown that
   qualitative changes of the rotational-motion regime may occur in a
   rotational spectrum for the critical value I(c) due to the appearance or
   disappearance of a degeneracy in a rotational band. This critical
   phenomenon corresponds to the bifurcation in classical mechanics and
   manifests itself both in the rearrangement of rotational multiplet
   levels and in the qualitative change of electromagnetic transitions in
   the band.
   The classification of bifurcations for a purely rotational motion is
   given. The classification is based on the concept of a local symmetry
   group. There exist five types of bifurcations in rotational spectra, the
   most interesting of which are those analogous to the second-order phase
   transitions (local bifurcation). The difference between the local
   bifurcations in a finite many-body system and second-order phase
   transitions in macroscopic ones is discussed. It was shown that a
   universal effective rotational Hamiltonian exists in the neighborhood of
   I(c), which makes it possible to develop a phenomenological theory of
   local bifurcations.
   The existence of bifurcations of various types in experimentally
   observed molecular and nuclear rotational spectra is established. The
   bifurcations in high-spin rotational states of odd-A nuclei, nonlinear
   symmetrical three-atomic molecules XY2, and tetrahedral molecules XY4
   are investigated theoretically and compared with experimental data.}},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Abstract = {{We present a low uncertainty measurement technique for determining
   molecular transition frequencies. This approach is complementary to
   sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopies and is expected to enable new
   frequency measurements for a wide variety of molecular species with
   uncertainties at the kHz-level. The technique involves measurements of
   Doppler broadened lines using cavity ring-down spectroscopy whereby the
   probe laser is actively locked to the ring-down cavity and the spectrum
   frequencies are linked directly to an optical frequency comb that is
   referenced to an atomic frequency standard. As a demonstration we have
   measured the transition frequency of the (30012) <- (00001) P14e line of
   CO2 near 1.57 mu m with a combined standard uncertainty of similar to 9
   kHz. This technique exhibits exceptional promise for measurements of
   transition frequencies and pressure shifting parameters of many weak
   absorbers, and indicates the potential for substantially improved
   measurements when compared to those obtained with conventional
   spectroscopic methods. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The outcomes of a specific study on line shape deviations from the usual
   Voigt profile, in the near-IR spectrum of water, will be discussed.
   Particularly, a great attention is paid to the role of speed-dependence
   of collisional broadening. From the experimental point of view, high
   spectral fidelity has been reached by using the technique of
   offset-frequency locking between two extended-cavity diode lasers. In
   such a system, the master laser is frequency stabilized against a narrow
   sub-Doppler molecular line, while the slave laser is actively controlled
   so that its emission frequency maintains a given offset with respect to
   the frequency of the master. This method allows one to perform highly
   accurate and reproducible frequency scans of the slave laser around a
   given vibration-rotation line. I will present recent findings on the
   speed dependence of collision parameters, influencing the shape of
   (H2O)-O-18 absorption lines. Finally, I will discuss the implications
   for the spectroscopic determination of the Boltzmann constant.}},
