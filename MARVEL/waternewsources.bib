Abstract = {{An extensive Doppler-free spectroscopic investigation of the
   near-infrared absorption spectrum of the (H2O)-O-18 molecule was
   performed, for the first time, with absolute frequency calibration by
   using a GPS-disciplined fiber-based optical frequency comb. The
   investigated line pairs belong to the nu(1) + nu(3) band and have been
   chosen in the wavelength range from 1.38 to 1.41 mu m with a lambda
   scheme, so as to share the excited energy level and allow an accurate
   determination of the rotational energy separations of the fundamental
   vibrational state. The measurement of the sub-Doppler line-center
   frequencies, also extended to the (H2O)-O-17 spectrum, has been
   performed with an overall uncertainty of similar to 30 kHz, i.e. about
   three orders of magnitude lower than the HITRAN data set. The retrieved
   energy separations agree, by less than 80 kHz, with recent findings
   provided by the so-called MARVEL procedure for spectral data inversion,
   thus yielding a very stringent test of its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The absorption line shape of a given (H2O)-O-18 vibration-rotation line
   at 1.38 mu m was deeply investigated using a spectroscopic approach
   based upon the use of a pair of offset-frequency locked extended-cavity
   diode lasers. This dual-laser apparatus ensures extreme levels of
   accuracy in controlling and measuring any variation of the laser
   frequency around a given absolute reference. As a result, high levels of
   precision and accuracy were reached in the observation of a molecular
   absorption line shape in the near infrared. A variety of semiclassical
   models, accounting for Dicke narrowing and speed-dependent effects, were
   implemented and tested in order to describe the physical situation of
   self-colliding (H2O)-O-18 molecules. Our study demonstrates that the
   molecular confinement alone is unable to explain entirely the departures
   from the Voigt profile and that the speed dependence of pressure-induced
   broadening and shift cannot be ignored, even in the case of pure water
   samples at relatively small pressures. The absorption spectrum was
   successfully interpolated using the uncorrelated version of the
   speed-dependent Galatry profile, with a hypergeometric dependence on the
   absorber speed for both pressure broadening and pressure shift
   parameters, thus reaching an agreement between theory and experiment at

abstract ={{The absorption spectrum of water vapor in “natural” isotopic abundance has been recorded by high sensitivity Continuous Wave Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CW-CRDS) between 5852 and 6607 cm−1. The investigated region covers the 1.5 µm transparency window of major importance for atmospheric applications. The achieved sensitivity of the recordings varies from αmin ∼2×10−11 to 2×10−10 cm−1 and allows for a significant amount of new or more accurate observations compared to previous studies. Measured line intensities cover a range of six orders of magnitude (2×10−30−2×10−24 cm/molecule at room temperature). The vibration–rotation assignments were performed using known experimental energy levels and calculated spectra based on variational calculations by Schwenke and Partridge.
Five thousand seven hundred and twenty seven lines were assigned to 6379 transitions of six water isotopologues (H216O, H218O, H217O, HD16O, HD18O and HD17O). The first detection of lines due to HD17O in “natural” water (relative abundance on the order of 1.1×10−7) illustrates the sensitivity of the recordings. Most of the 1842 newly reported transitions belong to the main isotopologue (1022 transitions) and to the HD16O isotopologue (684 transitions). Sixty-three levels are newly determined and 22 are corrected by more than 0.015 cm−1 compared to those recommended by the water IUPAC task group.
Overall, a list of 6589 transitions was constructed for the studied region. The present CRDS line list complemented with 210 strong transitions from the literature is believed to be the most complete empirical list of the region. The obtained results are critically compared to recent IUPAC task group compilations. Overall the agreement between variational and measured intensities is very satisfactory. We nevertheless point out a number of important disagreements for some lines of the highly excited bending bands, mainly 4ν2 of H216O.}},

For the inside and environmental safety of the disposal sites, the tiny outgassing rates leaking out the containers are measured. Presently, the radioactive \{HT\} gas is measured by liquid scintillation. However an alternative method—cavity ring down spectroscopy, an isotopically selective laser technique based on molecular spectroscopy—is currently developed and evaluated for tritium measurement in its oxidized form, HTO. Applying this method, the number density of the gaseous \{HTO\} sample hold in the optical cavity cell, is derived from the laser beam absorption by vibrational symmetric stretching 2ν1 (R) \{HTO\} lines in the 4590 and 4600 cm−1 spectral range. To ensure a future accurate \{HTO\} measurement, the theoretical line intensities are confronted to the experiment: two tritiated water standards are measured with a dedicated \{CRDS\} set-up. Compared to the theoretical database, the line positions are correct (−0.067 to −0.128 cm−1), their relative intensities are in agreement with the database, but their absolute intensities are 20% weaker. Among the seven intense lines, the 4596.485 cm−1 line (intensity 8.22 10−22 cm/molecule) and the 4592.407 cm−1 line (intensity 9.83 10−22 cm/molecule) are isolated and intense for a sensitive detection. The \{HTO\} detection limit with the present set-up is 3 kBq (10 min), equivalent to 1.8 1012 molecules in the 111 cm3 \{CRDS\} cell. This detection limit could be improved by a factor 3 by reducing the detection noise. "

   identified as being due to ammonia present as an impurity at the 5 ppm
   concentration level in the water sample. Although incomplete, the
   obtained ammonia line list seems to be the first one in the region. More
   than 3193 water lines were assigned to 3560 transitions of five water
   isotopologues ((H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-18, (H2O)-O-17, (HDO)-O-16 and
   (HDO)-O-18). The assignments were performed using known experimental
   energy levels and calculated spectra based on variational calculations
   by Schwenke and Partridge. The obtained results are compared to the most
   relevant previous studies by Fourier Transform Spectroscopy in the
   region and to the exhaustive review of rovibrational line positions and
   levels performed recently by an IUPAC sponsored task group. Two-hundred
   and sixty-six levels are newly determined and 46 are corrected by more
   than 0.015 cm(-1) compared to those recommended by the water IUPAC task
   group. The overall agreement between variational and measured
   intensities is satisfactory.
   A complete empirical list of 4473 transitions incorporating all the
   experimental information at disposal was constructed for water in the
   studied region. The intensity cut-off was fixed to 1 x 10(-29)
   cm/molecule at 296 K. A detailed comparison with the line list as
   provided by the HITRAN database illustrates the advantages of the new

   Spectroscopy (CW-CRDS) of natural water, complemented with literature
   data for the strongest lines. The list includes 38,318 transitions of
   four major water isotopologues ((H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-18, (H2O)-O-17 and
   (HDO)-O-16) with an intensity cut-off of 1 x 10(-29) cm/molecule at 296
   K. The list is made mostly complete over the whole spectral region by
   including a large number of weak lines with positions calculated using
   experimentally determined energy levels and intensities obtained from
   variational calculations. In addition, we provide (HDO)-O-18 and

   The global list (40,290 transitions) for water including the

We acquired absorption spectra on room-temperature, water samples over the pressure range 150–800 Pa with the frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy technique. In order to optimize measurement accuracy, we integrated mK-level temperature control and SI-traceable pressure measurements into our cavity ring-down spectroscopy measurements. This technique yielded relative uncertainties of 0.04% and 0.20% in sample density and measured line intensity, respectively. We also referenced our spectrum frequency axes to a Cs clock, which provided vacuum line positions with a combined standard uncertainty of 3 MHz. Comparison of our measured intensities, positions and self-broadening parameters with literature values reveals that the present work substantially reduces uncertainty in these line parameters. For the (1,0,1)–(0,0,0) vibrational band, the measured line intensities agree at the 1%-level with published ab initio calculations. Our spectra exhibited signal-to-noise ratios up to ≈20,000:1 to enable stringent tests of theoretical line profiles through multispectrum least-squares data analysis. We show that the partially correlated, quadratic-speed-dependent Nelkin–Ghatak profile gives a quality of fit that is commensurate with the high spectrum signal-to-noise ratio, and unlike most other profiles considered here, reproduces the measured line shapes without systematic residuals over the entire pressure range. Our results confirm that mechanisms of (1) collisional narrowing, (2) speed-dependent effects and (3) partial correlation between velocity-changing and dephasing collisions, contribute to the self-broadened line shape of isolated water vapor transitions.

abstract="The infrared spectrum of water observed in sunspots is complex and dense, with bands separated by approximately 0.01 cm−1. For top asymmetrical molecules, there is no theoretical approach that allows for the calculation of rotovibrational energy with such precision. Experimentally derived rotovibracional energy levels of water at high temperatures combined with variational calculations have been used for the band assignments. These energy levels are employed to refine the analysis of a small portion of the infrared absorption spectrum. Such procedure has allowed for the identification of additional 55 bands to the 70 already identified as rotovibrational transitions of the water molecule. Our new assignments, which include pure and cross transitions, offer additional evidence of the existence of water on the sun, but above all they illustrate the complexity of the solar spectrum that involves states with higher levels of rotational excitation. Given the conditions on the sun, more molecules of water would occur in excited electronic states, which include apolar and paramagnetic states, generating intense bands in the spectrum. Since there is an analytical solution for the rotovibrational transitions of linear molecules, we were able to identify 16 bands relative to the excited electronic states 1B2 and 3A1 in the sunspot spectrum. Density functional B3LYP/AUG-cc-pVTZ calculations of the electric and magnetic dipole are employed to discuss some consequences of the presence of excited states of water in the dynamics of sunspots and solar magnetic field.",

Uncertainties in the temperature dependences of the CO2-broadened half-width coefficients lead to large errors in the retrieved mixing ratios and hence in \{HDO\} column abundances. In this high-resolution \{FTIR\} laboratory study, we report first measurements of the temperature dependences of half-width coefficients for \{HDO\} transitions in the ν1 and 2ν2 bands broadened by CO2. Accurate line positions, intensities, CO2-broadened width and pressure shift coefficients, their temperature dependences, collisional line mixing coefficients for HDO-CO2 system and quadratic speed dependence parameters have been retrieved for a large number of transitions in the ν1 band. Room-temperature self-broadened half-width coefficients, self-shift coefficients, and collisional line-mixing coefficients for HDO-HDO system were also measured for the same number of ν1 transitions. Positions and intensities were measured for nearly 60 transitions in the weaker 2ν2 band along with a few room-temperature measurements of CO2- and self-broadening and pressure-shift coefficients. These results were obtained from simultaneous nonlinear least squares fittings of ten high-resolution absorption spectra recorded with the Bruker IFS-125HR \{FTS\} at \{JPL\} and two coolable sample cells. Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy (MCRB) formalism was applied to compute both types of broadening and pressure shift coefficients, and the temperature dependences of the CO2- and self-broadening parameters.

abstract = "Abstract CO2-rich planetary atmospheres such as those of Mars and Venus require accurate knowledge of \{CO2\} broadened \{HDO\} half-width coefficients and their temperature dependence exponents for reliable abundance determination. Although a few calculated line lists have recently been published on HDO–CO2 line shapes and their temperature dependences, laboratory measurements of those parameters are thus far non-existent. In this work, we report the first measurements of CO2-broadened half-width and pressure-shift coefficients and their temperature dependences for over 220 transitions in the ν2 band. First measurements of self-broadened half-width and self-shift coefficients at room temperature are also obtained for majority of these transitions. In addition, the first experimental determination of collisional line mixing has been reported for 11 transition pairs for HDO–CO2 and HDO–HDO systems. These results were obtained by analyzing ten high-resolution spectra of \{HDO\} and HDO–CO2 mixtures at various sample temperatures and pressures recorded with the Bruker IFS-125HR Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Two coolable absorption cells with path lengths of 20.38 cm and 20.941 m were used to record the spectra. The various line parameters were retrieved by fitting all ten spectra simultaneously using a multispectrum nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The \{HDO\} transitions in the 1100–4100 cm−1 range were extracted from the \{HITRAN2012\} database. For the ν2 and 2ν2 -ν2 bands there were 2245 and 435 transitions, respectively. Modified Complex Robert–Bonamy formalism (MCRB) calculations were made for the half-width coefficients, their temperature dependence and the pressure shift coefficients for the HDO–CO2 and HDO–HDO collision systems. \{MCRB\} calculations are compared with the measured values.

Abstract = {{The room temperature absorption spectrum of water vapor highly enriched
   in O-17 has been recorded by Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS)
   between 7443 and 7921 cm(-1). Three series of recordings were performed
   with pressure values around 0.1, 1 and 10 Torr. The frequency
   calibration of the present spectra benefited of the combination of the
   CRDS spectrometer to a self-referenced frequency comb. The resulting CRD
   spectrometer combines excellent frequency accuracy over a broad spectral
   region with a high sensitivity (Noise Equivalent Absorption,
   alpha(min)similar to 10(-11)-10-(10) cm(-1)).
   The investigated spectral region corresponds to the high energy range of
   the first hexade. The assignments were performed using known
   experimental energy levels as well as calculated line lists based on the
   results of Partridge and Schwenke. Overall about 4150 lines were
   measured and assigned to 4670 transitions of six water isotopologues
   ((H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-17, (H2O)-O-18, (HDO)-O-16, (HDO)-O-17 and
   (HDO)-O-18). Their intensities span six orders of magnitude from 10(-28)
   to 10(-22) cm/molecule. Most of the new results concern the (H2O)-O-17
   and (H2O)-O-17 isotopologues for which about 1600 and 400 transitions
   were assigned leading to the determination of 329 and 207 new energy
   levels, respectively. For comparison only about 300 and four transitions
   of (H2O)-O-17 and (HDO)-O-17 were previously known in the region,
   respectively.
   By comparison to highly accurate (H2O)-O-16 line positions available in
   the literature, the average accuracy on our line centers is checked to
   be on the order of 3 MHz (10(-4) cm(-1)) or better for not weak well
   isolated lines. This small uncertainty represents a significant
   improvement of the line center determination of many (H2O)-O-16 lines
   included in the experimental list provided as Supplementary Material}}}
