  abstract = {In order to approach experimental accuracy in ro-vibrational calculations
	for polyatomic molecules one needs to empirically refine even a high
	accuracy ab initio potential energy surface (PES). This is most efficiently
	done through a least-squares fitting of theoretical energies to the
	available experimental data by varying potential parameters in a
	given analytical representation. The PES resulting from such a fitting
	is then referred to as a `spectroscopic' PES. In the present work
	we report a new approach to the construction of `spectroscopic' PESs
	of polyatomic molecules. We represent the refinement as a perturbation
	to the initial PES, which is diagonalized in a basis of eigenfunctions
	of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. We apply this method to construct
	a new `spectroscopic' PES for ({NH$_3$})-N-14 using literature values
	for observed spectroscopic data for J <= 8 and covering the energy
	range below 10300 {cm$^{-1}$}. We impose the constraint that the resulting
	PES remain close to the ab initio surface. The new `spectroscopic'
	PES of {NH$_3$} (called NH3-Y2010) reproduces the selected experimental
	term values with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.2 {cm$^{-1}$}. (C)

	using a comprehensive and consistent set of quantum numbers, empirical
	lower energy levels and the BYTe variationally calculated line list
	as reference points. Labelings are checked to ensure that they obey
	both the usual selection rules and the HITRAN labeling formalisms;
	the problems identified are corrected where possible. Further assignments
	are brought into question by combination difference (CD) checking
	of implied upper energy levels. The CD analysis yields an 89\% complete
	(NH3)-N-14 energy level list up to 6610 {cm$^{-1}$} and J=21, self-consistent
	to 0.1 {cm$^{-1}$}. In combination with the 1723 previously unassigned
	and unlabeled lines in HITRAN a total of 2529 problem lines were
	identified for re-analysis. The compiled energy level list was used
	to label and assign the set of problem transitions, resulting in
	a total of 249 new assignments and a further 368 new labelings. Assignment
	by comparison with the reference line list resulted in 111 further
	new line assignments and 14 new labelings. Intensities are checked
	against recent measurements and BYTe. New intensities are proposed
	for the nu(2) band with new intensities and line positions for the
	2 nu(2)-nu(2) and new line lists are created for the nu(2)-nu(2),
	nu(2)-nu(4) and nu(4)-nu(4) bands. BYTe band intensities are analyzed
	to identify other regions of missing intensity. (C) 2013 The Authors.
