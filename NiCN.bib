Abstract = {{The electronic ground state and some low-lying excited states of NiCN
   have been studied by ab initio multi-reference single and double
   excitation configuration interaction calculations (MR-SDCI) with
   Davidson's correction Q and Cowan-Griffin's relativistic corrections
   Eel. The electronic ground state of NiCN is (2)Delta(i) and the
   equilibrium geometry is linear with bond lengths of r(e)(Ni-C) = 1.8141
   angstrom and r(e)(C-N) = 1.1665 angstrom. According to multi-reference
   averaged quadratic coupled-cluster theory (MR-AQCC) with E-rel, the
   first excited state is (2)Sigma(+), separated from the ground state by
   446 cm(-1), the second and third excited states are (2)Pi(i) (at 1594
   cm(-1)) and (4)Delta(i) (at 8930 cm(-1)), respectively, and other
   quartet states follow. The relative stabilities and the molecular
   properties of the low- and high-spin states having the same electronic
   total angular momentum are shown to be determined by dynamical electron
   correlation effects. A spin-orbit interaction scheme for the lowest
   doublet manifold is proposed. The predicted term values (in cm(-1)) are
   0 ((X) over tilde (2) Delta(5/2)), 793 ((2)Sigma(+)(1/2))1891
   ((2)Delta(3/2)), 2321 ((2)Pi(3/2)), and 2773 ((2)Pi(1/2)). Thus, an
   unassigned state reported by Kingston et al. {[}C.T. Kingston, A.J.
   Merer, T.D. Varberg, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 215 (2002) 106] at 755 cm(-1)
   could be the 1 (2)Sigma(+)(1/2) state.}},
