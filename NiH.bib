  abstract = {A global deperturbation is presented for all electronic states of
	NiH with T0 values below 0.3 eV. These states form an isolated group
	and are treated as components of a molecular ``supermultiplet{''}
	which is derived from a nickel-centered 3d9 electron configuration
	such as that found in the 2D term of Ni+. Observed term energies
	for all low-lying states, including some vibrationally excited levels,
	are used in a least squares fit to the supermultiplet model. A crucial
	feature of the supermultiplet model is its employment, wherever possible,
	of atomic angular (e.g., L +/- \textbackslash{}L-LAMBDA> = {[}L (L
	+ 1 ) - LAMBDA (LAMBDA +/- 1)]1/2\textbackslash{}L-LAMBDA +/- 1>)
	and radial (e.g., spin-orbit coupling constants) matrix elements
	to define and constrain the molecular effective Hamiltonian. A relatively
	small number of adjustable parameters are required to represent the
	upsilon = 0 and 1, J = 0.5-11.5 term values in the supermultiplet
	picture and accurately describe a variety of observations, which
	include large OMEGA-doublings, unusually large and J, OMEGA, e/f-dependent
	Zeeman g values, and a symmetry-forbidden (DELTA-LAMBDA = 2) rotational
	pertubation. The number of independently adjustable parameters required
	by the supermultiplet model is significantly smaller than a standard
	2-DELTA, 2-PI, 2-SIGMA+ deperturbation model. In addition, the fitted
	deperturbed (i.e., nonrelativistic and nonrotating) molecular constants
	for the 2-DELTA, 2-PI, 2-SIGMA+ components of the NiH supermultiplet
	are in better agreement with theoretical descriptions than previous
	empirical constants taken directly, without deperturbation, from
	spectra. The fit model also yields an empirical value of the (3d9)
	sigma approximately 3d10 configuration mixing coefficient, which
	is relevant to a global understanding of the d9 and d10 states in
	the homologous NiH, PdH, PtH series of molecules.},

  abstract = {In the present work we investigate the adequacy of broken-symmetry
	unrestricted density functional theory for constructing the potential
	energy curve of nickel dimer and nickel hydride, as a model for larger
	bare and hydrogenated nickel cluster calculations. We use three hybrid
	functionals: the popular B3LYP, Becke's newest optimized functional
	Becke98, and the simple FSLYP functional (50\% Hartree-Fock and 50\%
	Slater exchange and LYP gradient-corrected correlation functional)
	with two basis sets: all-electron (AE) Wachters+f basis set and Stuttgart
	RSC effective core potential (ECP) and basis set. We find that, overall,
	the best agreement with experiment, comparable to that of the high-level
	CASPT2, is obtained with B3LYP/AE, closely followed by Becke98/AE
	and Becke98/ECP. FSLYP/AE and B3LYP/ECP give slightly worse agreement
	with experiment, and FSLYP/ECP is the only method among the ones
	we studied that gives an unacceptably large error, underestimating
	the dissociation energy of Ni-2 by 28\%, and being in the largest
	disagreement with the experiment and the other theoretical predictions.
	We also find that for Ni-2, the spin projection for the broken-symmetry
	unrestricted singlet states changes the ordering of the states, but
	the splittings are less than 10 meV. All our calculations predict
	a deltadelta-hole ground state for Ni-2 and delta-hole ground state
	for NiH. Upon spin projection of the singlet state of Ni-2, almost
	all of our calculations: Becke98 and FSLYP both AE and ECP and B3LYP/AE
	predict (1)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y 2)(B)) or (1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B))
	ground state, which is a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and (1)Gamma(g).
	B3LYP/ECP predicts a (3)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(xy)(B)) (mixture of (3)Sigma(g)(-)
	and (3)Gamma(u)) ground state virtually degenerate with the (1)(d(x
	2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y 2)(B))/(1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B)) state. The doublet
	delta-hole ground state of NiH predicted by all our calculations
	is in agreement with the experimentally predicted (2)Delta ground
	state. For Ni-2, all our results are consistent with the experimentally
	predicted ground state of 0(g)(+) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and
	(3)Sigma(g)(-)) or 0(u)(-) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(u)(-) and (3)Sigma(u)(+)).},

  journal = JCP,
  year = {2010},
  volume = {133},
  abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium
	bond lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground
	state symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules
	comprised of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element
	(H, C, N, O, or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the
	key molecular bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic
	systems, but, at the same time, their small size permits a thorough
	study by even the most computationally expensive quantum chemistry
	approaches. The results of several density-functional theory (DFT)
	approaches including hybrid, generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient
	augmented with Hubbard U exchange-correlation functionals are presented.
	We compare these efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly
	accurate but computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches
	multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster
	{[}CCSD(T)] as well as experimental values, where available. We show
	that by employing a Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce
	average errors in state splittings and dissociation energies by a
	factor of 3. We are also able to reassign the ground state of four
	molecules improperly identified by hybrid or generalized-gradient
	approaches and provide correct assignment of all ground state symmetries
	as compared against experimental assignment and MRCI reference. By
	providing accuracy comparable to more expensive quantum chemistry
	approaches with the robust scaling of the generalized-gradient approximation,
	our DFT+U approach permits the study of very large scale systems
	with vastly improved results. (c) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

	of the electronic structure above E-F. The pressure dependence of

    abstract = { ABSTRACTSignatures of metal hydride molecules appear in the optical spectra of cool stars. The observed spectra are used not only for identification of the molecule, but also to assess the abundance of the metal from which the molecule is composed, and to measure the strength of the magnetic field in which the molecule is immersed through the Zeeman splitting of individual spectral lines. Metal hydrides are short-lived radicals, often produced via an electrical discharge, and their steady-state concentrations in a sample are low. High-sensitivity probing techniques, like laser-induced fluorescence, are often appropriate, but (typically much less sensitive) absorption techniques are more useful to assess metal abundances. We describe here a cavity ring-down spectroscopy experiment, usually used to detect absorptions from stable molecules, to collect spectra with very high sensitivity and reproducibility from prototypical metal hydrides NiH and NiD. We have constructed an optical cavity of high finesse (F = 60,000) into which a sputtering source is inserted, and have employed optical fibre and a rigid mounting scheme to keep the ring-down mirrors in alignment during an experiment and between days. We compare our NiH/NiD absorption data with literature results, and highlight some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. }
