Abstract = {{We report frequency measurements for relatively weak H$_2$O and $^{16}$O$_3$
   rotational transitions in the ground state and in the v(2) = 1
   vibrationally excited state. We obtained the frequency measurements by
   using the laboratory technique of tunable far-infrared spectroscopy with
   the objective of improving H$_2$O and O-3 line parameters required for
   modeling the important atmospheric spectral window near 119 cm(-1). New
   sets of molecular constants are calculated from the O-16(3) data, and
   improved values are reported for the frequencies of the H$_2$O lines. The
   improvement in atmospheric simulations obtained with the new results is
   illustrated by comparison with recent high-resolution balloon-based
   atmospheric measurements. These new data significantly improve
   simulations of high-resolution atmospheric emission spectra. }},

   transform spectrometer (FTS) of Reims and the usual experimental setup
   providing a large product p X l of approximately 38 Torr x 36 m. The
   upper levels of these A-type bands which are rather close in energy
   (they appear respectively at 5291.722 and 5307.790 cm(-1)) belong to two
   different sets of interacting polyads. To correctly reproduce the
   rotation-vibration energy levels and account for the observed
   perturbations, both bands are treated in a dyad approximation: the (123)
   state in the Coriolis resonance with the (330) state, and the (401)
   state in the Coriolis resonance with the (024) state. The assignments of
   the rotation-vibration levels of the (123) state are confirmed by
   measurements of line positions of the hot band nu(1) + 2 nu(2) + 3 nu(3)
   - nu(2) which has also been observed for the first time. The fits are
   very satisfactory: the r.m.s. deviation for 249 energy levels of the
   (123) state is 2.4 x 10(-3) cm(-1) and is 2.0 x 10(-3) cm(-1) for 266
   levels of the (401) state. These r.m.s. are near experimental accuracy.
   Transition moments for the three observed bands are determined from
   measured line intensities. }},

   an improvement of the r.m.s. deviation of the fit. This work allows us
   to observe a quasilinear variation of A(1 nu(2)l), B(1 nu(2)l) + C(1
   nu(2)1) and Delta(K)(1 upsilon(2)1) with respect to upsilon(2). This

   3300-3600 cm(-1) and 52005600 cm(-1), recorded by the Fourier Transform
   Spectrometer of Reims, with an improved signal/noise ratio. In the lower
   spectral range the weak 2v(1) + 2v(2) band is observed and assigned for
   the first time. This allowed for completing the triad of strongly
   interacting (220), (121), and (022) states. The resonance interaction
   parameters for this triad were derived from the molecular potential
   energy surface using high-order Contact Transformation method. This
   involves Darling-Dennison resonances between (220) and (022) vibration
   A-states, and Coriolis resonances between (121) B-state and A-states.
   Altogether 18 coupling parameters were fixed to these theoretically
   predicted values that allowed avoiding problems of ambiguities while
   fitting strongly correlated parameters. The remaining small
   perturbations of a few K-a=5 transitions of the v(1) + 2v(2) + v(3) band
   were explained by accidental Coriolis resonance of (121) with the (050)
   dark state. This mixed half theoretical/half empirical model (with 39
   fitted and 77 theoretically constrained parameters) developed in this
   work for the first time allows an excellent description of 1897 line
   positions with the rms deviation similar to 0.001 cm(-1) closed to the
   experimental precision. The intensities of two new hot bands v(2) +
   4v(3) - v(3) and v(1) + v(2) + 3v(3) - v(1) that fall in this range were
   also observed and modelled, thanks to a better signal to noise ratio.
   In addition, the 5200-5600 cm(-1) region has also been revisited,
   showing for the first time the (321) state which was considered as
   ``dark{''} one in the previous analysis. Effective Hamiltonian
   parameters were derived for strongly coupled (213)/(114)/(321) upper
   states including (080) as a dark one.
   The transition moment parameters of all newly observed and assigned
   bands were derived resulting to average rms deviation for intensities of
   similar to 8\% and 13\% for the cold and the hot bands, respectively, in
   the lower range and of similar to 15\% for the bands in the upper range
   that is close to experimental accuracy for weak transitions.}},

Abstract = {{The infrared spectra of O-16(3), in the range 1300-1500 cm(-1) have been
   recorded at high resolution (0.007 cm(-1)), with a large product p x 1 =
   32.4 Torr x 3212 cm, and a good S/N ratio congruent to 500. This enables
   us to observe the 2 nu(2) band with high values of rotational quantum
   numbers, respectively J less than or equal to 57 and K-a < 16, and also
   to observe for the first time the hot band 3 nu(2) - nu(2). The infrared
   data, combined with the 24 known microwave transitions in the (020)
   state, lead to a new set of Hamiltonian parameters. Statistical aspects
   of the simultaneous fit of microwave and infrared data are discussed and
   predictions of microwave transitions in the (020) state are given. The
   Hamiltonian parameters for (030) are reported, leading to an observation
   of a quasi linear dependence of rotational constants and the centrifugal
   distortion constant Delta(K) with respect to the nu(2) quantum number.
   Transition moment parameters are given for the 2 nu(2) and 3 nu(2) -
   nu(2) bands. A complete final calculation of line positions and
   intensities up to J less than or equal to 65 and K-a less than or equal

   equivalent absorption alpha(min) similar to 3 x 10(-10) cm(-1)), bands
   reaching a total of 16 upper vibrational states have been previously
   reported in selected spectral regions. In the present report, the
   analysis of the whole investigated region is completed by new recordings
   in three spectral regions which have allowed: (i) a refined analysis of
   the n(1) + 3n(2) + 3n(3) band from new spectra in the 5850 - 5900 cm(-1)
   region; (ii) an important extension of the assignments of the 2n(1) +
   5n(3) and 4n(1) + 2n(2) + n(3) bands in the 6500 - 6600 cm(-1) region,
   previously recorded by frequency modulation diode laser spectroscopy.
   The rovibrational assignments of the weak 4n(1) + 2n(2) + n(3) band were
   fully confirmed by the new observation of the 4n(1) + 2n(2) + n(3) -

   bands of ozone detected so far at high resolution. The upper vibrational
   states were assigned by comparison of their energy values with
   calculated values obtained from the ground state potential energy
   surface of (16)O(3). The vibrational mixing and consequently the
   ambiguities in the vibrational labelling are discussed. For each band or
   set of interacting bands, the spectroscopic parameters were determined
   from a fit of the corresponding line positions in the frame of the
   effective Hamiltonian ( EH) model. A set of selected absolute line
   intensities was measured and used to derive the parameters of the
   effective transition moment operator. The exhaustive review of the
   previous observations gathered with the present results is presented and
   discussed. It leads to a total number of 3863 energy levels belonging to
   21 vibrational states and corresponding to 7315 transitions. In the
   considered spectral region corresponding to up to 82\% of the
   dissociation energy, the increasing importance of the ``dark'' states is
   illustrated by the occurrence of frequent rovibrational perturbations
   and the observation of many weak lines still unassigned.}},

Abstract = {{Using a Fourier transform spectrometer, we have recorded the spectra of

   strongest absorption in this region is due to the nu(1) + nu(2) + 3
   nu(3) band which is in Coriolis interaction with the nu(2) + 4 nu(3)
   band. We have been able to assign more than 1700 transitions for these
   two bands. To correctly reproduce the calculation of energy levels, it
   has been necessary to introduce the (320) state which strongly perturbs
   the (113) and (014) states through Coriolis- and Fermi-type resonances.
   Seventy transitions of the 3 nu(1) + 2 nu(2) band have also been
   observed. The final fit on 926 energy levels with J(max) = 50 and K-max
   = 16 gives rms = 3.1 x 10(-3) cm(-1) and provides a satisfactory

   interactions between the levels of (005) and (104) and of (311) and
