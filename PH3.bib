	at 6.1 /~m and the va CH4 band at 3.3/~m. New measurements of Jupiter

	contributor to the continuum opacity in the window and in fact defines
	its short-wavelength limit. This has important implications for the
	use of 5-/zm observations as a means to probe the deep atmospheric
	structure of Jupiter. The abundance of PH3 which results from a comparison
	of Jovian and laboratory spectra is about 3 to 5 cm-am. This is five

  volume={816},
  pages={66},
  year={2016},
  abstract={We present a statistical analysis of the Kepler M dwarf planet hosts, with a particular focus on the fractional number of systems hosting multiple transiting planets. We manufacture synthetic planetary systems within a range of planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler yield. Similarly to studies of Kepler exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of singly transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a single population of multi-planet systems, a finding that cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 53 ± 10\% of planetary systems are either single or contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. The other 47 ± 10\% of systems contain ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/816/2/66/apj521700ieqn1.gif] {${7.5}_{-1.5}^{+0.5}$} planets with mutual inclinations of 2.°0 ± 1.°3. This mutual inclination range is consistent with studies of transit durations within multiply transiting systems. The mixture model is preferred 8:1 to a model with only one architecture. Thus, we find that the so-called “ Kepler dichotomy” holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs as well as Sun-like stars.}

  journal=ApJ,
  volume={814},
  pages={154},
  year={2015},
  abstract={We use solar occultations observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on board the Cassini Spacecraft to extract the 1–5 μ m transmission spectrum of Saturn, as if it were a transiting exoplanet. We detect absorption from methane, ethane, acetylene, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and possibly carbon monoxide, with peak-to-peak features of up to 90 parts-per-million despite the presence of ammonia clouds. We also find that atmospheric refraction, as opposed to clouds or haze, determines the minimum altitude that could be probed during mid-transit. Self-consistent exoplanet atmosphere models show good agreement with Saturn’s transmission spectrum but fail to reproduce a large absorption feature near 3.4 μ m, likely caused by gaseous ethane and a C–H stretching mode of an unknown aliphatic hydrocarbon. This large feature is located in one of the Spitzer Space Telescope bandpasses and could alter interpretations of transmission spectra if not properly modeled. The large signal in Saturn’s transmission spectrum suggests that transmission spectroscopy of cold, long-period gaseous exoplanets should be possible with current and future observatories. Motivated by these results, we briefly consider the feasibilityof using a survey to search for and characterize cold exoplanets that are analogous to Jupiter and Saturn utilizing a target-of-opportunity approach.}

	to be major impurities. They were separated from the sample; the

	The quadrupole fine structure associated with the absorption transitions
	for AsH2D is used to illustrate the special assumptions which may
	be made with these molecules having an axis of charge symmetry. These
	assumptions allow one to rotate the coordinate system from the chargesymmetry
	axes to the inertial axes without thereby adding unknown cross derivatives

	of the spectrum of SbH2D is more complicated. It is not found possible
	to fit the theory to the observed lines without making use of the
	second-order perturbations caused by a nearby level of different
	symmetry but of the same J. This perturbation involves the cross
	derivatives which had previously been assumed to be zero. With the
	assumption of cross derivatives approximately one percent of the
	diagonal terms, the theory fitted experiment within the experimental
	error. The electric quadrupole interaction in arsine and stibine
	is thus determined.
	
	In order to measure the electric dipole moment of arsine and stibine,
	a slight extension is made to the theory of asymmetric tops in a
	uniform electric field.
	
	The ground-state inversion splitting is determined to be less than
	0.5 Mc/sec for all three molecules.
	
	The rotational transitions observed were such that a determination

	A modified symmetric inversion potential is introduced to describe
	the inversion from the minimum C3v arrangement through the D3h transition
	state. Tunneling rates and frequencies are calculated at the Hartree-Fock
	and Moller-Plesset (MP2) level within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
	approximation. At the MP2 level the calculated 0+/0- v2 frequency
	splitting of the vibronic ground state of NH3/ND3 (0.729 cm -1/0.041
	cm-1) is in excellent agreement with the experimental values (0.794
	cm-1/0.053 cm-1). The tunneling rate for PH3 suggests that previously
	published values are wrong by orders of magnitude. Correlation effects
	do not change the barriers significantly in accordance with Freed's
	theorem. This has been studied in more detail for BiH3 at the quadratic
	configuration-interaction (QCI) level. Relativistic effects increase
	the barrier height of BiH3 by 81.6 kJ/mol at the QCI level. Nonrelativistic
	and relativistic extended Huckel calculations suggest that the a1
	highest occupied molecular orbital, which is antibonding to the Bi
	6s, relieves part of its antibonding character near equilibrium geometry
	due to the relativistic radial contraction of the 6s orbital and
	hence increases the barrier height. In the planar transition state
	this orbital is a nonbonding a2?. The increasing trend in barrier
	heights from NH3 to BiH3 can be explained by a second-order Jahn-Teller
	distortion of the trigonal planar geometry. Vibrational frequencies
	are predicted for BiH3.},

   transition wavenumbers). This is very remarkable since the calculations
   rely entirely on ab initio dipole moment surfaces and do not involve any
   adjustment of these surfaces to reproduce the experimental intensities.
   Finally, we predict the line strengths for transitions between so-called
   cluster levels (near-degenerate levels formed at high rotational
   excitation) for J up to 60.},

abstract = "Abstract New dipole moment surfaces (DMS) of phosphine are constructed using extended ab initio CCSD(T) (CCSD(T)-F12) calculations at 11 697 nuclear configurations. The \{DMS\} analytical representation is determined through an expansion in symmetry adapted products of internal nonlinear coordinates up to the 8th order. Including high order terms permits significantly reducing the fit errors for ab initio dipole moment values in a large range of nuclear geometries. Rovibrational line strengths in the infrared are variationally computed from \{DMS\} using normal mode Eckart frame approach. Comparison of results obtained with four basis sets up to \{V5Z\} is presented. Integrated intensities of four lower \{PH3\} polyads up to J = 20 are in a good agreement with the \{HITRAN\} 2012 database and with available spectroscopic data analyses. A particular focus of the study is the Octad range (2650–3700 cm−1) containing eight interacting bands 3ν2, 2ν2 + ν4, ν2 + 2ν4, ν1 + ν2, ν2 + ν3, 3ν4, ν3 + ν4 and ν1 + ν4, where new ab initio predictions are expected to help further analyses of experimental spectra.
