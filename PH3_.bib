  abstract = {An accurate and comprehensive room temperature rotation-vibration
	transition line list for phosphine (({PH$_3$})-P-31) is computed using
	a newly refined potential energy surface and a previously constructed
	ab initio electric dipole moment surface. Energy levels, Einstein
	A coefficients and transition intensities are computed using these
	surfaces and a variational approach to the nuclear motion problem
	as implemented in the program TROVE. A to-vibrational spectrum is
	computed, covering the wavenumber range 0-8000 {cm$^{-1}$}. The resulting
	line list, which is appropriate for temperatures up to 300 K, consists
	of a total of 137 million transitions between 5.6 million energy
	levels. Several of the band centres are shifted to better match experimental
	transition frequencies. The line list is compared to the most recent
	HITRAN database and other laboratorial sources. Transition wavelengths
	and intensities are generally found to be in good agreement with
	the existing experimental data, with particularly close agreement
	for the rotational spectrum. An analysis of the comparison between
	the theoretical data created and the existing experimental data is
	performed, and suggestions for future improvements and assignments
	to the HITRAN database are made. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {High temperature partition functions and thermodynamic data for ammonia
   and phosphine},

Pages = {66-74},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The total internal partition function of ammonia ((NH3)-N-14) and
   phosphine ((PH3)-P-31) are calculated as a function of temperature by
   explicit summation of 153 million (for {PH$_3$}) and 75 million (for NH3)
   theoretical rotation-vibrational energy levels. High accuracy estimates
   are obtained for the specific heat capacity, C-p, the Gibbs enthalpy
   function, gef, the Helmholtz function, hcf, and the entropy, S, of gas
   phase molecules as a function of temperature. In order to reduce the
   computational costs associated with the high rotational excitations,
   only the A-symmetry energy levels are used above a certain threshold of
   the total angular momentum number J. With this approach levels are
   summed up to dissociation energy for values of J(max)=45 and 100 for
   ammonia (E-max=41 051 {cm$^{-1}$}) and phosphine (E-max=28 839.7 {cm$^{-1}$}),
   respectively. Estimates of the partition function are converged for all
   temperatures considered for phosphine and below 3000 K for ammonia. All
   other thermodynamic properties are converged to at least 2000 K for
   ammonia and fully converged for phosphine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All
