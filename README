This file describes the convention for assigning keys to BibTex entries.

ARTICLES
========
The general format is the following
XYZ##a

X = first author
Y = second author
Z = third author
## = the last two digits of the year
a = an increment used when more than one entry has the same key. starts with
	"a" then "b" then "c", etc. This can omitted if it is not needed to
	differentiate entries. 

-If there is only one author, Y and Z are omitted
-If there are only two authors, Z is omitted.
-For pre 1920's papers the full year is to be used, ie #### instead of
 ##
