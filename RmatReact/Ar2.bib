Abstract = {{An ab initio potential has been developed for the argon dimer. This
   potential is based on coupled-cluster calculations with single, double,
   and non-iterated triple excitations in a sequence of very large basis
   sets, up to augmented sextuple-zeta quality and containing bond
   functions, followed by extrapolations to the complete basis set limit.
   The calculations included intermolecular distances as small as 0.25
   angstrom, where the interaction potential is of the order of 4 keV. The
   computed points were fitted by an analytic expression. The new potential
   has the minimum at 3.767 angstrom with a depth of 99.27 cm(-1)
   respectively, very close to experimental values of 3.761 +/- 0.003
   angstrom and 99.2 +/- 1.0 cm(-1) respectively. The potential was used to
   compute the spectra of the argon dimer and the virial coeffcients. The
   latter calculations suggest a possible revision of the established
   experimental reference results. From the agreement achieved with
   experimental values and from comparisons of the fit with available
   piecewise information on specific regions of the argon - argon
   interaction, one can assume that the present work provides the best
   overall representation of the true argon - argon potential to date.}},

Abstract={{We trap cold, ground state argon atoms in a deep optical dipole trap produced by a buildup cavity. The atoms, which are a general source for the sympathetic cooling of molecules, are loaded in the trap by quenching them from a cloud of laser-cooled metastable argon atoms. Although the ground state atoms cannot be directly probed, we detect them by observing the collisional loss of cotrapped metastable argon atoms and determine an elastic cross section. Using a type of parametric loss spectroscopy we also determine the polarizability of the metastable 4s[3/2]2 state to be (7.3±1.1)×10−39  C m2/V. Finally, Penning and associative losses of metastable atoms in the absence of light assisted collisions, are determined to be (3.3±0.8)×10−10  cm3 s−1.}}
