   Quantum reactive calculations for similar to R-4 long range interaction
   potentials}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Abstract = {{Quantum reactive and elastic cross sections and rate coefficients have
   been calculated for D+ + H-2 (v = 0, j = 0) collisions in the energy
   range from 10(-8) K (deep ultracold regime), where only one partial wave
   is open, to 150 K (Langevin regime) where many of them contribute. In
   systems involving ions, the similar to R-4 behavior extends the
   interaction up to extremely long distances, requiring a special
   treatment. To this purpose, we have used a modified version of the
   hyperspherical quantum reactive scattering method, which allows the
   propagations up to distances of 10(5) a(0) needed to converge the
   elastic cross sections. Interpolation procedures are also proposed which
   may reduce the cost of exact dynamical calculations at such low
   energies. Calculations have been carried out on the PES by Velilla et
   al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 129, 084307 (2008)] which accurately reproduces
   the long range interactions. Results on its prequel, the PES by Aguado
   et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 112, 1240 (2000)], are also shown in order to
   emphasize the significance of the inclusion of the long range
   interactions. The calculated reaction rate coefficient changes less than
   one order of magnitude in a collision energy range of ten orders of
   magnitude, and it is found in very good agreement with the available
   experimental data in the region where they exist (10-100 K).
   State-to-state reaction probabilities are also provided which show that
   for each partial wave, the distribution of HD final states remains
   essentially constant below 1 K. }},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Abstract = {{Rotationally resolved reaction probabilities, integral cross sections,
   and rate constant for the H+ + H-2 (v = 0, j = 0 or 1) -> H-2 (v' = 0,

   {[}J. Chem. Phys. 116, 654 (2002)] (say KBNN PES). All partial wave
   contributions of the total angular momentum, J, are included to obtain
   converged cross sections at low collision energies and rate constants at
   low temperatures. In order to test the accuracy of the KBNN PES, the
   results obtained here are compared with those obtained in our earlier
   work {[}P. Honvault et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 023201 (2011)] using
   the accurate potential energy surface of Velilla et al. {[}J. Chem.
   Phys. 129, 084307 (2008)]. Integral cross sections and rate constants
   obtained on the two potential energy surfaces considered here show
   remarkable differences in terms of magnitude and dependence on collision
   energy (or temperature) which can be attributed to the differences
   observed in the topography of the surfaces near to the entrance channel.
   This clearly shows the inadequacy of the KBNN PES for calculations at
   low collision energies.}},

Abstract = {{H-3(+) plays a crucial role in Astrophysics, taking part in the early

   Association processes to form H-3(+) and dissociative recombination with

   the observed abundance of the molecule in the interstellar medium.
   Besides all these questions, in this work, we review some of the most

   isotopic variants. A discussion on the most commonly found numerical

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the D+ + H-2 --> HD + H+ reaction on a recent ab initio

   investigated by means of a time-independent quantum mechanical approach.
   Cross sections and rate coefficients are calculated, 5 respectively, for
   collision energies below 0.1 eV and temperatures up to 100 K for
   astrophysical application. An excellent accord is found for collision
   energy above 5 meV, while a disagreement between theory and experiment
   is observed below this energy. We show that the rate coefficients reveal
   a slightly temperature-dependent behavior in the upper part of the
   temperature range considered here. This is in agreement with the
   experimental data above 80 K, which give a temperature independent
   Value. However, a significant decrease is found at temperatures below 20
   K. This decrease can be related to quantum effects and the decay back to
   the reactant channel, which are not considered by simple statistical
   approaches, such as the Langevin model. Our results have been fitted to
   appropriate analytical expressions in order to be used in astrochemical
   and cosmological models.}},

Title = {{State Specific Stabilization of H+ + H-2(j) Collision Complexes}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {10068-10075},
Abstract = {{Stabilization of H-3(+) collision complexes has been studied at nominal
   temperatures between 11 and 33 K using a 22-pole radio frequency (rf)
   ion trap. Apparent binary rate coefficients, k{*} = k(r) + k(3){[}H-2],
   have been measured for para- and normal-hydrogen at number densities
   between some 10(11) and 10(14) cm(-3). The state specific rate
   coefficients extracted for radiative stabilization, k(r)(T-ij), are all
   below 2 x 10(-16) cm(3) s(-1). There is a slight tendency to decrease
   with increasing temperature. In contrast to simple expectations, k(r)(11
   K-ij) is for j = 0 a factor of 2 smaller than for j = 1. The ternary
   rate coefficients for p-H-2 show a rather steep T-dependence; however,
   they are increasing with temperature. The state specific ternary rate
   coefficients, k(3)(T-ij), measured for j = 0 and derived for j = 1 from
   measurements with n-H-2, differ by an order of magnitude. Most of these
   surprising observations are in disagreement with predictions from
   standard association models, which are based on statistical assumptions
   and the separation of complex formation and competition between
   stabilization and decay. Most probably, the unexpected collision
   dynamics are due to the fact that, at the low translational energies of
   the present experiment, only a small number of partial waves
   participate. This should make exact quantum mechanical calculations of
   k(r) feasible. More complex is three-body stabilization, because it
   occurs on the H-5(+) potential energy surface.}},
