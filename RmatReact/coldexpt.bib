    abstract = { Over the past decade, and particularly the past five years, a quiet revolution has been building at the border between atomic physics and experimental quantum chemistry. The rapid development of techniques for producing cold and even ultracold molecules without a perturbing rare-gas cluster shell is now enabling the study of chemical reactions and scattering at the quantum scattering limit with only a few partial waves contributing to the incident channel. Moreover, the ability to perform these experiments with nonthermal distributions comprising one or a few specific states enables the observation and even full control of state-to-state collision rates in this computation-friendly regime: This is perhaps the most elementary study possible of scattering and reaction dynamics. }

   temperatures}},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{395}},
Pages = {148-150},
Abstract = {{Recent advances(1-5) in the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of
   atoms to nanokelvin temperatures have opened important areas of
   research, such as Bose-Einstein condensation and ultracold atomic
   collisions. Similarly, the ability to trap and cool molecules should
   facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions(6);
   improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also,
   ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of
   elementary particles(7). But although laser cooling (in the case of
   alkali metals(1,8,9)) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case
   of hydrogen(10,11)) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently
   to permit their loading into magnetic trays, such techniques are not
   applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal
   energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by
   these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading technique(12)
   based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and have used it to
   trap atomic chromium and europium(13,14). Here we apply this technique
   to magnetically trap a molecular species-calcium monohydride (CaH). We
   use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number of trapped molecules and
   their temperature, and set upper bounds on the cross-sectional areas of
   collisional relaxation processes. The technique should he applicable to
   many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.}},

Abstract = {{We report the creation of a sample of over 1000 ultracold Rb87Cs133 molecules in the lowest rovibrational ground state, from an atomic mixture of Rb87 and Cs133, by magnetoassociation on an interspecies Feshbach resonance followed by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We measure the binding energy of the RbCs molecule to be hc×3811.576(1)  cm−1 and the |v''=0,J''=0⟩ to |v''=0,J''=2⟩ splitting to be h×2940.09(6)  MHz. Stark spectroscopy of the rovibrational ground state yields an electric dipole moment of 1.225(3)(8) D, where the values in parentheses are the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. We can access a space-fixed dipole moment of 0.355(2)(4) D, which is substantially higher than in previous work.}}

  title={{Quantum dynamics of O( 1 D)+D 2 reaction: isotope and vibrational excitation effects}},
  journal=JPB,
  volume={47},
  pages={135202},
  year={2014},
  abstract={The effect of initial vibrational excitation of the D 2 molecule on the quantum dynamics of the O( 1 D )+D 2 reaction is investigated as a function of collision energy. The potential energy surface of Dobbyn and Knowles (1997 Mol. Phys. 91 1107) and a time-independent quantum mechanical method based on hyperspherical coordinates have been adopted for the dynamics calculations. Results for elastic, inelastic, and reactive scattering over collision energies ranging from the ultracold to thermal regimes are reported for total angular momentum quantum number J = 0. Calculations show that the collisional outcome of the O( 1 D )+D 2 reaction is not strongly influenced by the initial vibrational excitation of the D 2 molecule similar to its H 2 counterpart. A J -shifting approximation is used to calculate the initial state selected reactive rate coefficients over the temperature range T = 1 ? 500 K. The reactive rate coefficients for D 2 ( v = 0) are found to be in excellent agreement with available experimental results. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect is also investigated and its value at room temperature is found to be in good agreement with available theoretical and experimental results.},
