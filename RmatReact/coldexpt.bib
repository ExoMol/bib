    abstract = { Over the past decade, and particularly the past five years, a quiet revolution has been building at the border between atomic physics and experimental quantum chemistry. The rapid development of techniques for producing cold and even ultracold molecules without a perturbing rare-gas cluster shell is now enabling the study of chemical reactions and scattering at the quantum scattering limit with only a few partial waves contributing to the incident channel. Moreover, the ability to perform these experiments with nonthermal distributions comprising one or a few specific states enables the observation and even full control of state-to-state collision rates in this computation-friendly regime: This is perhaps the most elementary study possible of scattering and reaction dynamics. }

   temperatures}},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{395}},
Pages = {148-150},
Abstract = {{Recent advances(1-5) in the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of
   atoms to nanokelvin temperatures have opened important areas of
   research, such as Bose-Einstein condensation and ultracold atomic
   collisions. Similarly, the ability to trap and cool molecules should
   facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions(6);
   improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also,
   ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of
   elementary particles(7). But although laser cooling (in the case of
   alkali metals(1,8,9)) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case
   of hydrogen(10,11)) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently
   to permit their loading into magnetic trays, such techniques are not
   applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal
   energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by
   these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading technique(12)
   based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and have used it to
   trap atomic chromium and europium(13,14). Here we apply this technique
   to magnetically trap a molecular species-calcium monohydride (CaH). We
   use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number of trapped molecules and
   their temperature, and set upper bounds on the cross-sectional areas of
   collisional relaxation processes. The technique should he applicable to
   many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.}},

Abstract = {{We report the creation of a sample of over 1000 ultracold Rb87Cs133 molecules in the lowest rovibrational ground state, from an atomic mixture of Rb87 and Cs133, by magnetoassociation on an interspecies Feshbach resonance followed by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We measure the binding energy of the RbCs molecule to be hc×3811.576(1)  cm−1 and the |v''=0,J''=0⟩ to |v''=0,J''=2⟩ splitting to be h×2940.09(6)  MHz. Stark spectroscopy of the rovibrational ground state yields an electric dipole moment of 1.225(3)(8) D, where the values in parentheses are the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively. We can access a space-fixed dipole moment of 0.355(2)(4) D, which is substantially higher than in previous work.}}

Journal=ARPC,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {475-495},
Abstract = {{Coulomb crystals-as a source of translationally cold, highly localized
   ions-are being increasingly utilized in the investigation of
   ion-molecule reaction dynamics in the cold regime. To develop a
   fundamental understanding of ion-molecule reactions, and to challenge
   existing models that describe the rates, product branching ratios, and
   temperature dependence of such processes, investigators need to exercise
   full control over the experimental reaction parameters. This requires
   not only state selection of the reactants, but also control over the
   collision process (e.g., the collisional energy and angular momentum)
   and state-selective product detection. The combination of Coulomb
   crystals in ion traps with cold neutral-molecule sources is enabling the
   measurement of state-selective reaction rates in a diverse range of
   systems. With the development of appropriate product detection
   techniques, we are moving toward the ultimate goal of examining
   low-energy, state-to-state ion-molecule reaction dynamics.}},

   molecules}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of a range of techniques for producing cold atoms
   and molecules at very low translational temperatures T <= 1 K has
   provided the opportunity to investigate collisional processes in a new
   physical regime. We have recently presented a new experimental method to
   study low-temperature reactive collisions between translationally cold
   ions and neutral molecules (S. Willitsch et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008,
   100, 043203). Our technique relies on the combination of a
   quadrupole-guide velocity selector for the generation of translationally
   cold neutral molecules with a facility to produce ordered structures of
   cold ions (Coulomb crystals) by laser cooling in a linear quadrupole ion
   trap. The strong localisation of the ions in the trap in combination
   with the high sensitivity of laser-induced-fluorescence detection
   enabled us to study chemical reactions on the single-particle level,
   down to temperatures of T approximate to 1 K. In the current paper, we
   present a detailed characterisation of the scope and limitations of this
   method based on our study of the reaction between laser-cooled Ca+ ions
   and velocity-selected CH3F molecules. The properties of our
   cold-neutrals source and the dependence of the measured rate constant on
   the shape of the Coulomb crystals, trapping and laser-cooling parameters
   are discussed. An extension of our technique for the study of
   low-temperature reactions with sympathetically cooled molecular ions
   (translational temperature T > 10 mK) is presented and first results on
   the charge-transfer reaction between OCS+ and ND3 are discussed.
   Finally, perspectives for further developments of our method are
   explored.}},
