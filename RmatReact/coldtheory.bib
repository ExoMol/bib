Title = {{Non-adiabatic quantum reactive scattering in hyperspherical coordinates}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{148}},
Abstract = {{A new electronically non-adiabatic quantum reactive scattering
   methodology is presented based on a time-independent coupled channel
   formalism and the adiabatically adjusting principal axis hyperspherical
   coordinates of T Pack and Parker {[}J. Chem. Phys. 87, 3888 (1987)]. The
   methodology computes the full state-to-state scattering matrix for A +
   B-2(v, j) <-> AB(v', j') + B and A+ AB(v, j) -> A + AB(v' , j')
   reactions that involve two coupled electronic states which exhibit a
   conical intersection. The methodology accurately treats all six degrees
   of freedom relative to the center-of-mass which includes non-zero total
   angular momentum J and identical particle exchange symmetry. The new
   methodology is applied to the ultracold hydrogen exchange reaction for
   which large geometric phase effects have been recently reported {[}B. K.
   Kendrick et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 153201 (2015)]. Rate coefficients
   for the H/D + HD(v = 4, j = 0) -> H/D + HD(v', j') reactions are
   reported for collision energies between 1 mu K and 100 K (total energy
   approximate to 1.9 eV). A new diabatic potential energy matrix is
   developed based on the Boothroyd, Keogh, Martin, and Peterson (BKMP2)
   and double many body expansion plus single-polynomial (DSP) adiabatic
   potential energy surfaces for the ground and first excited electronic
   states of H-3, respectively. The rate coefficients computed using the
   new non-adiabatic methodology and diabatic potential matrix reproduce
   the recently reported rates that include the geometric phase and are
   computed using a single adiabatic ground electronic state potential
   energy surface (BKMP2). The dramatic enhancement and suppression of the
   ultracold rates due to the geometric phase are confirmed as well as its
   effects on several shape resonances near 1 K. The results reported here
   represent the first fully non-adiabatic quantum reactive scattering
   calculation for an ultracold reaction and validate the importance of the
   geometric phase on the Wigner threshold behavior. }},

Title = {{Scattering of ultracold molecules in the highly resonant regime}},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Abstract = {{Compared to purely atomic collisions, ultracold molecular collisions
   potentially support a much larger number of Fano-Feshbach resonances due
   to the enormous number of rovibrational states available. In fact, for
   alkali-metal dimers we find that the resulting density of resonances
   cannot be resolved at all, even on the sub-mu K temperature scale of
   ultracold experiments. As a result, all observables become averaged over
   many resonances and can effectively be described by simpler, nonresonant
   scattering calculations. Two particular examples are discussed:
   nonchemically reactive RbCs and chemically reactive KRb. In the former
   case, the formation of a long-lived collision complex may lead to the
   ejection of molecules from a trap. In the latter case, chemical
   reactions broaden the resonances so much that they become unobservable.

Different transitions are considered, especially the ortho-para conversion (j=1→j′=0) which is of key importance in astrophysics. This conversion process appears to be very efficient and dominant at low temperature, with a rate coefficient of 4.15×10−10  cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at 10 K. The quantum mechanical results are also compared with statistical quantum predictions and the reaction is found to be statistical in the low temperature regime (T<100  K).}}

abstract = {{Quantum reactive and elastic cross sections and rate coefficients have been calculated for D+ + H2 (v = 0, j = 0) collisions in the energy range from 10−8 K (deep ultracold regime), where only one partial wave is open, to 150 K (Langevin regime) where many of them contribute. In systems involving ions, the ∼R−4 behavior extends the interaction up to extremely long distances, requiring a special treatment. To this purpose, we have used a modified version of the hyperspherical quantum reactive scattering method, which allows the propagations up to distances of 105 a0 needed to converge the elastic cross sections. Interpolation procedures are also proposed which may reduce the cost of exact dynamical calculations at such low energies. Calculations have been carried out on the PES by Velilla et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 084307 (2008)] which accurately reproduces the long range interactions. Results on its prequel, the PES by Aguado et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 1240 (2000)], are also shown in order to emphasize the significance of the inclusion of the long range interactions. The calculated reaction rate coefficient changes less than one order of magnitude in a collision energy range of ten orders of magnitude, and it is found in very good agreement with the available experimental data in the region where they exist (10-100 K). State-to-state reaction probabilities are also provided which show that for each partial wave, the distribution of HD final states remains essentially constant below 1 K.}}}

  abstract={The effect of initial vibrational excitation of the D 2 molecule on the quantum dynamics of the O( 1 D )+D 2 reaction is investigated as a function of collision energy. The potential energy surface of Dobbyn and Knowles (1997 Mol. Phys. 91 1107) and a time-independent quantum mechanical method based on hyperspherical coordinates have been adopted for the dynamics calculations. Results for elastic, inelastic, and reactive scattering over collision energies ranging from the ultracold to thermal regimes are reported for total angular momentum quantum number J = 0. Calculations show that the collisional outcome of the O( 1 D )+D 2 reaction is not strongly influenced by the initial vibrational excitation of the D 2 molecule similar to its H 2 counterpart. A J -shifting approximation is used to calculate the initial state selected reactive rate coefficients over the temperature range T = 1 ? 500 K. The reactive rate coefficients for D 2 ( v = 0) are found to be in excellent agreement with available experimental results. The temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect is also investigated and its value at room temperature is found to be in good agreement with available theoretical and experimental results.},

Abstract = {{H-3(+) plays a crucial role in Astrophysics, taking part in the early
   chemistry responsible for the formation of the stars. It is also one of
   the most abundant ionic species in hydrogen plasmas. The spectroscopy of

   Association processes to form H-3(+) and dissociative recombination with
   electrons have also been investigated in detail in order to understand
   the observed abundance of the molecule in the interstellar medium.
   Besides all these questions, in this work, we review some of the most
   relevant aspects regarding the dynamics of the H+ + H-2 reaction and its
   isotopic variants. A discussion on the most commonly found numerical
   difficulties in the theoretical study of this reactive collision is
