Abstract = {{Compared to purely atomic collisions, ultracold molecular collisions
   potentially support a much larger number of Fano-Feshbach resonances due
   to the enormous number of rovibrational states available. In fact, for
   alkali-metal dimers we find that the resulting density of resonances
   cannot be resolved at all, even on the sub-mu K temperature scale of
   ultracold experiments. As a result, all observables become averaged over
   many resonances and can effectively be described by simpler, nonresonant
   scattering calculations. Two particular examples are discussed:
   nonchemically reactive RbCs and chemically reactive KRb. In the former
   case, the formation of a long-lived collision complex may lead to the
   ejection of molecules from a trap. In the latter case, chemical
   reactions broaden the resonances so much that they become unobservable.
