    abstract = {This review discusses recent quantum scattering calculations on bimolecular chemical reactions in the gas phase. This theory provides detailed and accurate predictions on the dynamics and kinetics of reactions containing three atoms. In addition, the method can now be applied to reactions involving polyatomic molecules. Results obtained with both time-independent and time-dependent quantum dynamical methods are described. The review emphasises the recent development in time-dependent wave packet theories and the applications of reduced dimensionality approaches for treating polyatomic reactions. Calculations on over 40 different reactions are described. }

abstract = {The theory of reactive (rearrangement) scattering for three atoms in three physical dimensions using adiabatically adjusting, principal axes hyperspherical (APH) coordinates is given. The relationships of the APH coordinates to Delves and Jacobi coordinates are given, and the kinetic energy operator is shown to be relatively simple. Procedures for solving the equations via either an exact coupled channel (CC) method or an optimum centrifugal sudden (CSAPH) approximation are given as well as procedures for applying scatteringboundary conditions. Surface functions of two angles are obtained using a finite element method with an optimized, nonuniform mesh, and the CC equations are solved using the efficient VIVAS method. Sample CC results are given for the H3 system. The present approach has the advantages that all arrangements are treated fully equivalently; it is a principal axis system, so that both axes and internal coordinates swing smoothly with the reactions; it is directly applicable to both symmetric and unsymmetric systems and mass combinations and all total angular momenta; it gives convenient mappings for visualization of potential energy surfaces and wave functions; only regular radial solutions are required; all coordinate matching is by simple projection; and the expensive parts of the calculation are energy independent, so that, once they are done, the scattering matrices can be rapidly generated at the large numbers of energies needed to map out reactive thresholds and resonances. Accurate reactive scattering calculations are now possible for many chemically interesting reactions that were previously intractable.}

The present theory makes use of radial basis functions which satisfy arbitrary conditions at the R‐matrix boundary. At the same time within the boundary, the basis functions are eigenfunctions of a realistic effective radial Hamiltonian. Consequently, the radial basis set is slightly nonorthogonal. It is shown that this is sufficient to afford a rapidly convergent expansion which remains reliable both in the neighborhood of and far from resonances. The Buttle correction is no longer needed. The method is applied to a problem of collinear collisions between an atom and a diatomic molecule. Results are in excellent agreement with previous calculations.}}}

Abstract = {{Several techniques of varying efficiency are investigated, which treat
   all singularities present in the triatomic vibrational kinetic energy
   operator given in orthogonal internal coordinates of the two
   distances-one angle type. The strategies are based on the use of a
   direct-product basis built from one-dimensional discrete variable
   representation (DVR) bases corresponding to the two distances and
   orthogonal Legendre polynomials, or the corresponding Legendre-DVR
   basis, corresponding to the angle. The use of Legendre functions ensures
   the efficient treatment of the angular singularity. Matrix elements of
   the singular radial operators are calculated employing DVRs using the
   quadrature approximation as well as special DVRs satisfying the boundary
   conditions and thus allowing for the use of exact DVR expressions.
   Potential optimized ( PO) radial DVRs, based on one-dimensional
   Hamiltonians with potentials obtained by fixing or relaxing the two
   non-active coordinates, are also studied. The numerical calculations
   employed Hermite-DVR, spherical-oscillator-DVR, and Bessel-DVR bases as
   the primitive radial functions. A new analytical formula is given for
   the determination of the matrix elements of the singular radial operator
   using the Bessel-DVR basis. The usually claimed failure of the
   quadrature approximation in certain singular integrals is revisited in
   one and three dimensions. It is shown that as long as no potential
   optimization is carried out the quadrature approximation works almost as
   well as the exact DVR expressions. If wave functions with finite
   amplitude at the boundary are to be computed, the basis sets need to
   meet the required boundary conditions. The present numerical results
   also confirm that PO-DVRs should be constructed employing relaxed
   potentials and PO-DVRs can be useful for optimizing quadrature points
   for calculations applying large coordinate intervals and describing
   large-amplitude motions. The utility and efficiency of the different
   algorithms is demonstrated by the computation of converged
   near-dissociation vibrational energy levels for the H-3(+) molecular
   ion.}},

   suggested that, for increasingly floppy molecules, its efficiency will
   be increasingly competitive with that of contracted-basis
   explicit-diagonalization methods if one can overcome the problem of poor
   Lanczos convergence caused by kinetic energy singularities. This may be
   accomplished through the realization that nondirect product finite basis
   representations (FBRs) (and the related DVRs) can be used efficiently in
   dynamics calculations for which the rate-determining step is the
   evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix-vector products, as is the case with
   Lanczos recursion {[}J. W. Tromp and G. C. Corey, J. Chem. Phys. (to be
   submitted); D. Lemoine and G. C. Corey, J. Chem. Phys. (to be

   near-optimally efficient variational vibrational method for molecules
   for which good basis contraction schemes cannot be designed, and for
   which the inevitable coordinate singularities require ideally a
   nondirect product basis. To substantiate this claim, we have performed
   hybrid DVR/FBR Lanczos calculations of vibrational energies of the
   classic floppy triatomic molecule H-3(+) up to near dissociation with
   unprecedently good convergence and unprecedently low computational cost.}},
