abstract={{We report accurate vibrational energy levels of H2O((X) over tilde (1)A') up to the dissociation limit on a recent ab initio potential energy surface of Partridge and Schwenke. Eigenvalues of the exact vibrational Hamiltonian in the Radau coordinates were obtained using the Lanczos algorithm. To improve computational efficiency, we utilized the extended symmetry-adapted discrete variable representation for the angular kinetic energy operator and adapted the hydro, gen exchange symmetry in the radial coordinates using an index-swapping scheme. Normal mode assignments have been made to vibrational levels up to 20000 cm(-1), and several (local mode) stretching overtones up to the dissociation limit have been identified. Agreement with available experimental data is excellent.}},

Title = {{On the efficiency of treating singularities in triatomic variational
   vibrational computations. The vibrational states of H-3(+) up to
   dissociation}},
Journal = PCCP,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {8373-8386},
Abstract = {{Several techniques of varying efficiency are investigated, which treat
   all singularities present in the triatomic vibrational kinetic energy
   operator given in orthogonal internal coordinates of the two
   distances-one angle type. The strategies are based on the use of a
   direct-product basis built from one-dimensional discrete variable
   representation (DVR) bases corresponding to the two distances and
   orthogonal Legendre polynomials, or the corresponding Legendre-DVR
   basis, corresponding to the angle. The use of Legendre functions ensures
   the efficient treatment of the angular singularity. Matrix elements of
   the singular radial operators are calculated employing DVRs using the
   quadrature approximation as well as special DVRs satisfying the boundary
   conditions and thus allowing for the use of exact DVR expressions.
   Potential optimized ( PO) radial DVRs, based on one-dimensional
   Hamiltonians with potentials obtained by fixing or relaxing the two
   non-active coordinates, are also studied. The numerical calculations
   employed Hermite-DVR, spherical-oscillator-DVR, and Bessel-DVR bases as
   the primitive radial functions. A new analytical formula is given for
   the determination of the matrix elements of the singular radial operator
   using the Bessel-DVR basis. The usually claimed failure of the
   quadrature approximation in certain singular integrals is revisited in
   one and three dimensions. It is shown that as long as no potential
   optimization is carried out the quadrature approximation works almost as
   well as the exact DVR expressions. If wave functions with finite
   amplitude at the boundary are to be computed, the basis sets need to
   meet the required boundary conditions. The present numerical results
   also confirm that PO-DVRs should be constructed employing relaxed
   potentials and PO-DVRs can be useful for optimizing quadrature points
   for calculations applying large coordinate intervals and describing
   large-amplitude motions. The utility and efficiency of the different
   algorithms is demonstrated by the computation of converged
   near-dissociation vibrational energy levels for the H-3(+) molecular
   ion.}},

   suggested that, for increasingly floppy molecules, its efficiency will
   be increasingly competitive with that of contracted-basis
   explicit-diagonalization methods if one can overcome the problem of poor
   Lanczos convergence caused by kinetic energy singularities. This may be
   accomplished through the realization that nondirect product finite basis
   representations (FBRs) (and the related DVRs) can be used efficiently in
   dynamics calculations for which the rate-determining step is the
   evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix-vector products, as is the case with
   Lanczos recursion {[}J. W. Tromp and G. C. Corey, J. Chem. Phys. (to be
   submitted); D. Lemoine and G. C. Corey, J. Chem. Phys. (to be
   published)]. A synthesis of these two procedures provides a
   near-optimally efficient variational vibrational method for molecules
   for which good basis contraction schemes cannot be designed, and for
   which the inevitable coordinate singularities require ideally a
   nondirect product basis. To substantiate this claim, we have performed
   hybrid DVR/FBR Lanczos calculations of vibrational energies of the
   classic floppy triatomic molecule H-3(+) up to near dissociation with
   unprecedently good convergence and unprecedently low computational cost.}},

Title = {{Low-lying quasibound rovibrational states of H-2 O-16({*}{*})}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {2131-2146},
Abstract = {{A complex coordinate scaling (CCS) method is described allowing the
   quantum chemical computation of quasibound (also called resonance or
   metastable) rovibrational states of strongly bound triatomic molecules.
   The molecule chosen to test the method is H-2 O-16, for which an
   accurate global potential energy surface, a previous computation of a
   few resonance states via the complex absorbing potential (CAP) method,
   and some Feshbach (J = 0, where J is the quantum number characterising
   overall rotations of the molecule) and shape (J 0) resonances measured
   via a state-selective, triple-resonance technique are all available.
   Characterisation of the computed resonance states is performed via
   probability density plots based on CCS rovibrational wavefunctions. Such
   plots provide useful details about the physical nature of the resonance
   states. Based on the computations and the resonance plots, the following
   useful facts about the resonance states investigated are obtained: (a)
   Feshbach resonances are formed by accumulation of a large amount of
   energy in either the non-dissociative bending or symmetric streching
   modes, excitations by more than five quanta are not uncommon; (b) there
   are several resonance states with low and medium bending excitation, the
   latter are different from the states observed somewhat below
   dissociation by the same triple-resonance technique; (c) several types
   of dissociation bahavior can be identified, varying greatly among the
   states; (d) several pairs of J = 0 and J = 1 Feshbach resonance states
   can be identified which differ by rigid-rotor type energies; and (e) the
   lifetimes of the assigned J = 1 rovibrational Feshbach resonances are
   considerably longer than the lifetimes of their J = 0 vibrational
   counterparts.}},
