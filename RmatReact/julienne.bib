	Abstract = {We report on the Bose-Einstein condensation of more than 105 Li2 molecules in an optical trap starting from a spin mixture of fermionic lithium atoms. During forced evaporative cooling, the molecules are formed by three-body recombination near a Feshbach resonance and finally condense in a long-lived thermal equilibrium state. We measured the characteristic frequency of a collective excitation mode and demonstrated the magnetic field{\textendash}dependent mean field by controlled condensate spilling.},
