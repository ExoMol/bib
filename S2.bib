	It is observed that atoms separated by nearest neighbor distance
	of the lattice do immediately recombine even at 1 K with no thermal
	activation. While separated by one lattice constant, the S atoms
	stay stable up to 80 K and no recombination is observed in the classical
	trajectories. Consequently, the simulation was able to reproduce
	the experimental S+S glow curve only by lowering the reaction barrier
	by introducing lattice vacancies in the four atom plane separating
	the S-S pair. Local 1.1 eV kinetic excitation of a lattice atom next
	to the trapped S-S pair or artificial shock waves initiated by more
	distant excitation at 2 eV or more greatly enhanced the probability

	and 210.91cm(1) between the B2 and B1 state, which agree well with
	the corresponding measurements of 383, 77.51 and 209cm(1), respectively.
	Moreover, other spectroscopic parameters are also in excellent agreement
	with the measurements. It demonstrates that the spectroscopic parameters
	of 24 states reported here for the first time can be expected to
	be reliable predicted ones.},
