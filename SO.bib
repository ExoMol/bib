	atomization energies come from the series of basis sets that yield
	the most consistent results for all extrapolation techniques. In

	3 appear to suggest that the extrapolation may not be reliable. It
	does not appear possible to determine a reliable basis set series
	using only the triple and quadruple-zeta based sets. The scalar relativistic
	effects reduce the atomization of SO and SO(2) by 0.34 and 0.81 kcal/mol,
	respectively, and clearly must be accounted for if a highly accurate
	atomization energy is to be computed. The magnitude of the core-valence
	(CV) contribution to the atomization is affected by missing diffuse
	valence functions. The CV contribution is much more stable if basis
	set superposition errors are accounted for. A similar study of SF,

	by the SOIR spectrometer at the altitudes of 65-80 km in the IR and

	39 sessions of solar occultation, where boresights of both spectrometers

	Plateau de Bure interferometer of Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique
	(IRAM). Aims. The observations provide informations on the spatial
	and velocity distributions of these molecules. They can be used to
	constrain their photodissociation rate and their origin in the coma,
	i.e. nucleus or parent source. Methods. We use a radiative transfer
	code which allows us to compute synthetic line profiles and interferometric
	maps, to be compared to the observations. Results. Both single-dish
	spectra and interferometric spectral maps show evidence for a day/night
	asymmetry in the outgassing. From the analysis of the spectral maps,
	including the astrometry, we show that SO and CS present in addition
	a jet-like structure that may be the gaseous counterpart of the dust
	high-latitude jet observed in optical images. A CS rotating jet is
	also observed. Using the astrometry provided by continuum radio maps
	obtained in parallel at IRAM, we conclude that there is no need to
	invoke the existence of nongravitational forces acting on this comet,
	and provide an updated orbit. The radial extension of H2S is found
	to be consistent with direct release of H2S from the nucleus. SO
	displays an extended radial distribution. Assuming that SO2 is the
	parent of SO, the photodissociation rate of SO is measured to be
	1.5 x 10(-4) s(-1) at 1 AU from the Sun. This is lower than most
	laboratory-based estimates and may suggest that SO is not solely
	produced by SO2 photolysis. From the observations of J(2-1) and J(5-4)
	CS lines, we deduce a CS photodissociation rate of 1-5 x 10(-5) s(-1).
	The photodissociation rate of CS2, the likely parent of CS, cannot
	be constrained due to insuffcient angular resolution, but our data
	are consistent with published values. Conclusions. These observations
	illustrate the cometary science that will be performed with the future
	ALMA interferometer.},

  abstract = {The globule CB 34, which harbours a cluster of class 0 young stellar
	object (YSO) protostars, has been investigated through a multiline
	SO and SiO survey at millimetre wavelengths. The SO data reveal that
	the globule consists of three quiescent high-density (similar to10(5)
	cm(-3)) clumps, labelled A, B and C, with sizes of similar to0.2-0.3
	pc. The SiO data provide evidence for high-velocity gas across the
	globule. Most likely, the high-velocity gas is distributed in three
	distinct high-velocity outflows associated with the YSOs in each
	of the three clumps. High-velocity SO features have been detected
	only towards the two brightest SiO outflows. These broad SO components
	exhibit spatial and spectral distributions which are consistent with
	those of the SiO emission, so they can also be used as tracers of
	the outflows. The comparison between the spatial and spectral properties
	of the SO and SiO emissions in the three clumps suggests different
	evolutionary stages for the embedded YSOs. In particular, the YSO
	associated with clump C exhibits some peculiarities, namely smaller
	SiO linewidths, lower SiO column densities, a lack of extended SiO
	structure and of SO wings, and the presence of a SO spatial distribution
	which is displaced with respect to the location of the YSO. This
	behaviour is well explained if the SiO and SO molecules which were
	produced at high velocities in the shocked region have been destroyed
	or slowed down because of the interaction with the ambient medium,
	and the chemistry is dominated again by low-temperature reactions.
	Thus our observations strongly suggest that the YSO in clump C is
	in a more evolved phase than the other members of the cluster.},

	N(SO)= 5 10(12) cm(-2). Based on the visual extinction estimates
	we derive abundances X(SO)=2 10(-9), thus again higher than can be
	predicted by chemical models with standard assumptions on a low initial
	S abundance in the gas phase. Our new observations therefore confirm
	our previous conclusion, that in cirrus clouds sulphur must be essentially
	undepleted to explain the amount of SO detected. For MCLD 126.6+24.5
	we present an analysis of our extensive SO (N-J = 1(0) --> 0(1))
	mapping. The SO emission reveals clumpy structure of that cloud.
	We decompose the SO cloud into 17 individual clumps. Those clumps
	follow the same size-line width relation as high latitude molecular
	clouds (HLCs) on larger scales. Also, the size-density relation for
	the SO clouds has the same slope as that for other HLCs found from

	ratio of CS and SO ranges from unity for MCLD 126.6+24.5 to less
	than 0.1 for the other clouds, indicating a low depletion of oxygen
	in that clouds. Our detailed comparison of CS and SO in MCLD 126.6+24.5
	both in position and in velocity indicate that the molecules do not
	necessarily coexist in the cloud; we find that both molecules are
	not equally distributed, that the profiles of both molecules look
	different and that there is no correlation between the column densities
	of the molecules. Our findings let us suggest that these clouds are
	inhomogeneous clumpy objects, possibly not well described by simple

	NIRSPEC on the W.M. Keck II telescope. The integrated emitted intensity
	for this band varies from 0.8 x 10(27) to 2.4 x 10(27) photons/s,
	with a possible link to variations in Loki's infrared brightness.
	The band-shapes imply rotational temperatures of 550-1000 K for the
	emitting gas, lending further evidence to a volcanic origin for sulfur
	monoxide. An attempt to detect the B-1 Sigma -> X-3 Sigma(-) - transition
	of SO at 0.97 mu m. was unsuccessful; Simultaneous detection with
	the 1.707 mu m band would permit determination of the SO column abundance.

	reveals that while all molecules are to zeroth order correlated,
	that is, that they are all found in dense molecular clouds, there
	are three distinct groups of molecules distinguished by the location
	of their emission within the nuclear region. N(2)H(+), C(18)O, HNC,

	are then still unclear. This paper presents disk-resolved observations
	performed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 345 GHz of atmospheric
	rotational lines of the main atmospheric species SO2, and, for the
	first time, of the minor species SO and NaCl All these species appear

	are compared to realistic models simulating gas sources including
	volcanic plume outgassing, SO2 frost sublimation and photolysis.
	Arguments in favor of each sources are examined and compared to observations,
	putting constraints on their relative roles for each species. While
	sublimation clearly appears as the favored major source for SO2,
	SO2 photolysis may account for most of the production of SO. Using
	constraints on the volcanic plumes distribution from Galileo results,

	for 19 molecular clouds, together with tables of relevant ratios
	at strategic positions, where we have also observed (SO)-S-34 and/or
	(CS)-S-34. The SO/CS abundance ratio as calculated from an LTE analysis
	is highly varying within and between the sources. Our isotopomer
	observations and Monte Carlo simulations verify that this is not
	an artifact due to optical depth problems. The variation of the maximum
	SO/CS abundance ratio between the clouds is 0.2-7. The largest variations
	within a cloud are found for the most nearby objects, possibly indicating
	resolution effects. We have also performed time dependent chemical
	simulations. We compare the simulations with our observed SO/CS abundance
	ratios and suggest a varying oxygen to carbon initial abundance,
	differing temporal evolution, density differences and X-ray sources
	associated with young stellar objects as possible explanations to
	the variations. In particular, the observed variation of the maximum
	SO/CS abundance ratio between the clouds can be explained by using
	initial O/C+ abundance ratios in the range 1.3-2.5. We finally derive
	a relationship between the SO/CS and O-2/CO abundance ratios, which
	may be used as a guide to find the most promising interstellar O-2
	search targets.},

	of SO, previously thought to be mostly repulsive, does in fact have
	a relatively deep potential. As a result of an avoided crossing around
	3.9 a(0), this state does have, for large internuclear distances,
	the repulsive nature experimentalists have agreed upon, and which
	has somehow been incorrectly extended to shorter distances; its supposed
	repulsive nature may have discouraged theoreticians from exploring
	excited states other than A (3) Pi, B-3 Sigma(-), and (3) Delta.
	As a consequence of the findings of this work, all existing experimental
	data on the excited states of B (3) Sigma(-) and part of A(3) Pi
	will necessarily have to be reanalysed to properly take into account
	the perturbations caused by these new 3 Pi states and other lower
	lying (3) Sigma(+) and 3 Delta states on the spectra of SO. The theoretical
	predictions of this work were based on a state averaged complete
	active space self-consistent/internally contracted multireference
	configuration interaction (CASSCF/CMRCI) calculation using averaged
	natural orbitals expanded in terms of the cc-pVQZ set of atomic functions.
	The following spectroscopic constants characterizing these new states

	R-max = 3.914 a(0), E-max=0.64eV for what we now call the C-3 Pi;
	and R-e=3.883 a(0), T-e=6.15 eV, Delta G(nu+1/2) = 817, 752, 641

	cm(-1), omega(e)y(e) = -7.702 cm(-1), R-max = 4.394 a(0), E-max =
	0.42 eV, for what we now call the C'(3) Pi state. The very anharmonic

	Diurnal behavior is evident, with more SO2, and less SO, at night

	measured SO2 and SO abundances each changing by up to 2x Or more

	rapid as a 5 sigma doubling of SO on a one-week timescale is seen.
	The sum of SO2 and SO abundances varies by an order of magnitude

	be present, and that it must function as both a sink and source for
	these molecules. The ratio SO2/SO varies by nearly two orders of

	distributions are temporally invariant, with far more SO2 and SO

	ratio with altitude requires that the primary SO2 source be upper
	mesospheric photochemistry, contrary to atmospheric models which

	of upper mesospheric aerosol, with assumption that it is composed

  abstract = {We have investigated the kinetics of excitation and lasing of the
	free radical SO by rotationally-resolved optical pumping near 250
	nm with a continuously-tunable, narrow-line width KrF laser. Longitudinal
	photodissociation of SO2 by a 193-nm ArF excimer laser produced SO(X(3)
	Sigma(-)) concentrations close to 10(16) cm(-3) over a 50-cm length.
	Pumping of SO(B-3 Sigma(-)) by the KrF laser occurred from the v''=2
	ground state cm vibrational level which was preferentially produced
	by photodissociation. The fraction of ground state population that
	could be excited to SO(B) was determined by measuring the saturation
	fluence for excitation as a function of buffer gas pressure and comparing
	with a simple model. Addition of a buffer gas increased excitation
	by nearly 30 times due to increased rotational mixing in the ground
	electronic state. Lasing was demonstrated on six new vibrational
	bands of fully-allowed SO(B-X) band in the region 262-315 nm. A small-signal
	gain coefficient of 0.11 cm(-1) and pulse energy of 11 mu J were
	achieved on the 270-nm SO-(B,v'=2-->X,v''=5) laser transition. A
	full computational rate equation model of the excitation and lasing
	dynamics, including collisional rotational mixing, was developed.
	The A(3) Pi electronic state of SO was also investigated as a possible
	ultraviolet energy storage laser medium. Excitation of SO(A(3) Pi,v'=5,6)
	near 250 nm was achieved after a time delay from photodissociation
	to allow for vibrational relaxation into SO(X,v''=0). Measurements
	of the radiative lifetime, deactivation rate, and saturation fluence,
	along with computation modeling, indicate that a storage laser based
	on the weak SO(A,v'=0-->X,v''=4) transition is not feasible with
	our production and excitation capabilities. Lasing on a direct-pumped
	single rotational transition of the SO(A,v'=5-->X,v''=1) band may
	be possible, but with very limited capacity to store energy.},

  abstract = {The potential energy curves of the 69 Omega states generated from
	the 24 Lambda S states of sulfur monoxide are calculated for the
	first time using the internally contracted multireference configuration
	interaction method with the Davidson correction and the entirely
	uncontracted aug-cc-pV5Z basis set. Spin-orbit coupling is taken
	into account by the state interaction approach with the full Breit-Pauli
	Hamiltonian. Very good agreement is achieved between our computed
	spectroscopic properties and the available experimental data. The
	transition properties of the B-3 Sigma(-) -X-3 Sigma(-) and (4)1-X0(+)
	transitions are predicted, and our computed Franck-Condon factors
	and radiative lifetimes match the experimental results very well.
	The predissociation mechanisms are investigated, and various new
	predissociation channels are located. We present a new interpretation
	on the breaking-off of the rotational levels of the B-3 Sigma(-)
	lower vibrational states observed in experiment, and propose that
	the predissociation is induced by the Coriolis coupling between the
	B-3 Sigma(-) rovibrational levels and the A(3)Pi state. Our calculations
	indicate that, at nu' = 9, the B-3 Sigma(-) state predissociates
	via the C-3 Pi state; around nu' = 14, three spin-orbit-induced predissociation
	pathways via (1)(5)Sigma(+), (2)(5)Pi, and e(1)Pi would be open;
	around nu' = 17, the pathways via (2)(1)Sigma(+), (2)(3)Sigma(+)
	and (2)(5)Sigma(+) would contribute. These satisfactorily explain
	the experimental results about the diffuseness of the B-3 Sigma(-)
	bands. Furthermore, various predissociation pathways of the C'(3)
	P state are predicted, through which the C'(3)Pi state could predissociate
	rapidly. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 32: 1577-1588,
