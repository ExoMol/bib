Abstract = {Laser excitation of isotopically labeled SO2 molecules in a neon matrix

   tilde-(X) over tilde transition lies at 25 747 cm(-1) in
   (OSO)-O-16-O-16, shifted 18 cm(-1) to the red from the gas phase; the
   three vibrational frequencies of the (X) over tilde state are nearly
   unperturbed in the neon matrix (1149, 520, and 1362 cm(-1)). As the
   zero-phonon lines are sharp and well resolved, it has been possible to
   monitor emission from a specific isotopomer to obtain its excitation
   spectrum. The excitation spectra of matrix-isolated (OSO)-O-16-O-16 and
   (OSO)-O-18-O-18 in the region 350.9-388.5 nm (25 740-28 500 cm(-1)) are
   similar to those previously observed in the gas phase, with strong
   perturbations affecting all vibrational levels above a(3)B(1)(110) at 27
   005 cm(-1) (370 nm). Two additional groups of bands are observed for the
   unsymmetrical isotopomer (OSO)-O-18-O-16; they are identified as
   transitions to levels of the (a) over tilde(3)B(1) state with v(3) = 1
   and as direct transitions to the (b) over tilde(3)A(2) state, which both
   become allowed in the lower symmetry. The v(3) frequency of the (a) over
   tilde(3)B(1) state of (OSO)-O-18-O-16 is 922 cm(-1); for the (b) over
   tilde(3)A(2) state, v(1) similar or equal to 791 cm(-1) and v(2) similar
   or equal to 315 cm(-1), while the (b) over tilde (001) level lies 26 653
   cm(-1) above the (X) over tilde (000) level.},

   the most suitable range of the spectrum for passive sensing of hot SO2

   patterns are much simpler and more self-consistent than those of the
   main isotopologue 626. The discrepancies are mainly found for higher
   K-a/J transitions. 626 and 646 exhibit comparable line position and
   intensity agreement for lower ICall transitions. The line position
   deviations for the 636 purely rotational band are parallel to those of
   626 and 646, while its line intensity deviations do not show branching
   patterns as we found in the 626 and 646 cases. Predictions for the other
   minor isotopologues are expected to exhibit similar accuracy. These line
   lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives for missing bands of
   626 and the minor isotopologues. It may significantly facilitate the
   laboratory spectroscopic measurement and analysis, as well as to
   identify these isotopologues in various astrophysical environments.},

   isotope systems and serve as important tracers of past and present
   atmospheric processes. These unique isotope signatures signify the
   breakdown of the traditional theory of isotope fractionation, but the
   physical chemistry of these isotope effects remains poorly understood.
   We report the production of large sulfur isotope MIF, with Delta S-33 up
   to 78\% and Delta S-36 up to 110\%, from the broadband excitation of SO2
   in the 250-350-nm absorption region. Acetylene is used to selectively
   trap the triplet-state SO2 ((a) over tilde B-3(1)), which results from
   intersystem crossing from the excited singlet ((A) over tilde
   (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) states. The observed MIF signature
   differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific
   absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength
   region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF
   originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states
   but from an isotope selective spin-orbit interaction between the singlet
   ((A) over tilde (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) and triplet ((a) over
   tilde B-3(1)) manifolds. Calculations based on high-level potential
   energy surfaces of the multiple excited states show a considerable
   lifetime anomaly for (SO2)-S-33 and (SO2)-S-36 for the low vibrational
   levels of the (A) over tilde (1)A(2) state. These results demonstrate
   that the isotope selectivity of accidental near-resonance interactions
   between states is of critical importance in understanding the origin of
   MIF in photochemical systems.},

The band is seen in absorption in UX Cyg, while it is in emission in o Cet.
Seven spectra of T Cep taken at different phases show that the feature changes
from emission to absorption on a time scale of twice the pulsation period. Using
an LTE model, we find that the excitation temperature of SO_2 is typically 600 K,
and that in T Cep the molecule occupies a region with dimensions of several stellar
radii. The total number of molecules contained in this region is of order 10(47),
which requires a local gas density of at least 10(9) H_2 cm(-3) , and possibly up
to 10(11) H_2 cm(-3) depending on the SO_2 abundance. The variation with phase of
the T Cep spectra can be explained by photodissociation of SO_2 molecules by soft UV photons.

   of the planet of 1.1 ppb, 0.7 ppb and 1.3 ppb for SO2, SO and H2S,
   respectively. Our derived upper limit for SO2 is comparable to
   previously reported limits, whereas for H2S we set a more stringent
   upper limit than previously measured, and we establish a limit for SO.
   Among the targeted molecules, SO2 is the strongest indicator for
   volcanic outgassing. Assuming a photochemical lifetime of 2 years for
   SO2, our upper limit of 1.1 ppb implies an outgassing rate less than 55
   metric tons/day. This rate limits the daily amount of degassing magma to
   less than 12,000 m(3). Our sensitivity is sufficient to detect a
   volcanic release on Mars that is 4\% the SO2 released continuously from
   Kilauea volcano in Hawaii or 5\% that of the Masaya volcano in

first analysis of the sulfur chemistry of an extragalactic source, the nuclear
region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. This is the first time that H2S and,
tentatively, H2CS are detected toward the nucleus of a starburst galaxy.
Source-averaged fractional abundances of these molecules are a few times 10-9,
except for CS and OCS, which are more abundant (10-8). Sulfur isotopic ratios,
32S/34S ~ 8 ± 2 and 34S/33S > 9, are measured through observations of 13CS,
C34S, and C33S. A comparison with the observed relative abundances toward different
prototypical Galactic sources suggests that the chemical composition of NGC 253
is similar to that found toward molecular cloud complexes like Sgr B2 in the
nuclear region of the Milky Way. The large overabundance of OCS compared with
the predictions of time-dependent sulfur chemistry models supports the idea that
OCS is likely to have been injected into the gas phase from grain mantles by
low-velocity shocks.},

Volume = {103},
Pages = {12274},
Abstract = {Mass loss from evolved stars results in the formation of unusual
chemical laboratories: circumstellar envelopes. Such envelopes are found around
carbon- and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants.
As the gaseous material of the envelope flows from the star, the resulting
temperature and density gradients create a complex chemical environment involving
hot, thermodynamically controlled synthesis, molecule “freeze-out,” shock-initiated
reactions, and photochemistry governed by radical mechanisms. In the circumstellar
envelope of the carbon-rich star IRC+10216, >50 different chemical compounds have
been identified, including such exotic species as C8H, C3S, SiC3, and AlNC.
The chemistry here is dominated by molecules containing long carbon chains,
silicon, and metals such as magnesium, sodium, and aluminum, which makes it quite
distinct from that found in molecular clouds. The molecular composition of the
oxygen-rich counterparts is not nearly as well explored, although recent studies
of VY Canis Majoris have resulted in the identification of HCO+, SO2, and even
NaCl in this object, suggesting chemical complexity here as well. As these
envelopes evolve into planetary nebulae with a hot, exposed central star,
synthesis of molecular ions becomes important, as indicated by studies of
NGC 7027. Numerous species such as HCO+, HCN, and CCH are found in old planetary
nebulae such as the Helix. This “survivor” molecular material may be linked to
the variety of compounds found recently in diffuse clouds. Organic molecules
in dense interstellar clouds may ultimately be traced back to carbon-rich
fragments originally formed in circumstellar shells.},

Volume = {210},
Pages = {784-786},
Abstract = {Twenty spectra of Io (0.26 to 0.33 micrometer), acquired with the
International Ultraviolet Explorer spacecraft, have been studied. There is a strong
ultraviolet absorption shortward of 0.33 micrometer that is consistent with earlier
ground-based spectrophotometry; its strength is strongly dependent on Io's rotational
phase angle at the time of observation. This spectral feature and its variation are
interpreted as indicative of a longitudinal variation in the distribution of sulfur
dioxide frost on Io. The frost is most abundant at orbital longitudes 72° to 137°
and least abundant at longitudes 250° to 323°. Variations in spectral reflectivity
between 0.4 and 0.5 micrometer, reported in earlier ground-based spectral studies,
correlate inversely with variations in reflectivity between 0.26 and 0.33 micrometer.
It is concluded that this is because the Io surface component with the highest visible
reflectivity (sulfur dioxide frost) has the lowest ultraviolet reflectivity. At least
one other component is present and may be sulfur allotropes or alkali sulfides.
This model is consistent with ground-based ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrophotometry.
Comparison with Voyager color photographs indicates that the sulfur dioxide frost is in
greatest concentration in the "white" areas on Io and the other sulfurous components
are in greatest concentration in the "red" areas.},

Abstract = {We report the first detections of SO 2, NS and NO in an extragalactic
source, the nucleus of the starburst galaxy  NGC 253 . Five SO 2 transitions, three
groups of hyperfine components of NO and five of NS were detected. All three species
show large abundances averaged over the inner 200 pc of NGC 253 . With a relative
abundance of a few 10-7, the emission of the NO molecule is similar or even larger
than that found in Galactic star forming regions. The derived relative molecular
abundances for each molecule have been compared with those of prototypical Galactic
molecular clouds. These results seem to confirm that large scale shocks dominate
the chemistry of these molecules in the nucleus of NGC 253 , ruling out a chemistry
dominated by PDRs for the bulk of the gas.},

Title = {{Sulfur chemistry in the envelopes of massive young stars}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2003},
Volume = {412},
Pages = {133},
Abstract = {The sulphur chemistry in nine regions in the earliest stages of
high-mass star formation is studied through single-dish submillimeter spectroscopy.
The line profiles indicate that 10-50% of the SO and SO 2 emission arises in
high-velocity gas, either infalling or outflowing. For the low-velocity gas,
excitation temperatures are 25 K for H 2S, 50 K for SO, H 2CS, NS and HCS +,
and 100 K for OCS and SO 2, indicating that most observed emission traces the
outer parts ( T<100 K) of the molecular envelopes, except high-excitation OCS
and SO 2 lines. Abundances in the outer envelopes, calculated with a Monte
Carlo program, using the physical structures of the sources derived from
previous submillimeter continuum and CS line data, are ~10 -8 for OCS, ~10 -9
for H 2S, H 2CS, SO and SO 2, and ~10 -10 for HCS + and NS. In the inner
envelopes ( T>100 K) of six sources, the SO 2 abundance is enhanced by a
factor of ~100-1000. This region of hot, abundant SO 2 has been seen before
in infrared absorption, and must be small, $\la$0 $\farcs$2 (180 AU radius).
The derived abundance profiles are consistent with models of envelope chemistry
which invoke ice evaporation at $T\sim 100$  K. Shock chemistry is unlikely to
contribute. A major sulphur carrier in the ices is probably OCS, not H 2S as
most models assume. The source-to-source abundance variations of most molecules
by factors of ~10 do not correlate with previous systematic tracers of envelope
heating. Without observations of H 2S and SO lines probing warm ( $\ga$100 K)
gas, sulphur-bearing molecules cannot be used as evolutionary tracers during
star formation.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {648},
Pages = {1181},
Abstract = {Thermochemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations are used to model
sulfur and phosphorus chemistry in giant planets, brown dwarfs, and extrasolar giant
planets (EGPs). The chemical behavior of individual S- and P-bearing gases and
condensates is determined as a function of pressure, temperature, and metallicity.
The results are independent of particular model atmospheres, and in principle,
the equilibrium composition along the pressure-temperature profile of any object
can be determined. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the dominant S-bearing gas throughout
substellar atmospheres and approximately represents the atmospheric sulfur inventory.
Silicon sulfide (SiS) is a potential tracer of weather in substellar atmospheres.
Disequilibrium abundances of phosphine (PH3) approximately representative of the
total atmospheric phosphorus inventory are expected to be mixed upward into the
observable atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. In hotter objects, several
P-bearing gases (e.g., P2, PH3, PH 2, PH, and HCP) become increasingly important
at high temperatures.},

Abstract = {With the Caltech Submillimeter Telescope, we have performed an unbiased

lines down to a threshold of 1-2 K in main beam brightness temperature units, and
we found 1064 spectral features consisting of 2032 lines, partially blended.
Apart from the abundant diatomic rotors such as CO, CS, SO, the spectrum is dominated
by CH3OH and SO2, both in terms of numbers of lines and integrated flux. The number
of unidentified lines is 155 or 14%. We also report the tentative identification
of the new molecule SiH in our data. For some complex organic molecules, we find
rotation temperatures and column densities which are much higher than those found
in earlier studies. It is likely the cause of this is a significant contribution
from a very compact, hot component of the Orion molecular cloud core which was not
visible in lower frequency surveys.},

Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope in March 1992 have resulted in the first

be Io's primary atmospheric constituent. Below ∼2130 Å the geometric albedo of the

using models that include the effects of optical thickness, temperature, and spatial
distribution. The disk-integrated HST data cannot resolve the spatial distribution,
but it is possible to define basic properties and set constraints on the atmosphere
at the time of the observations, Hemispheric atmospheres with average column density
N = 6-10 × 1015 cm-2 and Tgas = 110-500 K fit the data, with preference for temperatures
of ∼200-250 K. Better fits are found as the atmosphere is spatially confined, with a
limit of ∼8% hemispheric areal coverage and N ≈ 3 × 1017 cm-2 with colder 110-250 K
temperatures. A dense (N ≥1016 cm-2), localized component of SO2 gas, such ns that
possibly associated with active volcanoes, can generate the observed spectral contrast
only when the atmosphere is cold (110 K) and an extended component such as Pele is
included. The combination of a dense, localized atmosphere with a tenuous
component (N < 1016 cm-2 either patchy or extended) also fits the data. In all

Oulu (Finland) with different pressures, absorption path lengths, and recording time.
That allowed us to record not only the ν1ν1 and ν3ν3 bands with higher values of

time very weak 2ν22ν2 band. In this case, transitions with the values View the

became clear in the course of the analysis, the rotational parameters of the ground
vibrational state, known in the literature, do not describe suitably the ground
state combination differences (GSCD) for the states with the value Ka>26–27Ka>26–27.
As a consequence, the ground state rotational parameters were improved on the basis
of our experimental data. The 12 131 transitions assigned in the experimental
spectrum (7618, 3952, and 561 transitions of the bands ν1ν1, ν3ν3, and 2ν22ν2,
respectively) were used for determination of ro-vibrational energy values of the
vibrational states (100), (001), and (020). The lasts were used then in the fit
procedure together with known in the literature high accurate sub-millimeter wave data.
Resonance interactions between all three vibrational states have been taken into
account in the Hamiltonian used for the fit. As a result, the 51 varied parameters,
obtained from the fit, reproduce 4063 ro-vibrational energies of the states (100), (001),
and (020) (12 131 initial experimental transitions) with accuracies close to experimental
uncertainties: the rms deviation is 6.1×10−5 cm−1, 9.7×10−5 cm−1, and 13.9×10−5 cm−1 for
our FTIR data (for the (100), (001), and (020) states, respectively), and comparable

Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {283-304},
Abstract = {We have observed about 16 absorption lines of the ν2ν2 SO2 vibrational band on
Io, in disk-integrated 19-μm spectra taken with the TEXES high spectral resolution
mid-infrared spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in November 2001,
December 2002, and January 2004. These are the first ground-based infrared observations
of Io's sunlit atmosphere, and provide a new window on the atmosphere that allows
better longitudinal and temporal monitoring than previous techniques. Dramatic
variations in band strength with longitude are seen that are stable over at least
a 2 year period. The depth of the strongest feature, a blend of lines centered
at 530.42 cm−1, varies from about 7% near longitude 180° to about 1% near longitude
315° W, as measured at a spectral resolution of 57,000. Interpretation of the
spectra requires modeling of surface temperatures and atmospheric density across
Io's disk, and the variation in non-LTE ν2ν2 vibrational temperature with altitude,
and depends on the assumed atmospheric and surface temperature structure. About
half of Io's 19-μm radiation comes from the Sun-heated surface, and half from
volcanic hot spots with temperatures primarily between 150 and 200 K, which occupy
about 8% of the surface. The observations are thus weighted towards the atmosphere
over these low-temperature hot spots. If we assume that the atmosphere over the
hot spots is representative of the atmosphere elsewhere, and that the atmospheric
density is a function of latitude, the most plausible interpretation of the data
is that the equatorial atmospheric column density varies from
about 1.5×1017 cm−21.5×1017 cm−2 near longitude 180° W to about 1.5×1016 cm−21.5×1016 cm−2 near longitude 300° W,
roughly consistent with HST UV spectroscopy and Lyman-α imaging. The inferred
atmospheric kinetic temperature is less than about 150 K, at least on the anti-Jupiter
hemisphere where the bands are strongest, somewhat colder than inferred from HST UV
spectroscopy and millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy. This longitudinal variability
in atmospheric density correlates with the longitudinal variability in the abundance
of optically thick, near-UV bright SO2 frost. However it is not clear whether the
correlation results from volcanic control (regions of large frost abundance result
from greater condensation of atmospheric gases supported by more vigorous volcanic
activity in these regions) or sublimation control (regions of large frost abundance
produce a more extensive atmosphere due to more extensive sublimation). Comparison
of data taken in 2001, 2002, and 2004 shows that with the possible exception of
longitudes near 180° W between 2001 and 2002, Io's atmospheric density does not
appear to decrease as Io recedes from the Sun, as would be expected if the atmosphere
were supported by the sublimation of surface frost, suggesting that the atmosphere
is dominantly supported by direct volcanic supply rather than by frost sublimation.
However, other evidence such as the smooth variation in atmospheric abundance with
latitude, and atmospheric changes during eclipse, suggest that sublimation support
is more important than volcanic support, leaving the question of the dominant atmospheric
support mechanism still unresolved.},

essential for obtaining reliable molecular geometries. The differential effect
of core correlation on computed properties is in fact much less important.
The CCSD(T) one-particle basis set limit for the symmetric stretching frequencies
appears to be higher than the exact value, while the antisymmetric stretching
frequency benefits from an error cancellation. The basis set extension effects
of diffuse functions and inner polarization functions appear to be nearly
perfectly additive. Our best computed atomization energies and geometries agree
to within 0.1 kcal/mol, 0.0004 Angstrom, and 0.03 degrees with experiment:

wavefunctions can be constructed directly from the algebraic fit to the experimental

is interpreted as a transition from normal-mode to local-mode behavior on the basis

Abstract = {The ultraviolet absorption cross sections of the SO2 isotopologues are
   essential to understanding the photochemical fractionation of sulfur
   isotopes in planetary atmospheres. We present measurements of the
   absorption cross sections of (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, (SO2)-S-34, and
   (SO2)-S-36, recorded from 190 to 220nm at room temperature with a
   resolution of 0.1nm (25cm(-1)) made using a dual-beam photospectrometer.
   The measured absorption cross sections show an apparent pressure
   dependence and a newly developed analytical model shows that this is
   caused by underresolved fine structure. The model made possible the
   calculation of absorption cross sections at the zero-pressure limit that
   can be used to calculate photolysis rates for atmospheric scenarios. The
   (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, and (SO2)-S-34 cross sections improve upon
   previously published spectra including fine structure and peak widths.
   This is the first report of absolute absorption cross sections of the
   (SO2)-S-36 isotopologue for the (CB2)-B-1-X(1)A(2) band where the
   amplitude of the vibrational structure is smaller than the other
   isotopologues throughout the spectrum. Based on the new results, solar
   UV photodissociation of SO2 produces (34)epsilon, (33), and (36)
   isotopic fractionations of +4.611.6, +8.89.0, and -8.8 +/- 19.6 parts
   per thousand, respectively. From these spectra isotopic effects during
   photolysis in the Archean atmosphere can be calculated and compared to
   the Archean sedimentary record. Our results suggest that broadband solar
   UV photolysis is capable of producing the mass-independent fractionation
   observed in the Archean sedimentary record without involving shielding
   by specific gaseous compounds in the atmosphere including SO2 itself.
   The estimated magnitude of (33), for example, is close to the maximum

Abstract = {We report measurements of the ultraviolet absorption cross-sections of
   (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, (SO2)-S-34 and (SO2)-S-36 recorded from 250 to
   320 nm at 293 K with a resolution of 8 cm(-1). This is the first
   reported measurement of the (SO2)-S-36 cross-section. This work improves
   earlier measurements of the (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33 and (SO2)-S-34
   cross-sections and is in good agreement concerning fine structure and
   peak widths, with localized differences at the peak maxima when isotope
   effects are taken into account. SO2 samples were produced in an
   identical process via combustion of isotopically enriched S-0,
   eliminating effects due to variation in oxygen isotopic composition.
   Peak positions for the rare isotopologues are red shifted relative to
   the (SO2)-S-32 isotopologue. Starting at the origin the shift increases
   linearly through the band. A linear shift model based on the spectrum of
   (SO2)-S-32 was used to estimate the cross-sections of (SO2)-S-33,34,36;
   the average of the wavelength resolved absolute difference between the
   modeled and experimental spectra is 77.4, 107 and 139 parts per thousand
   respectively. While the peak-to-valley amplitude of (SO2)-S-36 tends to
   be smaller than the other isotopologues throughout the spectrum,
   integrated band intensities for all isotopologues are conserved to
   within 4\% relative to (SO2)-S-32. The cross-sections were used in a
   photochemical model to obtain fractionation constants to compare with
   photochemical chamber experiments. We conclude that planetary
   atmospheres will exhibit isotopic fractionation from both
   photoexcitation and photodissociation, and that experiments in the
   literature have isotopic imprints arising from both the
   (BB1)-B-1-X(1)A(1) and the (CB1)-B-1-X(1)A(1) bands. Citation:

Abstract = {The C approximate to B-1(2)-X approximate to (1)A(1) photoexcitation of

   technique based on the three-dimensional potential energy surfaces of
   the X approximate to and C approximate to states, which were calculated
   using the ab initio molecular orbital configuration interaction method.
   Numerous wave packet simulations were carried out under the adiabatic
   approximation and used to calculate the sigma's of the seven
   isotopologues at 298 K; we concluded that the absorption spectrum of SO2
   can be reliably modeled within the adiabatic framework based on the
   analysis of the time evolution of the wave packet. The calculated
   sigma's are in reasonable agreement with the recent experiment in the
   190-228 nm region, and the isotope shifts of the peaks for S-33 O-16(2)
   and S-34 O-16(2) relative to the corresponding peaks for S-32 O-16(2)
   are in good agreement with the observed data. Relative to the sigma of
   S-32 O-16(2), isotopic substitution shows a significant increment for
   those of S-34 O-16(2) and S-36 O-16(2) in the 190-228 nm region. This

   investigated and are favorably compared to existing studies in the

   inaccurate wavelength scale definition. Moreover, literature data are
   often given only on restricted spectral intervals. Combined with the

Abstract = {We present daily measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from
active volcanoes in Ecuador and southern Colombia between September 2004 and
September 2006, derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's EOS/Aura
satellite. OMI is an ultraviolet/visible spectrometer with an unprecedented combination
of spatial and spectral resolution, and global coverage, that permits daily measurements
of passive volcanic degassing from space. We use non-interactive processing methods
to automatically extract daily SO2 burdens and information on SO2 sources from the
OMI datastream. Maps of monthly average SO2 vertical columns retrieved by OMI over
Ecuador and S. Colombia are also used to illustrate variations in regional SO2
loading and to pinpoint sources. The dense concentration of active volcanoes in
Ecuador provides a stringent test of OMI's ability to distinguish SO2 from multiple
emitting sources. Our analysis reveals that Tungurahua, Reventador and Galeras
were responsible for the bulk of the SO2 emissions in the region in the timeframe
of our study, with no significant SO2 discharge detected from Sangay. At Galeras
and Reventador, we conclude that OMI can detect variations in SO2 release related
to cycles of conduit sealing and degassing, which are a critical factor in hazard
assessment. The OMI SO2 data for Reventador are the most extensive sequence of
degassing measurements available for this remote volcano, which dominated regional
SO2 production in June–August 2005. At Tungurahua, the OMI measurements span the
waning stage of one eruptive cycle and the beginning of another, and we observe
increasing SO2 burdens in the months prior to explosive eruptions of the volcano
in July and August 2006. Cumulative SO2 loadings measured by OMI yield a total
of ~ 1.16 Tg SO2 emitted by volcanoes on mainland Ecuador/S. Colombia between

Pages = {1377-1379},
Abstract = {The eruptions of El Chichón volcano on 28 March and 3 and 4 April 1982
were observed by the Nimbus 7 total ozone mapping spectrometer due to strong
absorption by volcanic gases at the shortest wavelengths of the spectrometer (312.5
and 317.5 nanometers). These ultraviolet pictures permit a measurement of the volume,
dispersion, and drift of volcanic gas clouds. The tropospheric clouds were rapidly
dispersed in westerly winds while persistent stratospheric clouds drifted in easterly
winds at speeds up to 13 meters per second. The spectral reflectance is consistent
with sulfur dioxide absorption and rules out carbon disulfide as a major constituent.
A preliminary estimate of the mass of sulfur dioxide deposited in the stratosphere
by the large eruptions on 3 and 4 April is 3.3 x 106 tons. Prior estimates of
volcanic cloud volume were based on extrapolation of locally measured sulfur dioxide
concentrations.},

Abstract = {The total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS), first flown on the
Nimbus 7 satellite, has delivered an unanticipated set of unique information
about volcanic plumes because of its contiguous spatial mapping and use of UV
wavelengths. The accuracies of TOMS sulfur dioxide retrievals, volcanic plume masses,
and eruption totals under low-latitude conditions are evaluated using radiative
transfer simulations and error analysis. The retrieval algorithm is a simultaneous
solution of the absorption optical depth equations including ozone and sulfur
dioxide at the four shortest TOMS wavelengths and an empirical correction based
on background condition residuals. The retrieval algorithm reproduces model
stratospheric sulfur dioxide plume amounts within ±10% over most central scan
angles and moderate solar zenith angles if no aerosols or ash are present. The
errors grow to 30% under large solar zenith angle conditions. Volcanic ash and
sulfate aerosols in the plume in moderate optical depths (0.3) produce an overestimation
of the sulfur dioxide by 15–25% depending on particle size and composition.
Retrievals of tropospheric volcanic plumes are affected by the reflectivity of
the underlying surface or clouds. The precision of individual TOMS SO2 soundings
is limited by data quantization to ±6 Dobson units. The accuracy is independent
of most instrument calibration errors but depends linearly on relative SO2 absorption
cross-section errors at the TOMS wavelengths. Volcanic plume mass estimates are
dependent on correction of background offsets integrated over the plume area.
The errors vary with plume mass and area, thus are highly individual. In general,
they are least for moderate size, compact plumes. Estimates of the total mass of
explosively erupted sulfur dioxide depend on extrapolation of a series of daily
plume masses backward to the time of the eruption. Errors of 15–30% are not unusual.
Effusive eruption total mass estimates are more uncertain due to difficulties
in separating new from old sulfur dioxide in daily observations.},

Abstract = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a molecule of considerable interest for
both atmospheric chemistry and astrophysics. In the Earth’s atmosphere, it enters
in the sulfur cycle and it is ubiquitous present in polluted atmospheres, where

importance, being present on Venus and in interstellar clouds. In this work the
collisional broadening of a number of ν1 ro-vibrational lines of SO2 perturbed

region by means of high resolution tunable diode laser (TDL) infrared spectroscopy.
From N2- and O2-broadening coefficients, the broadening parameters of sulfur
dioxide in air, useful for atmospheric applications, are derived as well.
From the present measurements some conclusions on the quantum number dependence
of the N2-, O2- and He-broadening coefficients are drawn. While the J dependence
is weak for all the perturbers investigated, different trends with Ka are reported.
N2-broadening coefficients show a slight decrease with increasing values of Ka,
whereas O2 and He broadening cross sections first increase up to View the MathML
sourceKa″≈6 and then they keep a nearly constant value. A comparison and a brief
discussion on the efficiency of self-, N2-, O2- and He-collisional dynamics are

Abstract = {Sulfur gases are common components in the volcanic and biological
emission on Earth, and are expected to be important input gases for atmospheres
on terrestrial exoplanets. We study the atmospheric composition and the spectra
of terrestrial exoplanets with sulfur compounds (i.e., H2S and SO2) emitted from
their surfaces. We use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model and
radiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheres
ranging from reducing to oxidizing. The most important finding is that both H2S
and SO2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres on
terrestrial exoplanets, based on models of H2, N2, and CO2 atmospheres. This
implies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their
surface emission rates need to be extremely high (>1000 times Earth's volcanic
sulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also find
that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical formation
of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which would condense
to form aerosols if saturated. For terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone
of Sun-like stars or M stars, Earth-like sulfur emission rates result in optically
thick haze composed of elemental sulfur in reducing H2-dominated atmospheres for
a wide range of particle diameters (0.1-1 μm), which is assumed as a free
parameter in our simulations. In oxidized atmospheres composed of N2 and CO2,
optically thick haze, composed of elemental sulfur aerosols (S8) or sulfuric
acid aerosols (H2SO4), will form if the surface sulfur emission is two orders
of magnitude more than the volcanic sulfur emission of Earth. Although direct
detection of H2S and SO2 by their spectral features is unlikely, their emission
might be inferred by observing aerosol-related features in reflected light with
future generation space telescopes.},

Abstract = {Detailed radiative transfer modeling has been carried out for SO2
and SO originating in the envelope of the O-rich supergiant star VY Canis Majoris
(VY CMa). A total of 27 transitions of SO2 and 7 transitions of SO lying in the
energy range 3.0-138.2 cm–1 were analyzed using a new non-LTE radiative transfer
code that incorporates non-spherical geometries. The spectra were primarily
obtained from the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 1 mm spectral survey of VY CMa,
conducted with the Submillimeter Telescope; additional lines were measured with
the ARO 12 m antenna at 2 and 3 mm. SO2 and SO were found to arise from five
distinct outflows within the envelope, four which are asymmetric with respect
to the star. Three flows arise from high-velocity red-shifted material, one from
a blue-shifted wind, and the final from a classic "spherical" expansion. In the
spherical component, the peak fractional abundance, relative to H2, of both
molecules is f ~ 2.5 × 10–7 at r ~ 25 R *, and steadily decreases outward. SO2
appears to be a "parent" molecule, formed near the stellar photosphere.
In the asymmetric outflows, both SO and SO2 are more prominent at large stellar
radii in dense (106-107 cm–3), clumpy material, achieving their maximum abundance
between 200 and 600 R * with f ~ 3.0 × 10–8-1.5 × 10–7. These results suggest
that in the collimated outflows, both species are either produced by shock
chemistry or are remnant inner shell material swept up in the high-velocity winds.},

Earth-sized to super-Earth-sized exoplanets. We find that sulfur dioxide from
large explosive eruptions does present a spectral signal that is remotely
detectable especially for secondary eclipse measurements around the closest

Abstract = {New measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and monoxide (SO) in the
atmosphere of Venus by SPICAV/SOIR instrument onboard Venus Express orbiter provide
ample statistics to study the behavior of these gases above Venus’ clouds.
The instrument (a set of three spectrometers) is capable to sound atmospheric
structure above the clouds in several observation modes (nadir, solar and stellar
occultations) either in the UV or in the near IR spectral ranges. We present
the results from solar occultations in the absorption ranges of SO2 (190–230 nm,
and at 4 μm) and SO (190–230 nm). The dioxide was detected by the SOIR spectrometer
at the altitudes of 65–80 km in the IR and by the SPICAV spectrometer at 85–105
km in the UV. The monoxide’s absorption was measured only by SPICAV at 85–105 km.
We analyzed 39 sessions of solar occultation, where boresights of both spectrometers
are oriented identically, to provide complete vertical profiling of SO2 of the
Venus’ mesosphere (65–105 km). Here we report the first firm detection and measurements
of two SO2 layers. In the lower layer SO2 mixing ratio is within 0.02–0.5 ppmv.
The upper layer, also conceivable from microwave measurements by Sandor et al.
(Sandor, B.J., Todd Clancy, R., Moriarty-Schieven, G., Mills, F.P. [2010].
Icarus 208, 49–60) is characterized by SO2 increasing with the altitude from 0.05
to 2 ppmv, and the [SO2]/[SO] ratio varying from 1 to 5. The presence of
the high-altitude SOx species could be explained by H2SO4 photodissociation
under somewhat warmer temperature conditions in Venus mesosphere. At 90–100 km
the content of the sulfur dioxide correlates with temperature increasing from
0.1 ppmv at 165–170 K to 0.5–1 ppmv at 190–192 K. It supports the hypothesis of
SO2 production by the evaporation of H2SO4 from droplets and its subsequent
photolysis at around 100 km.},

identified as the dominant molecule synthesized in the SO2 ice. This is also the
case after irradiation of composite samples of SO2 with sulfur, or disulfites.
Darkening was observed in irradiated SO2 ice and in irradiated S8 pellets.
Photometric and spectral measurements of the thermoluminescence of irradiated SO2
have been made during warming. The spectrum appears as a broad band with a maximum
at 4450 Å. Analysis of the luminescence data suggests that, at Ionian temperatures,
irradiated SO2 ice would not be a dominant contributor to posteclipse brightening
phenomena. After warming to room temperature, a form of SO3 remains along with a
sulfate and S8. Based on these experiments, it is reasonable to propose that small
amounts of SO3 may exist on the surface of Io as a result of irradiation synthesis

Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that sulfur played an important role on
   early Mars. Sulfur is distributed ubiquitously on the Martian surface,
   and sulfur in Martian meteorites carries the signature of atmospheric
   interactions. Recent work suggests that the radiative properties of
   sulfur volatiles that were degassed into the Martian atmosphere may have
   caused a greenhouse effect early in the planet's history. It remains
   unclear, however, over what timescales warming from sulfur volatiles
   would have persisted, and consequently how significant this warming may
   have been. While most photochemistry research to date has concentrated
   on current Martian conditions, the ancient Martian atmosphere was
   thicker, warmer, and more reducing than the current regime. Here we
   investigate sulfur photochemistry in a 500 mb ancient Martian
   atmosphere. After adapting a model used to study sulfur photochemistry
   on Earth during the Archean, we find a short lifetime for SO2 in the
   current Martian atmosphere, similar to results of other photochemical
   studies. However, our simulations suggest that moderate mixing ratios of
   SO2 (10(-8) <= f(SO2) <= 10(-6)) could have persisted in the ancient

the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. By presenting
and modelling a large number of SO and SO2 lines in the low mass-loss rate M-type
AGB star R Dor, and modelling the available lines of those molecules in a further
four M-type AGB stars, we aim to determine their circumstellar abundances and
distributions. We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated
lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and SO2 line emission and molecular
data files for both SO and SO2 that are more extensive than those previously
available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2 lines to constrain our models for R Dor,
we find an SO abundance of 6.7e−6 and an SO2 abundance of 5e−6 with both species
having high abundances close to the star. We also modelled 34SO and found an
abundance of 3.1e−7, giving an 32SO/34SO ratio of 21.6. We derive similar results
for the circumstellar SO and SO2 abundances and their distributions for the
low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the circumstellar SO and SO2
abundances are much higher than predicted by chemical models and these two
species may account for all available sulphur. For the higher mass-loss rate
stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with peak abundances that decrease
and peak abundance radii that increase with increasing mass-loss rate.
The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very well with the photodissociation
radii of H2O. We find evidence that SO is most likely through the photodissociation
of H2O and the subsequent reaction between S and OH. The S-bearing parent
molecule appears not to be H2S. The SO2 models suggest an origin close to the
star for this species, also disagreeing with current chemical models.},

  abstract = {Abstract Using the latest published, empirically refined potential
 energy surface (PES) Ames-1 and purely ab initio CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ dipole
 moment surface (DMS), we have computed Infrared line lists for five symmetric
  isotopologues of sulfur dioxide: 32S16O2 (626), 33S16O2 (636), 34S16O2 (646),
   36S16O2 (666), and 32S18O2 (828). The line lists are based on J=0-80
   rovibrational variational calculations with E’ ⩽ 8000 cm-1. The 34S16O2 and
   33S16O2 line lists are compared to the experiment-based models in the
    HIgh-resolution \{TRANsmission\} molecular absorption database (HITRAN2012,
    http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/) and the Cologne Database for Molecular
    Spectroscopy, \{CDMS\} (http://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms/). The accuracy
    for computed 646 band origins is similar to what has been reported for the
    main isotopologue, i.e. 0.01 - 0.03 cm-1 for bands up to 5500 cm-1. For
    rovibrational transitions, the 646 line position and intensity deviation
    patterns are much simpler and more self-consistent than those of the main
    isotopologue 626. The discrepancies are mainly found for higher Ka/J transitions.
    626 and 646 exhibit comparable line position and intensity agreement for
    lower Ka/J transitions. The line position deviations for the 636 purely
    rotational band are parallel to those of 626 and 646, while its line intensity
    deviations do not show branching patterns as we found in the 626 and 646
    cases. Predictions for the other minor isotopologues are expected to exhibit
    similar accuracy. These line lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives
    for missing bands of 626 and the minor isotopologues. It may significantly
    facilitate the laboratory spectroscopic measurement and analysis, as well
    as to identify these isotopologues in various astrophysical environments.},

  abstract = {Sulfur dioxide is still the subject of numerous spectroscopic studies
since it plays an active role in the chemistry of Earth’s atmosphere and it is
a molecule of proven astrophysical importance. In the present work we have
determined the self-broadening and integrated absorption coefficients for several
lines in the ν1 band spectral region around 9.2 μm. Besides the parameters of the
lines belonging to the ν1 fundamental of S32O2, also those for some rovibrational
lines of the ν1+ν2−ν2 hot band of the S32O2 isotopologue and the ν1 band of the
S34O2 isotopic species have been determined. The measurements have been carried
out at 297 K using a tunable diode laser spectrometer. The self-broadening parameters
have also been theoretically determined employing a semiclassical formalism based
on the Anderson–Tsao–Curnutte approximation. The study has been completed with
the determination of the vibrational cross sections of the three fundamental
bands measured from the spectra recorded at a resolution of 0.2 cm−1 using a
Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.},

ISO/SWS spectra of oxygen-rich AGB stars. The band is clearly detected in three
stars, UX Cyg, o Cet and T Cep, and marginally detected in at least four other stars.
The band is seen in absorption in UX Cyg, while it is in emission in o Cet.
Seven spectra of T Cep taken at different phases show that the feature changes
from emission to absorption on a time scale of twice the pulsation period. Using
an LTE model, we find that the excitation temperature of SO_2 is typically 600 K,
and that in T Cep the molecule occupies a region with dimensions of several stellar
radii. The total number of molecules contained in this region is of order 10(47),
which requires a local gas density of at least 10(9) H_2 cm(-3) , and possibly up
to 10(11) H_2 cm(-3) depending on the SO_2 abundance. The variation with phase of
the T Cep spectra can be explained by photodissociation of SO_2 molecules by soft UV photons.

The hard‐sphere collision diameter corresponding to this is 5.68 Å as compared
to the kinetic collision diameter of 4.0 Å. The result has been interpreted on
the basis of Anderson's theory assuming a dipole—quadrupole interaction to be
responsible for the width. The quadrupole moment of nitrogen so evaluated is
equal to 2.79×10—26 esu. The temperature dependence of the linewidth parameter
has also been calculated and it has been found that for the temperature range
340°—600°K, Δν varies as T—0·78 and for the temperature range 195°—340°K, Δν

Title = {A semi-classical approach to the calculation of highly excited

Abstract = {We report a new semi-classical method to compute highly excited
   rotational energy levels of an asymmetric-top molecule. The method
   forgoes the idea of a full quantum mechanical treatment of the
   ro-vibrational motion of the molecule. Instead, it employs a
   semi-classical Green's function approach to describe the rotational
   motion, while retaining a quantum mechanical description of the
   vibrations. Similar approaches have existed for some time, but the
   method proposed here has two novel features. First, inspired by the path
   integral method, periodic orbits in the phase space and tunneling paths
   are naturally obtained by means of molecular symmetry analysis. Second,
   the rigorous variational method is employed for the first time to
   describe the molecular vibrations. In addition, we present a new robust
   approach to generating rotational energy surfaces for vibrationally
   excited states; this is done in a fully quantum-mechanical, variational
   manner. The semi-classical approach of the present work is applied to
   calculating the energies of very highly excited rotational states and it
   reduces dramatically the computing time as well as the storage and
   memory requirements when compared to the fullly quantum-mechanical
   variational approach. Test calculations for excited states of SO2 yield
   semi-classical energies in very good agreement with the available
   experimental data and the results of fully quantum-mechanical
   calculations.},
