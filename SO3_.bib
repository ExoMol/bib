  abstract = {Ab initio potential energy and dipole moment surfaces are computed
	for sulfur trioxide (SO3) at the CCSD(T)-F12b level of theory with
	appropriate triple-zeta basis sets. The analytical representations
	of these surfaces are used, with a slight correction, to compute
	pure rotational and rotation-vibration spectra of (SO3)-S-32-O-16
	using the variational nuclear motion program TROVE. The calculations
	considered transitions in the region 0-4000 {cm$^{-1}$} with rotational
	states up to J = 85. The resulting line list of 174 674 257 transitions
	is appropriate for modelling room temperature (SO3)-S-32-O-16 spectra.
	Good agreement is found with the observed infrared absorption spectra
	and the calculations are used to place the measured relative intensities
	on an absolute scale. A list of 10 878 experimental transitions is
	provided in a form suitable for inclusion in standard atmospheric
	and planetary spectroscopic databases.},

Abstract = {The structure of the purely rotational spectrum of sulphur trioxide
   (SO3)-S-32-O-16 is investigated using a new synthetic line list. The
   list combines line positions from an empirical model with line
   intensities determined, in the form of Einstein coefficients, from
   variationally computed ro-vibrational wavefunctions in conjunction with
   an ab initio dipole moment surface. The empirical model providing the
   line positions involves an effective, Watsonian-type rotational
   Hamiltonian with literature parameter values resulting from
   least-squares fittings to observed transition frequencies. The formation
   of so-called 6-fold rotational energy clusters at high rotational
   excitation are investigated. The SO3 molecule is planar at equilibrium
   and exhibits a unique type of rotational-energy clustering associated
   with unusual stabilization axes perpendicular to the S-O bonds. This
   behaviour is characterized theoretically in the J range from 100-250.
   The wavefunctions for these cluster states are analysed, and the results
   are compared to those of a classical analysis in terms of the
   rotational-energy-surface formalism. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},
