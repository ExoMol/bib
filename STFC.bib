Abstract = {Ground-based high-dispersion spectroscopy could reveal molecular oxygen
   as a biomarker gas in the atmospheres of twin-Earths transiting red
   dwarf stars within the next 25 years. The required contrasts are only a
   factor of 3 lower than that already achieved for carbon monoxide in hot
   Jupiter atmospheres today but will need much larger telescopes because
   the target stars will be orders of magnitude fainter. If
   extraterrestrial life is very common and can therefore be found on
   planets around the most nearby red dwarf stars, it may be detectable via
   transmission spectroscopy with the next-generation extremely large
   telescopes. However, it is likely that significantly more collecting
   area is required for this. This can be achieved through the development
   of low-cost flux collector technology, which combines a large collecting
   area with a low but sufficient image quality for high-dispersion
   spectroscopy of bright stars.},

  abstract={Exoplanet observations promise one day to unveil the presence of extraterrestrial life. Atmospheric compounds in strong chemical disequilibrium would point to large-scale biological activity just as oxygen and methane do in the Earth's atmosphere. The cancellation of both the Terrestrial Planet Finder and Darwin missions means that it is unlikely that a dedicated space telescope to search for biomarker gases in exoplanet atmospheres will be launched within the next 25 years. Here we show that ground-based telescopes provide a strong alternative for finding biomarkers in exoplanet atmospheres through transit observations. Recent results on hot Jupiters show the enormous potential of high-dispersion spectroscopy to separate the extraterrestrial and telluric signals, making use of the Doppler shift of the planet. The transmission signal of oxygen from an Earth-twin orbiting a small red dwarf star is only a factor of three smaller than that of carbon monoxide recently detected in the hot Jupiter t Boötis b, albeit such a star will be orders of magnitude fainter. We show that if Earth-like planets are common, the planned extremely large telescopes can detect oxygen within a few dozen transits. Ultimately, large arrays of dedicated flux-collector telescopes equipped with high-dispersion spectrographs can provide the large collecting area needed to perform a statistical study of life-bearing planets in the solar neighborhood.}

Abstract = {Spectroscopic observations of exoplanets are now possible by transit
   methods and direct emission. Spectroscopic requirements for exoplanets
   are reviewed based on existing measurements and model predictions for
   hot Jupiters and super-Earths. Molecular opacities needed to simulate
   astronomical observations can be obtained from laboratory measurements,
   ab initio calculations or a combination of the two approaches. This
   discussion article focuses mainly on laboratory measurements of hot

  abstract={We study the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere to derive detectable features in low resolution of different global geochemical cycles on exoplanets—using the sulfur cycle as our example. We derive low-resolution detectable features for first generation space- and ground-based telescopes as a first step in comparative planetology. We assume that the surfaces and atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets (Earth-like and super-Earths) will most often be dominated by a specific geochemical cycle. Here we concentrate on the sulfur cycle driven by outgassing of SO 2 and H 2 S followed by their transformation to other sulfur-bearing species, which is clearly distinguishable from the carbon cycle, which is driven by outgassing of CO 2 . Due to increased volcanism, the sulfur cycle is potentially the dominant global geochemical cycle on dry super-Earths with active tectonics. We calculate planetary emission, reflection, and transmission spectrum from 0.4 µm to 40 µm with high and low resolution to assess detectable features using current and Archean Earth models with varying SO 2 and H 2 S concentrations to explore reducing and oxidizing habitable environments on rocky planets. We find specific spectral signatures that are observable with low resolution in a planetary atmosphere with high SO 2 and H 2 S concentration. Therefore, first generation space- and ground-based telescopes can test our understanding of geochemical cycles on rocky planets and potentially distinguish planetary environments dominated by the carbon and sulfur cycles.}

  abstract={We use thermodynamic calculations to model atmospheric chemistry on terrestrial exoplanets that are hot enough for chemical equilibria between the atmosphere and lithosphere, as on Venus. The results of our calculations place constraints on abundances of spectroscopically observable gases, the surface temperature and pressure, and the mineralogy of the planetary surface. These results will be useful in planning future observations of the atmospheres of terrestrial-sized exoplanets by current and proposed space observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope , Spitzer , the James Webb Space Telescope , and Darwin .}
