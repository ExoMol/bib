Abstract = {We present the results of ab initio calculations for the lower
   electronic states of the Group 15 (pnictogen) dihydrides, SbH2 and BiH2.
   For each of these molecules the two lowest electronic states become
   degenerate at linearity and are therefore subject to the Renner effect.
   Spin-orbit coupling is also strong in these two heavy-element containing
   molecules. For the lowest two electronic states of SbH2, we construct
   the three dimensional potential energy surfaces and corresponding dipole
   moment and transition moment surfaces by multi-reference configuration
   interaction techniques. Including both the Renner effect and spin-orbit
   coupling, we calculate term values and simulate the rovibrational and
   rovibronic spectra of SbH2. Excellent agreement is obtained with the
   results of matrix isolation infrared spectroscopic studies and with gas
   phase electronic spectroscopic studies in absorption. For the heavier
   dihydride BiH2 we calculate bending potential curves and the spin-orbit
   coupling constant for comparison. For SbH2 we further study the local
   mode vibrational behavior and the formation of rovibronic energy level
   clusters in high angular momentum states.},
