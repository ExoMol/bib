  abstract = {Overtones of the Si-H stretching-bending polyad of the SiHD3 molecule
	are studied using an internal coordinate force field model. The potential
	parameters are optimized by fitting to the experimental band centers.
	The Fermi resonance between the Si-H stretching and bending motions
	is insignificant due to cancellation of the contributions from kinetic
	and potential terms. This suggests a slow redistribution of vibrational
	energy between these two degrees of freedom and induces local mode
	character of respective vibrations. Band intensities are calculated
	by using ah initio one- and three-dimensional dipole moment surfaces
	(DMS). These agree reasonably well with the observations. The successful
	reproduction of relative intensities between the (n(1) - 1)v(1) +
	2v(5) stretching-bending combination bands and the n(1)v(1) stretching
	bands establishes the importance of the bending motion in the multidimensional
	DMS for intensity investigations.},
