abstract = "Abstract The singlet states of SiO that correlate with ground state atoms have been studied. The computed spectroscopic constants are in good agreement with experiment. The lifetime of the E state has been calculated to be 10.9 ns; this is larger than the results of previous computations and is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 10.5 ± 1.1 ns. The lifetime of the A state is about three times larger than found in experiment. We suggest that absorption from the X state to the (2) 1 Π state is responsible for the unidentified lines in the experiment of Hormes et al. "

Title = {{DISCOVERY OF SiO BAND EMISSION FROM GALACTIC B{[}e] SUPERGIANTS}},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{800}},
Abstract = {{B{[}e] supergiants (B{[}e]SGs) are evolved massive stars in a
   short-lived transition phase. During this phase, these objects eject
   large amounts of material, which accumulate in a circumstellar disk-like
   structure. The expelled material is typically dense and cool, providing
   the cradle for molecule and dust condensation and for a rich, ongoing
   chemistry. Very little is known about the chemical composition of these
   disks, beyond the emission from dust and CO revolving around the star on
   Keplerian orbits. As massive stars preserve an oxygen-rich surface
   composition throughout their life, other oxygen-based molecules can be
   expected to form. As SiO is the second most stable oxygen compound, we
   initiated an observing campaign to search for first-overtone SiO
   emission bands. We obtained high-resolution near-infrared L-band spectra
   for a sample of Galactic B{[}e] SGs with reported CO band emission. We
   clearly detect emission from the SiO first-overtone bands in CPD-52 9243
   and indications for faint emission in HD 62623, HD 327083, and CPD-57
   2874. From model fits, we find that in all these stars the SiO bands are
   rotationally broadened with a velocity lower than observed in the CO
   band forming regions, suggesting that SiO forms at larger distances from
   the star. Hence, searching for and analyzing these bands is crucial for
   studying the structure and kinematics of circumstellar disks, because
   they trace complementary regions to the CO band formation zone.
   Moreover, since SiO molecules are the building blocks for silicate dust,
   their study might provide insight in the early stage of dust formation.}},

Abstract = {{The interstellar medium is enriched primarily by matter ejected from
   evolved low and intermediate mass stars. The outflows from these stars
   create a circumstellar envelope in which a rich gas-phase and
   dust-nucleation chemistry takes place. We observed the nearest
   carbon-rich evolved star, IRC + 10216, using the PACS (55-210 mu m) and
   SPIRE (194-672 mu m) spectrometers on board Herschel. We find several
   tens of lines from SiS and SiO, including lines from the v = 1
   vibrational level. For SiS these transitions range up to J = 124-123,
   corresponding to energies around 6700 K, while the highest detectable
   transition is J = 90-89 for SiO, which corresponds to an energy around
   8400 K. Both species trace the dust formation zone of IRC + 10216, and
   the broad energy ranges involved in their detected transitions permit us
   to derive the physical properties of the gas and the particular zone in
   which each species has been formed. This allows us to check the accuracy
   of chemical thermodynamical equilibrium models and the suggested
   depletion of SiS and SiO due to accretion onto dust grains.}},

   across the maser lines shows no tendency toward that expected for simple
   Zeeman splitting. The fractional circular polarization greatly exceeds
   that expected from the alternate mechanism. The overall shape of the

   The intensity of the emission waxes and wanes during the stellar phase.

Journal = APJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {733},
Abstract = {Using the integral field spectrograph OSIRIS, on the Keck II telescope,
   broad near-infrared H- and K-band spectra of the young exoplanet HR8799b
   have been obtained. In addition, six new narrowband photometric
   measurements have been taken across the H and K bands. These data are
   combined with previously published photometry for an analysis of the
   planet's atmospheric properties. Thick photospheric dust cloud opacity
   is invoked to explain the planet's red near-IR colors and relatively
   smooth near-IR spectrum. Strong water absorption is detected, indicating
   a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Only weak CH(4) absorption is detected at K
   band, indicating efficient vertical mixing and a disequilibrium CO/CH(4)
   ratio at photospheric depths. The H-band spectrum has a distinct
   triangular shape consistent with low surface gravity. New giant planet
   atmosphere models are compared to these data with best-fitting bulk
   parameters, T(eff) = 1100 K +/- 100 and log(g) = 3.5 +/- 0.5 (for solar
   composition). Given the observed luminosity (log L(obs)/L(circle dot)
   similar to -5.1), these values correspond to a radius of 0.75
   R(Jup-0.12)(+0.17) and a mass of similar to 0.72
   M(Jup-0.6)(+2.6)-strikingly inconsistent with interior/evolution models.
   Enhanced metallicity (up to similar to 10x that of the Sun) along with
   thick clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry are likely required to
   reproduce the complete ensemble of spectroscopic and photometric data
   and the low effective temperatures (< 1000 K) required by the evolution
   models.},

Title = {MASER PROPERTIES OF THE ENIGMATIC IRAS SOURCE 19312+1950},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {728},
Abstract = {The IRAS source, 19312+1950, exhibits SiO maser emission, which is
   predominantly detected in evolved stars enshrouded by a cold molecular
   envelope. In fact, the majority of the observational properties of IRAS
   19312+1950 are consistent with the nature of an asymptotic giant branch
   (AGB) star or post-AGB star. Interestingly, however, some of the
   observational properties cannot be readily explained within the standard
   scheme of stellar evolution, and those are rather reminiscent of young
   stellar objects. In the present research, we considered the evolutionary
   status of IRAS 19312+1950 as revealed by the very long baseline
   interferometry and MERLIN observations in SiO, H(2)O, and OH maser
   lines. The double-peaked profile of the 22 GHz H(2)O maser line is
   clearly detected, with the emission regions of its redshifted and
   blueshifted components separately located, leaving a space of about 10.9
   mas between them. The kinematic properties of the H(2)O maser emission
   region appear to be more consistent with a bipolar flow rather than
   other interpretations such as the Keplerian rotation of a disk. The
   redshifted component of the SiO maser emission, which exhibits a
   double-peak profile in previous single-dish observations, is clearly
   detected in the present interferometry, while the 1612 MHz OH maser line
   exhibits a complicated line profile consisting of a single strong peak
   and many weak, high-velocity spikes. The structure of the OH maser
   emission region is partially resolved, and the kinematic properties of
   the OH maser emission region are observations reminiscent of a
   spherically expanding shell, even though the evidence is scant.
   Collectively, the maser observations described here provide additional
   support for the evolved star hypothesis for IRAS 19312+1950.},

Title = {MAGNETIC FIELDS IN EVOLVED STARS: IMAGING THE POLARIZED EMISSION OF
   HIGH-FREQUENCY SiO MASERS},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {728},
Abstract = {We present Submillimeter Array observations of high-frequency SiO masers
   around the supergiant VX Sgr and the semi-regular variable star W Hya.
   The J = 5-4, v = 1(28)SiO and v = 0(29)SiO masers of VX Sgr are shown to
   be highly linearly polarized with a polarization from similar to 5\% to
   60\%. Assuming the continuum emission peaks at the stellar position, the
   masers are found within similar to 60 mas of the star, corresponding to
   similar to 100 AU at a distance of 1.57 kpc. The linear polarization
   vectors are consistent with a large-scale magnetic field, with position
   and inclination angles similar to that of the dipole magnetic field
   inferred in the H(2)O and OH maser regions at much larger distances from
   the star. We thus show for the first time that the magnetic field
   structure in a circumstellar envelope can remain stable from a few
   stellar radii out to similar to 1400 AU. This provides further evidence
   supporting the existence of large-scale and dynamically important
   magnetic fields around evolved stars. Due to a lack of parallactic angle
   coverage, the linear polarization of masers around W Hya could not be
   determined. For both stars, we observed the (28)SiO and (29)SiO
   isotopologues and find that they have a markedly different distributions
   and that they appear to avoid each other. Additionally, emission from
   the SO 5(5)-4(4) line was imaged for both sources. Around W Hya, we find
   a clear offset between the red-and blueshifted SO emission. This
   indicates that W Hya is likely host to a slow bipolar outflow or a
   rotating disk-like structure.},

Title = {SiO outflows in high-mass star forming regions: A potential chemical
   clock?},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {526},
Abstract = {Context. Some theoretical models propose that O-B stars form via
   accretion, in a similar fashion to low-mass stars. Jet-driven molecular
   outflows play an important role in this scenario, and their study can
   help to understand the process of high-mass star formation and the
   different evolutionary phases involved.
   Aims. Observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour an
   evolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with Class 0
   objects while more evolved Class I/II objects show less evidence of
   powerful jets. The present study aims at checking whether an analogous
   picture can be found in the high-mass case.
   Methods. The IRAM 30-m telescope (Spain) has been used to perform
   single-pointing SiO(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57
   high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. Continuum
   data at different wavelengths, from mid-IR to 1.2 mm, have been gathered
   to build the spectral energy distributions of all the clumps and
   estimate their bolometric luminosities.
   Results. SiO emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecular
   jets, is detected in 88\% of our sources, a very high detection rate
   indicating that there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the
   sources of our sample. The SiO(2-1) luminosity drops with L(bol)/M,
   which suggests that jet activity declines as time evolves. This
   represents the first clear evidence of a decrease of SiO outflow
   luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample of high-mass molecular
   clumps in different evolutionary stages. The SiO(3-2) to SiO(2-1)
   integrated intensity ratio shows only minor changes with evolutionary
   state.},

   dramatic change several weeks after the burst; the component on the
   higher-velocity side of the systemic velocity disappeared two weeks
   after the burst, and a new persistent component appeared on the
   lower-velocity side later. These observations indicate that the SiO
   emitting regions were wiped out on a time scale of two weeks by the nova
   shock, but a part of the masing region was quickly replenished by cool
   molecular gases expelled by the mira pulsation.},

Pages = {1084-1104},
Abstract = {A spectral survey of the W51 e1/e2 star-forming region at 84-115 GHz has
   yielded detections of 105 molecules and their isotopic species, from
   simple diatomic or triatomic molecules, such as CO, CS, HCN, up to
   complex organic compounds, such as CH(3)OCH(3), CH(3)COCH(3), and
   C(2)H(5)OOCH. Ninety-three lines that are absent from the Lovas list of
   molecular lines observed from space were detected, and approximately
   half of these were identified. A significant number of the
   detectedmolecules are typical for hot cores. These include the neutral
   molecules CH(3)OCHO, C(2)H(5)OH, CH(3)COCH(3) etc., which are currently
   believed to exist in the gas phase only in hot cores and shock-heated
   gas. In addition, vibrationally excited SiO, C(4)H, HCN, l-C(3)H, HCCCN,
   CH(3)CN, CH(3)OH, H(2)O, and SO(2) lines with upper-level temperatures
   of several hundred Kelvin were found. Such lines can arise only in hot
   gas with temperatures of the order of 100 K or higher. Apart from
   neutral molecules, various molecular ions were also detected. Some of
   these (N(2)H(+), HCO(+), HCS(+)) usually exist in molecular clouds with
   high visual extinctions A (V) . At the same time, the CF(+) ion should
   be observed in photon-dominated regions with A (V) values of about unity
   or lower. An interesting result is the tentative detection of two
   molecules that have thus far been observed only in the atmospheres of
   late-type giant stars-MgCN and NaCN. This suggests that the conditions
   in the hottest W51 regions (probably, in the vicinities of protostars)
   are close to those in the atmospheres of giant stars. It would be
   desirable to search for other lines of these molecules to verify these
   tentative detections. Analysis of the radial velocities of the detected
   molecules suggests that the contribution from the e2 core dominates the
   emission of some O-bearing molecules (CH(3)OCHO, CH(3)CH(2)OH), while
   the contribution of the e1 core dominates the emission of some N-bearing
   molecules (e.g., CH(3)CH(2)CN). Thus, the molecular composition of the
   e2 core may be closer to the composition of the ``Compact Ridge{''} in
   OMC-1, while the composition of the e1 core is closer to that for the
   ``Hot Core{''} in the same cloud.},

Abstract = {We present the Spitzer Atlas of Stellar Spectra, which includes 159
   stellar spectra (5-32 mu m; R similar to 100) taken with the Infrared
   Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. This Atlas gathers
   representative spectra of a broad section of the Hertzsprung-Russell
   diagram, intended to serve as a general stellar spectral reference in
   the mid-infrared. It includes stars from all luminosity classes, as well
   as Wolf-Rayet (WR) objects. Furthermore, it includes some objects of
   intrinsic interest, such as blue stragglers and certain pulsating
   variables. All of the spectra have been uniformly reduced, and all are
   available online. For dwarfs and giants, the spectra of early-type
   objects are relatively featureless, characterized by the presence of
   hydrogen lines in A spectral types. Besides these, the most noticeable
   photospheric features correspond to water vapor and silicon monoxide in
   late-type objects and methane and ammonia features at the latest
   spectral types. Most supergiant spectra in the Atlas present evidence of
   circumstellar gas and/or dust. The sample includes five M supergiant
   spectra, which show strong dust excesses and in some cases polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon features. Sequences of WR stars present the
   well-known pattern of lines of He I and He II, as well as forbidden
   lines of ionized metals. The characteristic flat-top shape of the {[}Ne
   III] line is evident even at these low spectral resolutions. Several
   Luminous Blue Variables and other transition stars are present in the
   Atlas and show very diverse spectra, dominated by circumstellar gas and
   dust features. We show that the {[}8]-{[}24] Spitzer colors (IRAC and
   MIPS) are poor predictors of spectral type for most luminosity classes.},

Abstract = {We present an analysis of Spitzer-IRS spectroscopic maps of the L1157
   protostellar outflow in the H(2) pure-rotational lines from S(0) to
   S(7). The aim of this work is to derive the physical conditions
   pertaining to the warm molecular gas and study their variations within
   the flow. The mid-IR H(2) emission follows the morphology of the
   precessing flow, with peaks correlated with individual CO clumps and
   H(2) 2.12 mu m ro-vibrational emission. More diffuse emission
   delineating the CO cavities is detected only in the low-laying
   transitions, with J(lower) <= 2. The H(2) line images have been used to
   construct two-dimensional maps of N(H(2)), H(2) ortho-to-para ratio
   (OPR), and temperature spectral index beta, in the assumption of a gas
   temperature stratification where the H(2) column density varies as
   T(-beta). Variations of these parameters are observed along the flow. In
   particular, the OPR ranges from similar to 0.6 to 2.8, highlighting the
   presence of regions subject to recent shocks where the OPR has not had
   time yet to reach the equilibrium value. Near-IR spectroscopic data on
   ro-vibrational H(2) emission have been combined with the mid-IR data and
   used to derive additional shock parameters in the brightest blueshifted
   and redshifted emission knots. A high abundance of atomic hydrogen
   (H/H(2) similar to 0.1-0.3) is implied by the observed H(2) column
   densities, assuming n(H(2)) values as derived by independent SiO
   observations. The presence of a high fraction of atomic hydrogen
   indicates that a partially dissociative shock component should be
   considered for the H(2) excitation in these localized regions. However,
   planar shock models, either of C-or J-type, are not able to consistently
   reproduce all the physical parameters derived from our analysis of the
   H(2) emission. Globally, H(2) emission contributes to about 50\% of the
   total shock radiated energy in the L1157 outflow. We find that the
   momentum flux through the shocks derived from the radiated luminosity is
   comparable to the thrust of the associated molecular outflow, supporting
   the scenario where the latter is driven by the shock working surface.},

Abstract = {Maser spectra of the long period variable star R Cassiopeia (R Cas) have
   been observed over approximately four stellar periods in the silicon
   monoxide v = 1 and v = 2, J = 1 - 0 transition. The linear polarization
   characteristics of the spectra have been determined. The lifetimes and
   beginning and ending phases of 43 maser features have been extracted
   from Gaussian fits to the polarized spectra. It has been proposed that
   the maser emissions of long-period variables are affected by the passage
   of a shock wave through the circumstellar region in which the masers
   originate. The proposed shock passage produces a fading or absence of
   the emission by phase 0.4 (for v = 1 and v = 2). Our study found that
   five SiO maser features went out of existence between phases 0.3 and 0.4
   for v = 1 and v = 2 (total number of features: 19 for v = 1, 24 for v =
   2). In no other phase interval did more than three features go out of
   existence. This result is in accordance with the above proposition.},

Pages = {L56-L61},
Abstract = {We present the Australia Telescope Compact Array observations of the SiO
   masers in the Galactic center (GC) in transitions of v = 1, J = 2-1 at
   86 GHz and v = 1, J = 1-0 at 43 GHz. Two 86 GHz SiO masers were detected
   within the central parsec, and they are associated with IRS 10EE and IRS
   15NE, respectively. We detected eighteen 43 GHz SiO masers within a
   projected separation of less than or similar to 2 pc from Sagittarius
   A{*}, among which seven masers are newly discovered from our
   observations. This raises the total number of 43 GHz SiO masers within
   the central 4 pc of the GC region to 22. Simultaneous observations at 86
   and 43 GHz showed that the intensity of 43 GHz SiO maser is similar to 3
   times higher than that of 86 GHz maser in IRS 10EE (an OH/IR star),
   while the integrated flux of the SiO maser emission at 43 GHz is
   comparable with that at 86 GHz in IRS 15NE (an ordinary Mira variable).
   These results are consistent with previous observations of massive
   late-type stars in the Galaxy in which the 86 GHz SiO maser is in
   general weaker than the 43 GHz SiO maser in OH/IR stars, while the two
   transitions are comparably strong in Mira stars.},

Abstract = {We present the results of simultaneous observations of SiO upsilon = 1,

   lines performed with the KVN Yonsei 21 m radio telescope from 2009
   November to 2010 January. We searched for these masers in 47 symbiotic
   stars and detected maser emission from 21 stars, giving the first time
   detection from 19 stars. Both SiO and H(2)O masers were detected from
   seven stars of which six were D-type symbiotic stars and one was an
   S-type star, WRAY 15-1470. In the SiO maser emission, the (28)SiO
   upsilon = 1 maser was detected from 10 stars, while the upsilon = 2
   maser was detected from 15 stars. In particular, the (28)SiO upsilon = 2
   maser emission without the upsilon = 1 maser detection was detected from
   nine stars with a detection rate of 60\%, which is much higher than that
   of isolated Miras/red giants. The (29)SiO upsilon = 0 maser emission was
   also detected from two stars, H 2-38 and BF Cyg, together with the
   (28)SiO upsilon = 2 maser. We conclude that these different

Abstract = {We present a new version of the movie of the SiO masers around the Mira

   to discuss the global properties of the emission in the extended
   atmosphere of the star as well as the kinematics of individual
   components. The existence of shock waves and their contribution to the
   morphology and the kinematics of the gas is also examined and compared
   with theoretical models. Contrary to the dominant expansion observed in
   the first cycle, both expansion and contraction are observed in the
   second cycle. The maser variability is correlated with the pulsation of
   the star but not with the optical intensity. Most of the individual
   components identified follow the behaviour of the ring, but there are
   exceptions with more complex three-dimensional trajectories.},

Title = {Capacitance scaling law for diatomic molecules and prediction of their
   electron detachment energies},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {82},
Abstract = {The variation or ``scaling{''} of the quantum capacitances is explored
   for 45 diatomic molecules as a function of their dimensions. Scaling
   trends in the capacitances of these diatomic molecules dictate an
   ``atoms-in-molecules{''} view of their valence energetics. That is,
   experimentally derived quantum capacitances for both homonuclear and
   heteronuclear diatomic molecules scale linearly with the average of the
   mean radii for the outermost orbitals of their component atoms. This is
   in accord with Maxwell's law for classical capacitors formed from two
   conducting atom-sized spheres in tangential contact. However, the
   scaling behavior for the molecules has some nonclassical features.
   Notably, the quantum capacitances extrapolate to nonzero values at zero
   dimensions. Radius-capacitance points of the homonuclear diatomics lie
   primarily along five scaling lines, with each determined by points for
   molecules composed of atoms with the same atomic symmetry (i.e., atoms
   from the same column in the periodic table). Five scaling lines for
   heteronuclear diatomics each are determined by points for molecules of
   the same or similar molecular symmetries. The molecules' quantum
   capacitances are calculated from their ionization potentials (IPs) and
   electron affinities (EAs). Thus, equations or laws for the scaling lines
   impose mutual consistency conditions among these electron detachment
   energies for different diatomics of similar symmetries. By taking
   advantage of this, the linear quantum capacitance scaling laws and ab
   initio atomic mean radii are used to predict IPs for two diatomics with
   known EAs (Ga(2) and SeO), but for which there is no standard value of
   the IP. Similarly, the laws are used to predict EAs that were unknown or
   uncertain for several diatomics (Li(2), LiF, CSe, PN, BF, BCl, SiO, GeO,
   NCl, CaO, SrO, and BaO) with known IPs.},

Title = {EXTREME ACTIVE MOLECULAR JETS IN L1448C},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {717},
Pages = {58-73},
Abstract = {The protostellar jet driven by L1448C was observed in the SiO J = 8-7
   and CO J = 3-2 lines, and 350 GHz dust continuum at similar to 1 `'
   resolution with the Submillimeter Array. A narrow jet from the northern
   source L1448C(N) was observed in the SiO and the high-velocity CO. The
   jet consists of a chain of emission knots with an inter-knot spacing of
   similar to 2 `' (500 AU) and a semi-periodic velocity variation. These
   knots are likely to be the internal bow shocks in the jet beam that were
   formed due to the periodic variation of the ejection velocity with a
   period of similar to 15-20 yr. The innermost pairs of knots, which are
   significant in the SiO map but barely seen in the CO, are located at
   similar to 1 `' ( 250 AU) from the central source, L1448C(N). Since the
   dynamical timescale for the innermost pair is only similar to 10 yr, SiO
   may have been formed in the protostellar wind through the gas-phase
   reaction, or formed on the dust grain and directly released into the gas
   phase by means of shocks. It is found that the jet is extremely active
   with a mechanical luminosity of similar to 7L(circle dot), which is
   comparable to the bolometric luminosity of the central source
   (7.5L(circle dot)). The mass accretion rate onto the protostar derived
   from the mass-loss rate is similar to 10(-5) M(circle dot) yr(-1). Such
   a high mass accretion rate suggests that the mass and the age of the
   central star are 0.03-0.09 M(circle dot) and (4-12)x10(3) yr,
   respectively, implying that the central star is in the very early stage
   of protostellar evolution. The low-velocity CO emission delineates two
   V-shaped shells with a common apex at L1448C(N). The kinematics of these
   shells are reproduced by the model of a wide-opening angle wind. The
   co-existence of the highly collimated jets and the wide-opening angle
   shells can be explained by the ``unified X-wind model{''} in which
   highly collimated jet components correspond to the on-axis density
   enhancement of the wide-opening angle wind. The CO J = 3-2 map also
   revealed the second outflow driven by the southern source L1448C(S)
   located at similar to 8 `'.3 (2000 AU) from L1448C(N). Although
   L1448C(S) is brighter than L1448C(N) in the mid-IR bands, the momentum
   flux of the outflow from L1448C(S) is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude smaller
   than that of the L1448C(N) outflow. It is likely that the evolution of
   L1448C(S) has been strongly affected by the powerful outflow from
   L1448C(N).},

Abstract = {We use thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model iron, magnesium,

   extrasolar giant planets (EGPs), and low-mass stars. The behavior of
   individual Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases and condensates is determined
   as a function of temperature, pressure, and metallicity. Our equilibrium
   results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere. The
   condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently
   removing Fe- bearing species from the gas phase. Monatomic Fe is the
   most abundant Fe- bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L
   dwarfs, and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Mg-
   and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by
   forsterite (Mg(2)SiO(4)) and enstatite (MgSiO(3)) cloud formation.
   Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of
   EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T
   dwarfs. Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in
   the deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs and EGPs, whereas SiH(4) is
   dominant in the deep atmosphere of Jupiter and other gas giant planets.
   Several other Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases become increasingly
   important with decreasing effective temperature. In principle, a number
   of Fe, Mg, and Si gases are potential tracers of weather or diagnostic
   of temperature in substellar atmospheres.},

Title = {VERA observations of SiO maser emission from R Aquarii},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {510},
Abstract = {Aims. We aim to study the spatial distribution of the v = 1 and v = 2 J
   = 1-0 SiO maser emission from R Aqr, a well known stellar symbiotic
   system. In particular, we intend to determine the annual parallax and
   proper motion of the source by means of measurements of the absolute
   coordinates of the maser spots.
   Methods. We performed VLBI observations of the v = 1 and v = 2 J = 1-0
   maser emission, at 7 mm wavelength, using VERA. We present observations
   made in 11 epochs, between December 2004 and October 2006, and
   observations by other authors are also discussed. VERA provides very
   high spatial resolution and accurate astrometric measurements, thanks to
   its double-beam observing system. From fitting ring-like structures to
   the maser spot distributions, we determine absolute J2000 coordinates of
   the central star. (SiO maser emission is known to be distributed around
   the star forming spot rings at a few stellar radii.)
   Results. Maps with accurate absolute coordinates were obtained in 8
   epochs. From the coordinates determined for the central star, we
   measured parallax and linear proper motion. We obtain pi = 4.7 +/- 0.8
   mas, compatible with, but much more accurate than, the Hipparcos value
   (5.07 +/- 3.15 mas), and deduce a distance of R Aqr D = 214(-32)(+45)
   pc. Our accurate astrometry also yields a reliable comparison between
   the spot distributions of both v = 1 and v = 2 J = 1-0 lines. We find
   that both masers come from similar regions, i.e. at similar distances
   from the star and defining common spot clusters, confirming previous
   results. But the coincidences between spots of both lines are very rare,
   within the spatial and spectral resolution of our experiments. This
   result is found for eight epochs, spanning more than one pulsation cycle
   (of the cool Mira-type component). We argue that explaining the finer
   details of the v = 1, 2 J = 1-0 distributions found here would require
   new theoretical efforts. Finally, our observations also allow the study

Title = {A FEATURE MOVIE OF SiO EMISSION 20-100 AU FROM THE MASSIVE YOUNG STELLAR
   OBJECT ORION SOURCE I},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {708},
Pages = {80-92},
Abstract = {We present multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array imaging of the (28)SiO
   nu = 1 and nu = 2, J = 1-0 maser emission toward the massive young
   stellar object (YSO) Orion Source I. Both SiO transitions were observed
   simultaneously with an angular resolution of similar to 0.5 mas (similar
   to 0.2 AU for d = 414 pc) and a spectral resolution of similar to 0.2 km
   s(-1). Here we explore the global properties and kinematics of the
   emission through two 19-epoch animated movies spanning 21 months (from
   2001 March 19 to 2002 December 10). These movies provide the most
   detailed view to date of the dynamics and temporal evolution of
   molecular material within similar to 20-100 AU of a massive (greater
   than or similar to 8 M(circle dot)) YSO. As in previous studies, we find
   that the bulk of the SiO masers surrounding Source I lie in an X-shaped
   locus; the emission in the south and east arms is predominantly
   blueshifted, and emission in the north and west is predominantly
   redshifted. In addition, bridges of intermediate-velocity emission are
   observed connecting the red and blue sides of the emission distribution.
   We have measured proper motions of over 1000 individual maser features
   and found that these motions are characterized by a combination of
   radially outward migrations along the four main maser-emitting arms and
   motions tangent to the intermediate-velocity bridges. We interpret the
   SiO masers as arising from a wide-angle bipolar wind emanating from a
   rotating, edge-on disk. The detection of maser features along extended,
   curved filaments suggests that magnetic fields may play a role in
   launching and/or shaping the wind. Our observations appear to support a
   picture in which stars with masses as high as at least 8M(circle dot)
   form via disk-mediated accretion. However, we cannot yet rule out that
   the Source I disk may have been formed or altered following a recent
   close encounter.},

Abstract = {We report first on two-epoch mapping observations of SiO nu = 3 J = 1-0
   maser emission in the semiregular variable W Hydrae using the Japanese

   on 2009 February 28 was two orders of magnitude smaller than those of
   the v = I and v = 2 emissions, while a month and half later the nu = 3
   flux density suddenly increased by a factor of similar to 25. In
   contrast, the v = 1 and v = 2 flux densities decreased during this
   period, as expected from the optical light curve. At the first epoch,
   the v = 3 maser features were located inside of a ring composed of the
   nu = 1 and nu = 2 features by 6 mas (greater than or similar to 0.5 AU)
   toward the central star. These offsets are meaningfully larger than the
   error of the fitted ring radius and the difference in the ring sizes of
   nu = 1 and nu = 2 masers (less than or similar to 0.2 AU). The present
   result at the first epoch suggests that nu = 3 J = 1-0 SiO masers are
   predominantly excited in a pumping mechanism (e.g., collisional pumping)
   different from that recently proposed on the basis of the line overlap
   with infrared H(2)O lines. Interestingly, the second-epoch observation
   revealed that the nu = 3 features were located on almost the same ring
   as the nu = 2 ring, which is consistent with what line-overlap theory

Abstract = {A group of Mira variables in the solar neighborhood shows unusual

   found a group of stars with large negative radial velocities, which

   that these deviant motions of maser stars are created by periodic
   gravitational perturbation of the Bulge bar, and that the effect appears
   most strongly at radii between corotation and outer Lindblad resonances.
   The resonance effect can explain the displacement of positions from the

Title = {Synthetic photometry for carbon rich giants I. Hydrostatic dust-free
   models},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {503},
Pages = {913-928},
Abstract = {Context. Carbon rich objects represent an important phase during the
   late stages of evolution of low and intermediate mass stars. They
   contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment and to the infrared
   light of galaxies. A proper description of their atmospheres is crucial
   for the determination of fundamental parameters such as effective
   temperature or mass loss rate.
   Aims. We study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of carbon
   stars. In the first paper of this series we focus on objects that can be
   described by hydrostatic models neglecting dynamical phenomena like
   pulsation and mass loss. As a consequence, the reddening due to
   circumstellar dust is not included. Our results are collected in a
   database, which can be used in conjunction with stellar evolution and
   population synthesis calculations involving the AGB.
   Methods. We have computed a grid of 746 spherically symmetric COMARCS
   atmospheres covering effective temperatures between 2400 and 4000 K,
   surface gravities from log(g {[}cm/s(2)]) = 0.0 to -1.0, metallicities
   ranging from the solar value down to one tenth of it and C/O ratios in
   the interval between 1.05 and 5.0. Subsequently, we used these models to
   create synthetic low resolution spectra and photometric data for a large
   number of filter systems. The tables including the results are
   electronically available. First tests of the application on stellar
   evolution calculations are shown.
   Results. We have selected some of the most commonly used colours in
   order to discuss their behaviour as a function of the stellar
   parameters. A comparison with measured data shows that down to 2800 K
   the agreement between predictions and observations of carbon stars is
   good and our results may be used to determine quantities like the
   effective temperature. Below this limit the synthetic colours are much
   too blue. The obvious reason for these problems is the neglect of
   circumstellar reddening and structural changes due to pulsation and mass
   loss.
   Conclusions. The warmer carbon stars with weak pulsation can be
   successfully described by our hydrostatic models. In order to include
   also the cooler objects with intense variations, at least a proper
   treatment of the reddening caused by the dusty envelopes is needed. This
   will be the topic of the second paper of this series.},

   SYSTEM HH 211 AT SUBARCSECOND RESOLUTION},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {699},
Pages = {1584-1594},
Abstract = {HH 211 is a nearby young protostellar system with a highly collimated
   jet. We have mapped it in 352 GHz continuum, SiO (J = 8 - 7), and HCO(+)
   (J = 4 - 3) emission at up to similar to 0 `'.2 resolution with the
   Submillimeter Array (SMA). The continuum source is now resolved into two
   sources, SMM1 and SMM2, with a separation of similar to 84 AU. SMM1 is
   seen at the center of the jet, probably tracing a (inner) dusty disk
   around the protostar driving the jet. SMM2 is seen to the southwest of
   SMM1 and may trace an envelope-disk around a small binary companion. A
   flattened envelope-disk is seen in HCO(+) around SMM1 with a radius of
   similar to 80 AU perpendicular to the jet axis. Its velocity structure
   is consistent with a rotation motion and can be fitted with a Keplerian
   law that yields a mass of similar to 50 +/- 15 M(Jup) (a mass of a brown
   dwarf) for the protostar. Thus, the protostar could be the lowest mass
   source known to have a collimated jet and a rotating flattened
   envelope-disk. A small-scale (similar to 200 AU) low-speed (similar to 2
   km s(-1)) outflow is seen in HCO(+) around the jet axis extending from
   the envelope-disk. It seems to rotate in the same direction as the
   envelope-disk and may carry away part of the angular momentum from the
   envelope-disk. The jet is seen in SiO close to similar to 100 AU from
   SMM1. It is seen with a ``C-shaped{''} bending. It has a transverse
   width of less than or similar to 40 AU and a velocity of similar to 170
   +/- 60 km s(-1). A possible velocity gradient is seen consistently
   across its innermost pair of knots, similar to 0.5 km s(-1) at similar
   to 10 AU, consistent with the sense of rotation of the envelope-disk. If
   this gradient is an upper limit of the true rotational gradient of the
   jet, then the jet carries away a very small amount of angular momentum
   of less than or similar to 5 AU km s(-1) and thus must be launched from
   the very inner edge of the disk near the corotation radius.},

Title = {The modulation of SiO maser polarization by Jovian planets},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {501},
Pages = {647-657},
Abstract = {Aims. Searching for planets in the atmosphere of AGB stars is difficult,
   due to confusion with the stellar wind and pulsations. The aim here is
   to provide a complementary strategy for planet searches in such a dense
   environment.
   Methods. The polarization properties of SiO masers, especially their
   circular polarization, are, under certain conditions, good tracers of
   rapid magnetospheric events. A Jovian planet with a magnetosphere whose
   dipole axis is misaligned with its rotation axis naturally provides such
   conditions. Here I present several models showing that the polarization
   will be periodically modulated.
   Results. The linear and circular polarization of an SiO maser in a
   planetary magnetosphere is modulated by the precessing dipole component
   of the latter. The effect is measurable in saturated masers, while
   unsaturated masers only exhibit weak changes, because of dilution
   effects, and because the circular polarization there stems from the
   Zeeman effect making it as weak as for thermal radiation. The situation
   would change if anisotropic pump- and loss-rates were included, which
   would increase the fractional linear and, via magnetorotation, the
   circular polarization of the modulation.
   Conclusions. Single-dish monitoring with a dense enough time sampling
   and a carefully calibrated polarimeter, in combination with VLBI
   observations, are suited to detecting and locating a periodic modulation
   of the circular maser polarization due to a precessing Jovian
   magnetosphere. The phenomenon will be rare, because a favorable
   arrangement of maser and magnetosphere is needed. Otherwise the
   polarization may be below the detection threshold, especially if the
   maser is unsaturated. Though exhibiting a qualitatively similar
   modulation, linear polarization is likely to suffer more from confusion
   due to dilution of the magnetosphere within the maser cross section,
   even in VLBI observations.},

Journal = APJ,
Year = {2009},

Abstract = {Red optical and near-infrared spectroscopy are presented for SDSS
   J125637.13-022452.4, one of only four L subdwarfs reported to date.
   These data confirm the low-temperature, metal-poor nature of this
   source, as indicated by prominent metal-hydride bands, alkali lines, and
   collision-induced H(2) absorption. The optical and near-infrared spectra
   of SDSS J1256-0224 are similar to those of the sdL4 2MASS
   J16262034+3925190, and we derive a classification of sdL3.5 based on the
   preliminary scheme of Burgasser, Cruz, and Kirkpatrick. The kinematics
   of SDSS J1256-0224 are consistent with membership in the Galactic inner
   halo, with estimated UVW space velocities indicating a slightly
   prograde, eccentric, and inclined Galactic orbit (3.5 less than or
   similar to R less than or similar to 11 kpc; vertical bar Z(max)vertical
   bar = 7.5 kpc). Comparison to synthetic spectra computed with the
   Phoenix code, including the recent implementation of kinetic condensate
   formation (Drift-Phoenix), indicates T(eff) approximate to 2100-2500 K
   and {[}M/H] approximate to -1.5 to -1.0 for log g approximate to 5.0-5.5
   (cgs), although there are clear discrepancies between model and observed
   spectra particularly in the red optical region. As such, any conclusions
   on the role of metallicity in condensate grain and cloud formation are
   probably premature. Indeed, a shift in the temperature scale of L
   subdwarfs relative to L dwarfs may obviate the need for modified
   condensate and grain chemistry in low metallicity atmospheres.},

Title = {Circumstellar molecular line emission from S-type AGB stars: mass-loss
   rates and SiO abundances},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {499},
Pages = {515-U216},
Abstract = {Aims. The main aim is to derive reliable mass-loss rates and
   circumstellar SiO abundances for a sample of 40 S-type AGB stars based
   on new multi-transitional CO and SiO radio line observations. In
   addition, the results are compared to previous results for M-type AGB
   stars and carbon stars to look for trends with chemical type.
   Methods. The circumstellar envelopes are assumed to be spherically
   symmetric and formed by a constant mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates
   are estimated from fitting the CO observations using a non-local,
   non-LTE radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo method. In the
   excitation analysis, the energy balance equation is solved
   self-consistently simultaneously as the radiative transfer and the
   temperature structure of the gas is derived. Effects of dust grains are
   also included in the molecular excitation analysis. Once the physical
   properties of the circumstellar envelopes are determined, the same
   radiative transfer code is used to model the observed SiO lines in order
   to derive circumstellar abundances and the sizes of the SiO
   line-emitting regions.
   Results. We have estimated mass-loss rates of 40 S-type AGB stars and
   find that the derived mass-loss rates have a distribution that resembles
   those previously derived for similar samples of M-type AGB stars and
   carbon stars. The estimated mass-loss rates also correlate well with the
   corresponding expansion velocity of the envelope, in accordance with
   results for M-type AGB stars and carbon stars. In all, this indicates
   that the mass loss is driven by the same mechanism in all three chemical
   types of AGB stars. In addition, we have estimated the circumstellar
   fractional abundance of SiO relative to H(2) in 26 of the sample S-type
   AGB stars. The derived SiO abundances are, on average, about an order of
   magnitude higher than predicted by stellar atmosphere thermal
   equilibrium chemistry, indicating that non-equilibrium chemical
   processes determines the abundance of SiO in the circumstellar envelope.
   Moreover, a comparison with the results for M-type AGB stars and carbon
   stars show that for a certain mass-loss rate, the circumstellar SiO
   abundance seems independent (although with a large scatter) of the
   C/O-ratio.
   Conclusions. In our comparison of S-type AGB stars with carbon stars and
   M-type AGB stars, we find no large differences in circumstellar physical
   properties or SiO abundances depending on the chemical type of the star.},

   X-ray luminosities are too low to maintain a strong, dynamically
   important global field. Other explanations of the circular polarization
   in SiO masers in AGB atmospheres may thus be required.
   Aims. The interaction of the AGB wind with both previously ejected
   matter and planets is expected to produce complex magnetohydro-dynamic
   phenomena on a short timescale, such that strong magnetic fields can be
   maintained locally. Here, we provide observational evidence of the
   corresponding magnetic fluctuations.
   Methods. We use the circular polarization of the v = 1, J = 2-1 SiO
   masers as a tracer of magnetic activity. A correlation polarimeter
   allows us to record simultaneously all Stokes parameters. An SiO maser
   survey of 77 AGB stars was performed from which eight sources of the
   strongest circular polarization were selected for further monitoring.
   Results. In two AGB stars, V Cam and R Leo, we find evidence of
   pseudo-periodic fluctuations in the fractional circular polarization on
   a timescale of a few hours, from which we infer magnetic fluctuations of
   similar to 1 G. The phenomenon is rare and, if detected in an SiO star,
   restricted to a narrow range of velocities. It seems to be associated
   with planetary wake flows suggested by VLBI maps.
   Conclusions. While scenarios involving magnetic activity in the extended
   stellar atmosphere have problems explaining all observed features,
   precessing Jovian magnetospheres predict all of them without difficulty.
   For the case of R Leo, we constrain the orbit of the planet (estimated
   period 5.2 years), derive a stellar mass estimate of 0.7 M(circle dot)
   from it, and discuss the impact of planetary magnetism on the survival
   of planets. Smooth velocity variations in the fluctuating circular
   polarization feature are predicted as the planet moves along its orbit.},

Title = {Shocks in dense clouds II. Dust destruction and SiO formation in J
   shocks},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {497},
Pages = {145-153},
Abstract = {Context. Observations of SiO line emission in shocks in star-forming
   regions indicate that silicate dust destruction must be occurring in
   these dense regions. Current models rely on predictions for dust
   destruction by sputtering in C-type shock waves. However, J-type shocks
   may also be relevant for interpreting the widely-observed optical line
   emission from species such as OI and Fe II.
   Aims. In this work we explore, for the first time, dust destruction in
   J-type shocks slower than 50 km s(-1).
   Methods. We follow the dust trajectories throughout the shock using a
   model for the dust dynamics that allows us to solve the shock structure
   and at the same time calculate the degree of dust processing. We include
   the effects of sputtering in gas-grain collisions, and vaporisation and
   shattering in grain-grain collisions.
   Results. We find that the amount of silicon released into the gas phase
   is a few percent. The dominant destructive process is vaporisation, not
   sputtering. The degree of dust destruction increases with the shock
   velocity but decreases as the preshock density increases.
   Conclusions. Our results compare well with that of C-type shock models.
   J-type shocks are therefore reasonable candidates for an interpretation
   of SiO line emission in molecular outflows and jets.},

   late-type stars, using the 14 m radio telescope at Taeduk Radio

   1995-1996. Four of these are new detections. For the v = 2, J = 3-2

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {394},
Pages = {51-66},
Abstract = {We describe a combined dynamic atmosphere and maser propagation model of
   SiO maser emission in Mira variables. This model rectifies many of the
   defects of an earlier model of this type, particularly in relation to
   the infrared (IR) radiation field generated by dust and various
   wavelength-dependent, optically thick layers. Modelled masers form in
   rings with radii consistent with those found in very long baseline
   interferometry (VLBI) observations and with earlier models. This
   agreement requires the adoption of a radio photosphere of radius
   approximately twice that of the stellar photosphere, in agreement with
   observations. A radio photosphere of this size renders invisible certain
   maser sites with high amplification at low radii, and conceals
   high-velocity shocks, which are absent in radio continuum observations.
   The SiO masers are brightest at an optical phase of 0.1-0.25, which is
   consistent with observed phase lags. Dust can have both mild and
   profound effects on the maser emission. Maser rings, a shock and the
   optically thick layer in the SiO pumping band at 8.13 mu m appear to be
   closely associated in three out of four phase samples.},

Abstract = {Silicon monoxide (SiO) is injected directly into the Earth's upper
   atmosphere by ablating meteoroids. SiO is also produced by the reaction
   of atomic Si (another ablation product) with O(2) and O(3). The
   reactions of SiO with several atmospherically relevant oxidants have
   been studied by the pulsed laser photolysis of a Si atom precursor in
   the presence of O(2), followed by time-resolved non-resonant
   laser-induced fluorescence of SiO at 282 nm. This yielded: k(SiO + O(3),
   190-293 K) = (4.4 +/- 0.6) x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1); k(SiO +

   These results are explained by combining ab initio quantum chemistry
   calculations with transition state theory and RRKM theory. An upper
   limit of 5 x 10(-13) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) for the reaction SiO(2) +
   O -> SiO + O(2) was determined, but calculations indicate the existence
   of a high barrier (104.7 kJ mol(-1)) which will make this reaction very

Title = {SiO line emission from interstellar jets and outflows:
   silicon-containing mantles and non-stationary shock waves},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {490},
Pages = {695-U38},
Abstract = {Context. We study the production and emission of SiO and H(2) in the gas
   phase of molecular outflows, extending previous work in which we
   considered steady-state C-type shock waves and assumed the silicon to be
   present only in the cores of silicate grains.
   Aims. We place constraints on the physical parameters of the pre-shock
   region, using recent observations of SiO and observations of molecular
   hydrogen. We show the effects of introducing SiO-containing mantles and
   of varying the age of the shock wave. We consider simultaneously the
   emission of SiO and H(2) from the young L1157 outflow.
   Methods. The molecular outflows are studied by means of a code that can
   generate stationary C- and J-type shock models and approximate
   non-stationary solutions, which combine these two types of shock wave.
   The emission of molecular hydrogen is computed by this code, whereas the
   SiO emission is computed by means of a separate LVG model, which uses
   the calculated physical and chemical profiles. A grid of models has been
   computed, with shock speeds in the range 10 <= v(s) <= 35 km s(-1) and
   pre-shock gas densities 10(4) <= n(H) <= 10(6) cm(-3). A wide range of
   magnetic field strengths has been investigated, from 45 mu G to about
   600 beta G.
   Results. We illustrate our results by means of observational data
   obtained on the blue lobe of the L1157 outflow. Given the combinations
   of pre-shock densities and shock velocities necessary to fit the H(2)
   observations, we find that the erosion only of the silicate material in
   the grains cores cannot account for the observed SiO line intensities.
   We investigate the possiblity that a fraction of the SiO is present
   initially in the grain mantles, and we succeed in constraining this
   fraction. Introducing even a few percent of the silicon (as SiO) into
   the mantles is sufficient to increase the SiO line widths and fluxes by
   an order of magnitude. With this assumption, it is possible to find a
   non-stationary shock model that provides a reasonable fit of the
   observations of both H(2) and SiO.
   Conclusions. With a few percent of the silicon present initially in the
   grain mantles, good agreement is obtained with recent observations of
   SiO line integrated line intensities for a pre-shock density n(H) =
   10(4) cm(-3) and a shock speed v(s) = 20 km s(-1). The magnetic field
   strength and the shock age are not well constrained by the observations
   of either H(2) or SiO. We show that CO observations (in particular, with
   the Herschel satellite) could provide further discrimination between the
   models.},

Journal = APJ,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {681},
Pages = {1574-1583},
Abstract = {We report the first Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of v =
   1, J = 1-0 SiO masers at 43 GHz in the circumstellar envelope of the
   M-type semiregular supergiant variable star AH Sco at two epochs
   separated by 12 days in 2004 March. These high-resolution VLBA images
   reveal that the distribution of the SiO masers is roughly on a
   persistent elliptical ring, with the lengths of the major and minor axes
   being about 18.5 and 15.8 mas, respectively, along a position angle of
   150 degrees. The redshifted masers are found to be slightly closer to
   the central star than are the blueshifted masers. The line-of-sight
   velocity structure of the SiO masers shows that with respect to the
   systemic velocity of -6.8 km s(-1), the higher velocity features are
   closer to the star, which can be well explained by the simple outflow or
   infall, without rotation kinematics, of SiO masers around AH Sco. A
   study of the proper motions of 59 matched features between our two
   epochs clearly indicates that the SiO maser shell around AH Sco was
   undergoing an overall contraction toward the star at a velocity of
   approximate to 13 km s(-1) at a distance of 2.26 kpc to AH Sco. Our
   three-dimensional maser kinematics model further suggests that such an
   inward motion is very likely to be due to the gravitation of the central
   star. The distance to AH Sco of 2.26 +/- 0.19 kpc that we obtained from
   our three-dimensional kinematics model fitting is consistent with its
   kinematic distance of 2.0 kpc.},

Title = {Dust in brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets - I. Chemical composition
   and spectral appearance of quasi-static cloud layers},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {485},
Pages = {547-560},
Abstract = {Aims. Brown dwarfs are covered by dust cloud layers which cause
   inhomogeneous surface features and move below the observable tau = 1
   level during the object's evolution. The cloud layers have a strong
   influence on the structure and spectral appearance of brown dwarfs and
   extra-solar planets, e. g. by providing high local opacities and by
   removing condensable elements from the atmosphere causing a sub-solar
   metalicity in the atmosphere. We aim at understanding the formation of
   cloud layers in quasi-static substellar atmospheres that consist of
   dirty grains composed of numerous small islands of different solid
   condensates.
   Methods. The time-dependent description is a kinetic model describing
   nucleation, growth and evaporation. It is extended to treat
   gravitational settling and is applied to the static-stationary case of
   substellar model atmospheres. From the solution of the dust moments, we
   determine the grain size distribution function approximately which,
   together with the calculated material volume fractions, provides the
   basis for applying effective medium theory and Mie theory to calculate
   the opacities of the composite dust grains.
   Results. The cloud particles in brown dwarfs and hot giant-gas planets
   are found to be small in the high atmospheric layers (a approximate to
   0.01 mu m), and are composed of a rich mixture of all considered
   condensates, in particular MgSiO(3){[}s], Mg(2)SiO(4){[}s] and
   SiO(2){[}s]. As the particles settle downward, they increase in size and
   reach several 100 mu m in the deepest layers. The more volatile parts of
   the grains evaporate and the particles stepwise purify to form composite
   particles of high-temperature condensates in the deeper layers, mainly
   made of Fe{[}s] and Al(2)O(3){[}s]. The gas phase abundances of the
   elements involved in the dust formation process vary by orders of
   magnitudes throughout the atmosphere. The grain size distribution is
   found to be relatively broad in the upper atmospheric layers but
   strongly peaked in the deeper layers. This reflects the cessation of the
   nucleation process at intermediate heights. The spectral appearance of
   the cloud layers in the mid IR (7-20 mu m) is close to a grey body with
   only weak broad features of a few percent, mainly caused by
   MgSiO(3){[}s], and Mg(2)SiO(4){[}s]. These features are, nevertheless, a
   fingerprint of the dust in the higher atmospheric layers that can be
   probed by observations.
   Conclusions. Our models predict that the gas phase depletion is much
   weaker than phase-equilibrium calculations in the high atmospheric
   layers. Because of the low densities, the dust formation process is
   incomplete there, which results in considerable amounts of left-over
   elements that might produce stronger and broader neutral metallic lines.},

Abstract = {The v = 0, 1, 2, and 3, J = 1-0 SiO maser spectra of R Cassiopeia have
   been observed with high phase resolution over a time span of
   approximately 2.6 stellar periods. A time lag cross-correlation analysis
   has been performed on the entire data set and on two subsets of the
   data. The analysis indicates that the variations in the emission of the
   v = 1 and 2 states were most highly correlated at lag zero during the
   entire period of observation. During one complete cycle of the star, the
   v = 0, J = 1-0 emission was most highly correlated with the v = 1 and 2
   at a lag of -1, indicating that the v = 0 emission varied in advance of
   the excited vibrational state emission. The lags represented 0.1
   pulsation periods of the star, or a 43 day time period for these
   analyses. During a second cycle of the star the v = 0 and v = 2
   emissions did not exhibit a maximum near the phase of 0.2 and were not
   highly correlated with the v = 1 emission. The lags represented 0.05
   periods of the star for this analysis. The v = 0 emission generally had
   relatively low contrast between its maximum and minimum and had several
   relative maxima during a stellar period. The v = 3 emission was observed
   to occur at various phases of the star. These observations further

Journal = AA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {482},
Pages = {809-829},
Abstract = {We study the production of SiO in the gas phase of molecular outflows,
   through the sputtering of Si-bearing material in refractory grain cores,
   which are taken to be olivine. We calculate also the rotational line
   spectrum of the SiO. The sputtering is driven by neutral particle impact
   on charged grains, in steady-state C-type shock waves, at the speed of
   ambipolar diffusion. The emission of the SiO molecule is calculated by
   means of an LVG code. A grid of models, with shock speeds in the range
   20 < v(s) < 50 km s(-1) and preshock gas densities 104 < n(H) < 106
   cm(-3), has been generated. We compare our results with those of an
   earlier study ( Schilke et al. 1997). Improvements in the treatment of
   the coupling between the charged grains and the neutral fluid lead to
   narrower shock waves and lower fractions of Si (less than or similar to
   10\%) being released into the gas phase. Erosion of grain cores is
   significant (greater than or similar to 1\%) only for C-type shock
   speeds v(s) > 25 km s(-1), given the adopted properties of olivine. More
   realistic assumptions concerning the initial fractional abundance of
   O(2) lead to SiO formation being delayed, so that it occurs in the cool,
   dense postshock flow. Good agreement is obtained with recent
   observations of SiO line intensities in the L1157 and L1448 molecular
   outflows. The inferred temperature, opacity, and SiO column density in
   the emission region differ significantly from those estimated by means
   of LVG ``slab{''} models. The fractional abundance of SiO is deduced and
   found to be in the range 4 x 10(-8) less than or similar to n( SiO)/n(H)
   less than or similar to 3 x 10(-7). Observed line profiles are wider
   than predicted and imply multiple, unresolved shock regions within the

Abstract = {Oxidation reaction of the ground state Si atom was studied by using a
   crossed molecular beam technique at 13.0 kJ/moI of collision energy. The
   Si atomic beam was generated by laser vaporization and crossed with the
   oxygen molecular beam at right angle. Products at the crossing region
   were detected by the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The LIF of SiO(A
   (1)Pi-X (1)Sigma(+)) was used to determine the vibrational state
   distribution of the electronic ground state, SiO(X (1)Sigma(+)). The
   determined distribution was inverted with the maximum population at
   upsilon `'=4, and in good agreement with the recent quasiclassical
   trajectory calculation on the singlet potential energy surface. The
   agreement suggested that an abstraction mechanism is dominant at the
   collision energy studied here. One of the counterproducts, O((3)p(J)),
   Was also observed by the vacuum ultraviolet LIF and the distribution of
   the spin-orbit levels were determined. The formation of O((3)P(J)) was
   consistent with the significant population of upsilon `'=7 and 8 states
   of SiO, which could be explained by the presence of the triplet product
   channel with higher exothermicity. (c) 2008 American Institute of

   1-0 and nu = 2 J = 1-0 from the symbiotic stellar system R Aquarii,
   which hosts an evolved AGB star plus a hot companion. Observations were
   performed at two epochs: 2004.98 and 2005.98. Accurate absolute
   coordinates and proper motions of the emission centroid were obtained;
   the errors expected for these parameters are also given. We compare the
   VERA data with the previous astrometry by Hipparcos. This represents a
   possibility to improve the orbital parameters of the system in a
   different way than that done before. Thanks to our accurate astrometry,
   we have also estimated the percentage of spot coincidences between both
   maser transitions, a parameter that has been proposed to be relevant to
   discriminate between different maser pumping schemes. Although the
   overall distributions of both lines are always similar, the spots are
   rarely coincident, in a percentage ranging between 3\% and 20\% of the
   cases. The lack of systematic coincidence favors, in principle,
   radiative pumping. However, we argue that no firm conclusion can be
   reached due to a lack of models that include an overlap of rovibrational
   lines, and that accurately address the coincidence of very intense spots
   of different maser transitions.},

   Leonis Minoris Using VERA},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are intense emitters of
   SiO and H(2)O maser lines at 43 (J = 1 -> 0, nu = 1 and 2) and 22 GHz,
   respectively. VLBI observations of the maser emission provide a unique
   tool to sample the innermost layers of the circumstellar envelopes in
   AGB stars. Nevertheless, the difficulties in achieving astrometrically
   aligned nu = 1 and nu = 2 SiO maser maps have traditionally prevented a
   unique interpretation of the observations in terms of the physical
   underlying conditions, which depend on the nature of the SiO pumping
   mechanism. We have carried out observations of the SiO and H(2)O maser
   emission towards R LMi, using the astro-metric capabilities of VERA. Due
   to the too weak emission of the reference calibrator, we had to develop
   a special method to accurately relate the coordinates for both
   transitions. We present relative astrometrically aligned nu = 1 and nu =
   2 J = 1 -> 0 SiO maser Maps, at multiple epochs, and discuss the
   astrophysical results. The incorporation of astrometric information into
   the maps of SiO masers challenges the weak points in the current
   theoretical models, which will need further refinements to address the
   observation results.},

Title = {Variable Asymmetry of the Circumstellar Envelope in IK Tauri Traced by
   SiO Maser Emission},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {1039-1050},
Abstract = {We observed the SiO (nu = 1 and nu = 2, J = 1-0) maser emissions toward
   the Mira variable IK Tauri (IK Tau, NML Tau, IRC + 1.0050) over nine
   epochs from 2003 November to 2005 April using the VLBI Exploration of
   Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescope array. We found that the SiO maser
   distributions around IK Tau are highly variable, depending on the
   stellar pulsation phase. The velocity structures were complex and also
   time-variable, and are inconsistent with a simply rotating shell that
   was suggested by previous observations. Based on fittings of the SiO
   maser distributions to elliptical ring models, we found that the ring
   size seems to vary in correlation with the pulsation phase, as
   previously found for TX Cam. Comparisons of the nu = 1 and nu = 2 maser
   distributions reveal that 42-50\% of the maser pairs have a positional
   offset less than 0.5 mas, suggesting that the maser pumping in these
   spots is likely to be dominated by line overlapping or collisional
   pumping, rather than pure radiative pumping. In order to model the,
   velocity structure of the spoke-like features observed in IK Tau, we
   propose a ballistic-orbit model, in which a gas clump ejected from the
   stellar surface moves radially outward with a gravitational
   deceleration, and argue that the stellar mass can be deduced from that
   model.},

Abstract = {We present results of phase-referencing VLBI observations of SiO masers
   in the Orion-KL region made with VERA. Using a strong maser spot in the
   43 GHz nu = 2 J = 1-0 emission, we derived the trigonometric parallax of
   Orion-KL to be 2.39 +/- 0.03mas, corresponding to a distance of 418 +/-
   6pc, with the highest accuracy among existing parallax measurements of

   = 1-0 maser features in Orion-KL based on absolute positions obtained
   from the phase-referencing astrometry with a common reference source.
   The maser features of both transitions show similar X-hapecl
   distributions centered at Source I. However, in each of the four arms of
   the X-shape, the SiO nu = 2 features tend to lie closer to Source I than
   the SiO nu = 1 features. The radial velocities of the maser emission
   decrease with the distance from Source I. The spatial and radial
   velocity distributions of the SiO masers suggest that the SiO masers lie
   in the rotating materials associated with a disk around Source 1, rather
   than a decelerating outflow.},

Pages = {853-863},
Abstract = {We present the results of observations of the SiO masers at 7 mm
   wavelength in several oxygen rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars.
   These observations were coordinated with observations using the ESO
   VLTI/ MIDI interferometer at 10 mu m wavelength. These stars are o Ceti
   (Mira), U Herculis (U Her), OH26.5+0.6, R Leonis (R Leo), and W Hydrae
   (W Hya). Both total intensity and linear polarizations are imaged.
   Linear radial features seen in o Ceti may be associated with an X-ray
   flare seen a year earlier by Karovska et al. (2005). Similar linear
   features are also seen in R Leo, U Her and OH26.5+0.6. These features
   typically show systematic radial velocity variations and a tendency for
   the linear polarization to be perpendicular to the direction of
   elongation, suggesting that magnetic fields are dynamically important. A
   wide radial extent of the maser rings observed in U Herculis and
   OH26.5+0.6 is interpreted as meaning that the outer boundaries of the

Journal = APJ,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {669},
Pages = {446-458},
Abstract = {We present the results of SiO millimeter line observations of a sample
   of known SiO maser sources covering a wide dust temperature range. A
   cold part of the sample was selected from the SiO maser sources found in
   our recent SiO maser survey of cold dusty objects. The aim of the
   present research is to investigate the causes of the correlation between
   infrared colors and SiO maser intensity ratios among different
   transition lines. In particular, the correlation between infrared colors
   and SiO maser intensity ratio among the J = 1-0 v = 1, 2, and 3 lines
   are our main concern in this paper. We observed in total 75 SiO maser
   sources with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope quasi-simultaneously in the SiO
   J = 1-0 v = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and J = 2-1 v = 1, 2 lines. We also observed
   the sample in the (SiO)-Si-29 J = 1-0 v = 0 and J = 2-1 v = 0 lines,
   (SiO)-Si-30 J = 1-0 v = 0 line, and the H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) line. As
   reported in previous papers, we confirmed that the intensity ratios of
   the SiO J = 1-0 v = 2 to v = 1 lines clearly correlate with infrared
   colors. In addition, we found possible correlation between infrared
   colors and the intensity ratios of the SiO J 1 0 v 3 to v = 1 and 2
   lines. Two overlap lines of H2O (i.e., 11(6,6) nu(2) = 1 -> 12(7,5)
   nu(2) = 0 and 5(0,5) nu(2) = 2 -> 6(3,4) nu(2) = 1) might explain this
   correlation if these overlap lines become stronger with an increase of
   infrared colors, although the phenomena also might be explained in more
   fundamental ways if we take into account the variation of opacity from
   object to object.},

Abstract = {Using the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mu m images with 1.2 `' pixel

   18 very red objects, which are extremely faint in the near-infrared

   a high-extinction layer of more than a few tenths of a solar mass in
   front of the central star. Furthermore, radio observations in the SiO
   and H2O maser lines found characteristic maser-line spectra of the
   embedded objects, e. g., the SiO J=1-0 line intensity in the v=2 state
   is stronger than that of the v=1 state, or very widespread H2O maser
   emission spectra. These facts indicate that these objects are really
   enshrouded by very thick circumstellar matter, some of which cannot be
   ascribed to the AGB wind of the central star. Individually interesting
   objects are discussed, including two newly found water fountains and an
   SiO source accompanying a nebulosity.},

Title = {The Mira variable S Orionis: relationships between the photosphere,
   molecular layer, dust shell, and SiO maser shell at 4 epochs},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {470},
Pages = {191-210},
Abstract = {Aims. We present the first multi-epoch study that includes concurrent
   mid-infrared and radio interferometry of an oxygen-rich Mira star.
   Methods. We obtained mid-infrared interferometry of S Ori with VLTI/MIDI
   at four epochs in December 2004, February/March 2005, November 2005, and
   December 2005. We concurrently observed v = 1, J = 1-0 (43.1 GHz), and v
   = 2, J = 1-0 (42.8 GHz) SiO maser emission toward S Ori with the VLBA in
   January, February, and November 2005. The MIDI data are analyzed using
   self-excited dynamic model atmospheres including molecular layers,
   complemented by a radiative transfer model of the circumstellar dust
   shell. The VLBA data are reduced to the spatial structure and kinematics
   of the maser spots.
   Results. The modeling of our MIDI data results in phase-dependent
   continuum photospheric angular diameters of 9.0 +/- 0.3 mas (phase
   0.42), 7.9 +/- 0.1 mas (0.55), 9.7 +/- 0.1 mas (1.16), and 9.5 +/- 0.4
   mas (1.27). The dust shell can best be modeled with Al2O3 grains using
   phase-dependent inner boundary radii between 1.8 and 2.4 photospheric
   radii. The dust shell appears to be more compact with greater optical
   depth near visual minimum (tau(V) similar to 2.5), and more extended
   with lower optical depth after visual maximum (tau(V) similar to 1.5).
   The ratios of the 43.1 GHz/42.8 GHz SiO maser ring radii to the
   photospheric radii are 2.2 +/- 0.3/2.1 +/- 0.2 (phase 0.44), 2.4 +/-
   0.3/2.3 +/- 0.4 (0.55), and 2.1 +/- 0.3/1.9 +/- 0.2 (1.15). The maser
   spots mark the region of the molecular atmospheric layers just beyond
   the steepest decrease in the mid-infrared model intensity profile. Their
   velocity structure indicates a radial gas expansion.
   Conclusions. S Ori shows significant phase-dependences of photospheric
   radii and dust shell parameters. Al2O3 dust grains and SiO maser spots
   form at relatively small radii of similar to 1.8-2.4 photospheric radii.
   Our results suggest increased mass loss and dust formation close to the
   surface near the minimum visual phase, when Al2O3 dust grains are
   co-located with the molecular gas and the SiO maser shells, and a more
   expanded dust shell after visual maximum. Silicon does not appear to be
   bound in dust, as our data show no sign of silicate grains.},

Title = {Mapping the circumstellar SiO maser emission in R Leonis},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {468},
Pages = {L1-L4},
Abstract = {Context. The study of the innermost circumstellar layers around AGB
   stars is crucial for understanding how these envelopes are formed and
   evolve. The SiO maser emission occurs at a few stellar radii from the
   central star, providing direct information on the stellar pulsation and
   on the chemical and physical properties of these regions. Our data also
   shed light on several aspects of the SiO maser-pumping theory that are
   not yet well understood.
   Aims. We aim to determine the relative spatial distribution of the 43
   GHz and 86 GHz SiO maser lines in the oxygen-rich evolved star R Leo.
   Methods. We imaged the 43 GHz ((SiO)-Si-28 v=1, 2 J=1-0 and (SiO)-Si-29
   v=0 J=1-0) and 86 GHz ((SiO)-Si-28 v=1 J=2-1 and (SiO)-Si-29 v=0 J=2-1)
   masing regions with milliarcsecond resolution, by means of very long
   baseline interferometry.
   Results. We confirm previous results obtained in other oxygen-rich
   envelopes. In particular, when comparing the 43 GHz emitting regions,
   the (SiO)-Si-28 v=2 J=1-0 transition is produced in an inner layer,
   slightly closer to the central star than the v=1 J=1-0. On the other
   hand, the 86 GHz (SiO)-Si-28 v=1 J=2-1 line arises clearly in a farther
   shell. We have also mapped the (SiO)-Si-29 v=0 J=1-0 emission in R Leo
   for the first time. The already reported discrepancy between the
   observed distributions of the different maser lines and the theoretical
   predictions is also found in R Leo.},

Title = {Rotational excitation of SiO by collisions with helium},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {459},
Pages = {297-305},
Abstract = {Context. Within shocked regions of the interstellar medium and
   circumstellar environment of AGB stars the proper modelling of SiO line
   emission through non-LTE radiative transfer calculations requires
   accurate values of collisional rate coefficients.
   Aims. The present study focuses on the transitions among the rotational
   levels of the SiO molecule in its ground vibrational state induced by
   collision with He. The H-2 molecule being the main colliding partner for
   the astrophysical regions of interest, the collisional process between
   SiO and para-H-2(j=0) is also investigated in an approximated way.
   Methods. A new 2D SiO-He potential energy surface is computed by means
   of highly correlated ab initio calculations. Collisional rate
   coefficients corresponding to the pure rotational (de) excitation of SiO
   by collision with He are obtained from close-coupling quantum scattering
   calculations of inelastic cross sections. The SiO-He potential energy
   surface is also employed to compute rate coefficients for the rotational
   (de) excitation of SiO by collision with para-H-2(j=0).
   Results. Rate coefficients for rotational levels up to j = 26 and
   kinetic temperatures in the range 10-300 K are obtained for the SiO-He
   colliding system. The large asymmetry of the SiO-He potential energy
   surface induces a propensity rule that favours odd. j transitions over
   even Delta j. The estimated values of the SiO-para-H-2(j= 0) rate
   coefficients are compared with those of Turner et al. ( 1992) for the
   twenty first rotational levels. As a result of significant differences
   between the SiO-He interaction potentials employed in the two studies,
   the rate coefficients are found to differ by a factor 2.5-5 for the main
   rotational transitions, whatever the temperature range.},

Abstract = {The mechanisms of SiO ablation have been investigated at laser
   wavelengths in the infrared, at 10.53 mu m, and in the ultraviolet at
   248 nm. The energy content of the SiO molecule in the plume and the
   occurrence of phase transformations in the target, are studied as a
   function of wavelength and fluence of the ablation laser. At 10.53 mu m,
   in the range of fluences of 0.6-3.0 J cm(-2), time distributions of
   ejected SiO, measured at different distances above the surface target
   are characteristic of thermal ablation, yielding estimated temperatures
   of the surface in the range from 1300 to 4800 K. The energy channelled
   as rotational excitation of ejected SiO, scales with increasing fluence.
   The time distributions of SiO in the plume, obtained at 248 nm laser
   ablation, are measured at different distances above the target, yielding
   velocity and energy distributions that shift towards higher values with
   distance and show a weak tendency to decrease with increasing laser
   fluence. Raman analysis of the postablated SiO targets irradiated at
   10.53 mu m, at fluences above 0.6 J cm(-2), shows the formation of Si
   nanocrystals whose size increases with fluence. Phase transformation is
   not observed at the shorter laser ablation wavelength.},

   in the infrared spectra of the secondary and tertiary standard
   calibration stars},
Journal = AJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {1445-1463},
Abstract = {We have increased the spectral resolution and accuracy of the absolute
   infrared spectral flux for a subset of stellar standards created by
   Cohen and his collaborators in previous papers in this series. We
   combined the moderate-resolution (lambda/Delta lambda similar to 400)
   spectroscopy obtained on infrared standard stars by the Short Wavelength
   Spectrometer on the Infrared Space Observatory with high-quality
   photometry that is tied to our recent absolute calibration from the
   Midcourse Space Experiment. New spectra were created for 33 stars, 9 of
   which are Cohen et al. secondary standards and another 20 of which are
   tertiary standards for which Cohen adopted spectral templates. The
   effective temperatures and angular diameters for the stars are derived
   from the absolute spectra and compare favorably with independent
   measures of these quantities in the literature. The present spectra
   display systematic differences with those of Cohen and colleagues in
   that they have 4\% - 7\% lower fluxes in the 1 - 4 mu m spectral region.
   Our spectra remove the A - K star calibration bias recently noted in the
   calibration of the Spitzer Space Telescope camera.},

Abstract = {The dipole moment functions of the titled molecules are written as the

   contributions have opposite signs over a large range of internuclear

   responsible for its small dipole moment. The dipole moment of CS is
   0.770ea(0), rather large for a diatomic in which the two atoms have
   essentially the same electronegativities; this is because for CS, the
   two components of the dipole moment have the same sign at equilibrium

Pages = {406-409},
Abstract = {The v = 0, 1, and 2, J = 1-0 SiO maser spectra of Mira have been
   observed with high phase resolution over approximately three periods of
   the star. A time lag cross-correlation analysis of the integrated flux
   density and the velocity centroid of the emission indicates that the
   velocity structure varies in a consistent manner with emission during
   some oscillation periods of the star. Over two periods of the star the v
   = 1 integrated flux density and velocity centroid were correlated at the
   0.67 level. The velocity centroid reached a maximum 0.066 phase earlier
   than the integrated flux density. These quantities were anticorrelated
   at the 0.71 level, with the velocity centroid reaching a minimum 0.59
   phase earlier than the integrated flux density maximum. The other maser
   transitions show lower levels of correlation and other phase
   relationships. The velocity centroids of the spectra have been analyzed
   and compared with theoretical predictions of shock passage effects.
   These observations are relevant for kinematic models of the maser region
   and for maser-pumping models.},

   3-14\% with time but show no clear correlation with pulsation phase. In
   all cases, the SiO masers appear just outside the dense molecular layer

Volume = {132},
Pages = {1046-1051},
Abstract = {The v = 1, J = 1-0 silicon monoxide maser emission from 85 stars was
   resurveyed in 2005 and 2006. The emission from these stars had
   previously been measured in 1979 and/or 1983. For the detected stars the
   velocity centroids were determined and compared with the previous
   values. If supergiant stars, known binary stars, and S Virginis were
   removed from the data set, 76 sources remained. Seven of these sources
   were not of sufficient flux density to be claimed as detections. The
   mean difference in the velocity centroids of the remaining sources was
   0.065 km s(-1), and the standard deviation was 2.00 km s(-1). It is
   important to determine the standard deviation of SiO maser time
   variations in order to identify the level of the time variability of the
   sources, possible binary stars, unusual emission patterns, or perhaps
   planets. The velocity centroid of S Virginis differed by 13.5 km s(-1)
   from its 1983 value. This difference indicates that S Virginis is
   probably part of a multiple-star system. A naive analysis of the present
   data combined with earlier published observations indicates a revolution

Journal = AA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {454},
Pages = {221-231},
Abstract = {Aims. We present mm line and continuum observations at high spatial
   resolution characterizing the physical and chemical properties of the
   young massive star-forming region IRAS 18182-1433.
   Methods. The region was observed with the Submillimeter Array in the
   1.3mm band. The data are complemented with short-spacing information
   from single-dish CO(2-1) observations. SiO(1-0) data from the VLA are
   added to the analysis.
   Results. Multiple massive outflows emanate from the mm continuum peak.
   The CO(2-1) data reveal a quadrupolar outflow system consisting of two
   outflows inclined by similar to 90 degrees. One outflow exhibits a
   cone-like red-shifted morphology with a jet-like blue-shifted
   counterpart where a blue counter-cone can only be tentatively
   identified. The SiO(1-0) data suggest the presence of a third outflow.
   Analyzing the (12)CO/(13)CO line ratios indicates decreasing CO line
   opacities with increasing velocities. Although we observe a multiple
   outflow system, the mm continuum peak remains single-peaked at the given
   spatial resolution (similar to 13500AU). The other seven detected
   molecular species -also high-density tracers like CH(3)CN, CH(3)OH,
   HCOOCH(3)-are all similar to 1-2 `' offset from the mm continuum peak,
   but spatially associated with a strong molecular outflow peak and a cm
   emission feature indicative of a thermal jet. This spatial displacement
   between the molecular lines and the mm continuum emission could be
   either due to an unresolved sub-source at the position of the cm
   feature, or the outflow/jet itself alters the chemistry of the core
   enhancing the molecular abundances toward that region. A temperature
   estimate based on the CH(3)CN(12(k)-11(k)) lines suggests temperatures
   of the order of 150K. A velocity analysis of the high-density tracing
   molecules reveals that at the given spatial resolution none of them
   shows any coherent velocity structure which would be consistent with a
   rotating disk. We discuss this lack of rotation signatures and attribute
   it to intrinsic difficulties to observationally isolate massive
   accretion disks from the surrounding dense gas envelopes and the
   molecular outflows.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {454},
Pages = {247-255},
Abstract = {Aims. New SiO multi-transition millimetre line observations of a sample
   of carbon stars, including J = 8 -> 7 observations with the APEX
   telescope, are used to probe the role of non-equilibrium chemistry and
   the influence of grains in circumstellar envelopes of carbon stars.
   Methods. A detailed radiative transfer modelling, including the effect
   of dust emission in the excitation analysis, of the observed SiO line
   emission is performed. A combination of low- and high-energy lines are
   important in constraining the abundance distribution.
   Results. It is found that the fractional abundance of SiO in these
   C-rich environments can be several orders of magnitude higher than
   predicted by equilibrium stellar atmosphere chemistry. In fact, the SiO
   abundance distribution of carbon stars closely mimic that of M-type
   (O-rich) AGB stars. A possible explanation for this behaviour is a
   shock-induced chemistry, but also the influence of dust grains, both as
   a source for depletion as well as production of SiO, needs to be further
   investigated. As observed for M-type AGB stars, a clear trend that the
   SiO fractional abundance decreases as the mass-loss rate of the star
   increases is found for the carbon stars. This indicates that SiO is
   accreted onto dust grains in the circumstellar envelopes.},

Title = {Time monitoring observations of SiO J=2-1 and J=3-2 maser emission
   toward late-type stars},
Journal = APJS,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {360-385},
Abstract = {We present the results of simultaneous time monitoring observations of
   SiO J=2-1 and J=3-2 maser emission for 10 late-type stars (8 Mira
   variables, 1 OH/IR star, and 1 supergiant) with the 14 m radio telescope
   at Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory from 1999 January to 2001
   February. The SiO v=1, J=2-1 and J=3-2 maser emission was detected at
   almost all observational epochs. The SiO v=2, J=2-1 maser was detected
   from 4 late-type stars (VY CMa, R Cas, chi Cyg, R Leo) and the v=2,
   J=3-2 maser was detected from 7 stars (R Aqr, TX Cam, R Cas, chi Cyg, W
   Hya, R Leo, IK Tau). The v=3, J=2-1 and J=3-2 masers were also detected
   from chi Cyg and TX Cam, respectively. Based on these observational
   data, line profile and peak velocity variations with respect to stellar
   velocity, antenna temperatures, and their ratio variations as a function
   of optical phase of central star were investigated. As main results, the
   line profile and the peak velocity variation of the v=1, J=3-2 maser
   with pulsation phase was found to differ from the v=1, J=2-1 transition.
   Similarly, the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions also differ between
   rovibrational transitions at a given pulsation phase. However, it is
   difficult to find significant correlations between the peak velocity
   variation relative to the stellar velocity of either the J=3-2 or J=2-1
   transitions over pulsation phase, due to limited time sampling in these
   data. The peak and integrated antenna temperature (PT and IT) ratios
   among rotational ladders and vibrational states are investigated. These
   ratios between rotational ladders of the v=1, J=2-1, and J=3-2 masers
   are averaged to be the peak antenna temperature ratio, PT(v=1,
   J=3-2)/PT(v=1, J=2-1)approximate to 0.29, and the integrated antenna
   temperature ratio, IT(v=1, J=3-2)/IT(v=1, J=2-1)approximate to 0.21,
   respectively. In the v=2 state, these ratios are PT(v=2, J=3-2)=PT(v=2,
   J=2-1)approximate to 7.94 and IT(v=2, J=3-2)/IT(v=2, J=2-1)approximate
   to 8.50, respectively. The peak and integrated antenna temperature
   ratios between vibrational states are also averaged to be PT(v=2,
   J=3-2)/PT(v=1, J=3-2)approximate to 1.29, IT(v=2, J=3-2)/IT(v=1,
   J=3-2)approximate to 1.02, PT(v=2, J=2-1)/PT(v=1, J=2-1)approximate to
   0.06, and IT(v=2, J=2-1)/IT(v=1, J=2-1)approximate to 0: 05,
   respectively. These intensity ratios for the v=2, J=2-1 and v=2, J=3-2
   masers suggest that line overlaps operating in the v=2, J=2-1 transition
   do not similarly affect the v=2, J=3-2 transition.},

Pages = {982-994},
Abstract = {We report Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 43 GHz upsilon
   = 1, J = 1-0 SiO masers in the circumstellar envelope of the M-type
   semiregular variable star VX Sgr at three epochs during 1999 April-May.
   These high-resolution VLBA images reveal a persistent ringlike
   distribution of SiO masers with a projected radius of approximate to 3
   stellar radii. The typical angular size of 0.5 mas for individual maser
   features was estimated from two-point correlation function analysis of
   maser spots. We found that the apparent size scale of maser features was
   distinctly smaller than that observed in the previous observations by
   comparing their fractions of the total power imaged. This change in the
   size scale of maser emission may be related to stellar activity that
   caused a large SiO flare during our observations. Our observations
   confirmed the asymmetric distribution of maser emission, but the overall
   morphology has changed significantly, with the majority of the masers
   clustering to the northeast of the star compared to the majority of the
   masers lying in the southwest in 1992. By identifying 42 matched maser
   features appearing in all three epochs, we determined the contraction of
   an SiO maser shell toward VX Sgr at a proper motion of -0.507 +/- 0.069
   mas yr(-1), corresponding to a velocity of about 4 km s(-1) at a
   distance of 1.7 kpc to VX Sgr. Such a velocity is on the order of the
   sound speed and can be easily explained by the gravitational infall of
   material from the circumstellar dust shell.},

Title = {Modeling of the SiO circumstellar maser: Rate coefficients for the
   vibrationally-rotationally inelastic scattering of H+SiO},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {639},
Pages = {204-209},
Abstract = {Rate coefficients for inelastic collisions of H atoms with SiO molecules
   are presented over a wide range of temperatures. These coefficients are
   needed in the modeling of the observed SiO maser radiation that
   originates from circumstellar environments. The rate coefficients have
   been computed theoretically. They are based initially on ab initio
   calculation of the H-SiO interaction potential. This is followed by an
   approximate quantum scattering calculation, using the vibrationally
   close-coupling infinite-order sudden method, of the
   vibrationally-rotationally inelastic scattering cross sections over a
   relatively large range of scattering energies. The rate coefficients
   presented here are finally computed by suitably averaging the cross
   sections over an equilibrium Boltzmann distribution of relative
   translational energies. The paper discusses the general form and
   properties of the rate constants and provides a computer code to compute
   any desired vibrational-rotational inelastic rate constant for
   vibrational quantum number v 0 to 5 and rotational quantum number j = 0
   to 40. The computer code will return rate constants for any desired
   temperature, and the computed rate constants should be reliable in the
   important temperature range 100-5500 K. The quantum mechanically
   computed cross section data extend up to a temperature of 9600 K, which
   means that computed rate constants above about 5500 K become
   progressively less reliable with increasing temperature, as they depend
   to a greater extent on extrapolated data.},

Abstract = {We present the first high-resolution (5.'' 6 x 5.'' 1) images of the
   emission of silicon monoxide (SiO) in the nucleus of the nearby spiral
   IC 342, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI).
   Using a two-field mosaic, we have simultaneously mapped the emission of
   the SiO(v = 0, J = 2- 1) and (HCO+)-C-13(J = 1- 0) lines in a region of
   similar to 0.9 kpc x 1.3 kpc (RA x Dec) centered around the nucleus of
   IC 342. The bulk of the emission in the two lines comes from a similar
   to 290 pc spiral arm located to the North and a central component that
   forms the southern ridge of a r similar to 80 pc nuclear ring that was
   identified in other interferometer maps of the galaxy. We detect
   continuum emission at 86.8 GHz in a similar to 80-180 pc central source.
   The continuum emission, dominated by thermal free-free bremsstrahlung,
   is mostly anticorrelated with the observed distribution of SiO clouds.
   The SiO-to- (HCO+)-C-13 intensity ratio is seen to increase by an order
   of magnitude from the nuclear ring (similar to 0.3) to the spiral arm
   (similar to 3.3). Furthermore the gas kinematics show significant
   differences between SiO and (HCO+)-C-13 over the spiral arm, where the
   linewidths of SiO are a factor of 2 larger than those of (HCO+)-C-13.
   The average abundance of SiO in the inner r similar to 320 pc of IC 342
   is X(SiO) greater than or similar to 2 x 10(-10). This shows that shock
   chemistry is at work in the inner molecular gas reservoir of IC 342.
   To shed light on the nature of shocks in IC 342, we have compared the
   emission of SiO with another tracer of molecular shocks: the emission of
   methanol (CH3OH). We find that the significant difference of the
   abundance of SiO measured between the spiral arm (X(SiO) similar to a
   few 10(-9)) and the nuclear ring (X(SiO) similar to 10(-10)) is not
   echoed by a comparable variation in the SiO-to-CH3OH intensity ratio.
   This implies that the typical shock velocities should be similar in the
   two regions. In contrast, the fraction of shocked molecular gas should
   be similar to 5-7 times larger in the spiral arm (up to similar to 10\%
   of the available molecular gas mass over the arm region) compared to the
   nuclear ring. In the light of these results, we revise the validity of
   the various scenarios that have been proposed to explain the onset of
   shock chemistry in galaxies and study their applicability to the nucleus
   of IC 342. We conclude that the large-scale shocks revealed by the SiO
   map of IC 342 are mostly unrelated to star formation and arise instead
   in a pre-starburst phase. Shocks are driven by cloud-cloud collisions
   along the potential well of the IC 342 bar. The general implications for
   the current understanding of galaxy evolution are discussed.},

Abstract = {The v = 0, 1, 2, and 3, J = 1 - 0 SiO maser spectra of Mira have been
   observed with high phase resolution v over approximately 2.6 periods of
   the star. These observations represent the first reported monitoring of
   the v = 0 emission over multiple stellar periods. A time cross-
   correlation analysis indicates that the variations in the emission of
   the v = 1 and v = 0 states were coincident to 0.066 or less of a phase
   period. The variations of v v the v = 1 and v = 2 emissions were
   coincident to less than 0.033 of a phase period. The v = 0 emission
   generally had relatively low contrast between its maximum and minimum
   and had several relative maxima during a stellar period. The relative
   minima varied by vibrational state. The v = 3 emission was only observed
   once during these v observations, at a time when the v = 2 emission was
   near its absolute maximum. These observations further v constrain
   possible models of maser pumping.},

Title = {SiO maser survey of the inner bar of the galactic bulge},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {529-561},
Abstract = {We surveyed 291 MSX/2MASS infrared objects in the 7 degrees x 2 degrees
   area of the galactic center in the 43 GHz SiO J = 1-0 v = I and 2 maser
   lines, obtaining accurate radial velocities of 163 detected objects. The
   surveyed area is the region where the IRAS catalog is incomplete due to
   contamination by high source density. The objects in the present
   MSX/2MASS sample were chosen to have similar infrared characteristics to
   those of the previous SiO maser-survey samples based on the
   color-selected IRAS sources. The sampling based on the 2MASS catalog
   causes a bias to the foreside objects of the bulge due to heavy
   obscuration by interstellar dust; the detections considerably leaned on
   the V-lsr < 0 side. The l-V diagram reveals two conspicuous features,
   which were not present or tenuous in the previous studies: one feature
   indicating a linear velocity increase with longitude with I I I <
   1.degrees 5, which is likely to be associated with the inner bar, and
   the other feature having considerably eccentric velocities, more than
   those of the normal x(1)-orbit family feature. The extinction-corrected
   K magnitudes (if used as a distance modulus) tend to show a sequential
   deposition of these objects along the line of sight toward the galactic
   center, depending on their radial velocities. The tendency that appeared
   in the distance measures is consistent with the bulge-bar dynamical
   model utilizing the periodic orbit families in the bar potential.},

Title = {Mira variables in the OGLE bulge fields},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {443},
Pages = {143-U96},
Abstract = {The 222 000 I-band light curves of variable stars detected by the
   OGLE-II survey in the direction of the Galactic Bulge have been fitted
   and also correlated with the DENIS and 2MASS all-sky release databases
   and with lists of known objects. Lightcurves and the results of the
   lightcurve fitting ( periods and amplitudes) and DENIS and 2MASS data
   are presented for 2691 objects with I-band semi-amplitude larger than
   0.45 mag, corresponding to classical Mira variables. That the Mira
   period distribution of 6 fields at similar longitude but spanning
   latitudes from - 1.2 to - 5.8 are statistically indistinguishable
   indicates similar populations with initial masses of 1.5-2 M-.,
   corresponding to ages of 1-3 Gyr. A field at similar longitude at b = -
   0.05 from Glass et al. (2001, MNRAS, 321, 77; erratum: 2002, MNRAS, 336,
   1390) does show a significantly different period distribution,
   indicating the presence of a younger population of 2.5- 3 M-. and ages
   below 1 Gyr. The K-band period-luminosity relation is presented for the
   whole sample and for sub-fields. The zero point depends on Galactic
   longitude. Simulations are carried out to show that the observed
   dependence of the zero point with l, and the number of stars per field
   are naturally explained using the model of disk and bulge stars of
   Binney et al. ( 1997, MNRAS, 288, 365), for a viewing angle (major-axis
   Bar - axis perpendicular to the line-of-sight to the Galactic Centre) of
   43 +/- 17 degrees. The simulations also show that biases in the observed
   zero point are small, < 0.02 mag. A comparison is made with similar
   objects in the Magellanic Clouds. The slope of the PL-relation in the
   Bulge and the MCs agree within the errorbars. Assuming the zero point
   does not depend on metallicity, a distance modulus difference of 3.72
   between Bulge and LMC is derived. This implies a LMC DM of 18.21 for an
   assumed distance to the Galactic Centre ( GC) of 7.9 kpc, or, assuming a
   LMC DM of 18.50, a distance to the GC of 9.0 kpc. From the results in
   Groenewegen ( 2004, A\&A, 425, 595) it is found for carbon-rich Miras
   that the PL-relation implies a relative SMC-LMC DM of 0.38, assuming no
   metallicity dependence. This is somewhat smaller than the often quoted
   value near 0.50. Following theoretical work by Wood ( 1990, in From
   Miras to Planetary Nebulae, ed. M. O. Mennessier, \& A. Omont
   (Gif-sur-Yvette: Editions Frontieres), 67) a metallicity term of the
   form M-K similar to beta log Z is introduced. If a relative SMC-LMC DM
   of 0.50 is imposed, beta = 0.4 is required, and for that value the
   distance to the GC becomes 8.6 +/- 0.7 kpc ( for a LMC DM of 18.50),
   within the errorbar of the geometric determination of 7.9 +/- 0.4 kpc.
   An independent estimate leads to a distance estimate to the GC of 8.8
   +/- 0.4 kpc.},

Title = {Axial symmetry and rotation in the SiO maser shell of IK Tauri},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {625},
Pages = {978-984},
Abstract = {We observed v = 1, J = 1-043 GHz SiO maser emission toward the Mira
   variable IK Tauri ( IK Tau) using the Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA).
   The images resulting from these observations show that SiO masers form a
   highly elliptical ring of emission approximately 58; 32 mas with an
   axial ratio of 1.8:1. The major axis of this elliptical distribution is
   oriented at a position angle of similar to 59 degrees. The line-of-sight
   velocity structure of the SiO masers has an apparent axis of symmetry
   consistent with the elongation axis of the maser distribution. Relative
   to the assumed stellar velocity of 35 km s(-1), the blue- and redshifted
   masers were found to lie to the northwest and southeast of this symmetry
   axis, respectively. This velocity structure suggests a
   northwest-southeast (NW-SE) rotation of the SiO maser shell with an
   equatorial velocity, which we determine to be -3.6 km s(-1). Such a
   NW-SE rotation is in agreement with a circumstellar envelope geometry
   invoked to explain previous H2O and OH maser observations. In this
   geometry, H2O and OH masers are preferentially created in a region of
   enhanced density along the NE-SW equator orthogonal to the
   rotation/polar axis suggested by the SiO maser velocities.},

Title = {Dichroic masers due to radiation anisotropy and the influence of the
   Hanle effect on the circumstellar SiO polarization},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {625},
Pages = {985-995},
Abstract = {The theory of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation, mainly
   developed for interpreting solar spectropolarimetric observations,
   allows us to reconsider, in a more rigorous and elegant way, a physical
   mechanism that has been suggested some years ago to interpret the high
   degree of polarization often observed in astronomical masers. This
   mechanism, for which the name of ``dichroic maser'' is proposed, can
   operate when a low-density molecular cloud is illuminated by an
   anisotropic source of radiation ( e. g., a nearby star). Here we
   investigate completely unsaturated masers and show that selective
   stimulated emission processes are capable of producing highly polarized
   maser radiation in a nonmagnetic environment. The polarization of the
   maser radiation is linear and is directed tangentially to a ring
   equidistant to the central star. We show that the Hanle effect due to
   the presence of a magnetic field can produce a rotation ( from the
   tangential direction) of the polarization by more that 45 degrees for
   some selected combinations of the strength, inclination, and azimuth of
   the magnetic field vector. However, these very same conditions produce a
   drastic inhibition of the maser effect. The rotations of about 90
   degrees observed in SiO masers in the evolved stars TX Cam by
   Kemball\&Diamond and IRC + 10011 by Desmurs and coworkers may then be
   explained by a local modification of the anisotropy of the radiation
   field, being transformed from mainly radial to mainly tangential.},

Title = {Three-micron spectra of AGB stars and supergiants in nearby galaxies},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {434},
Pages = {691-706},
Abstract = {The dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied
   using infrared L- band spectra of AGB stars ( both carbon- rich and
   oxygen- rich) and M- type supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic
   Clouds ( LMC and SMC) and in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
   The spectra cover SiO bands for oxygen- rich stars, and acetylene (
   C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon- rich AGB stars. The equivalent width
   of acetylene is found to be high even at low metallicity. The high C2H2
   abundance can be explained with a high carbon- to- oxygen ( C/ O) ratio
   for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast, the HCN equivalent
   width is low: fewer than half of the extra- galactic carbon stars show
   the 3.5 mu m HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN equivalent
   width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon elemental
   abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
   mass, and stars with high luminosity ( i. e. high initial mass) could
   have a high HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-
   galactic and Galactic carbon stars. One SMC post- AGB star, SMC- S2,
   shows the 3.3 mu m PAH band. This first detection of a PAH band from an
   SMC post- AGB star confirms PAHs can form in these low- metallicity
   stars. None of the oxygen- rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
   possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the
   equivalent widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30
   angstrom for LMC metallicity. Several possible explanations are
   discussed, mostly based on the effect of pulsation and circumstellar
   dust. The observations imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach
   mass- loss rates as high as their Galactic counterparts, because there
   are more carbon atoms available and more carbonaceous dust can be
   formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO suggests less dust and lower
   mass- loss rates in low- metallicity oxygen- rich stars. The effect on
   the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.},

Abstract = {We report Very Long Baseline Array and Very Large Array observations of
   22 GHz H2O and 43 GHz SiO (v = 1, J = 1-0) maser emission as well as 7
   mm continuum emission in W43A, which exhibits a highly collimated jet of
   molecular gas and a spherically expanding envelope very similar to that
   of an OH/IR star. The spatiokinematical structure of the H2O masers is
   well fitted to a precessing jet model with an expansion velocity of 150
   km s(-1) and a dynamical age of similar to 50 yr. The spatiokinematical
   structure of the SiO masers is well fitted to a biconically expanding
   flow model, whose axis is parallel to the direction of the collimated
   jet. Astrometry of the H2O and SiO masers suggests that these maser
   sources have a common dynamical center, possibly as part of a binary
   system, within 70 AU. The SiO masers may be excited on the surface of
   the cone that has significant deceleration and interacts with the jet. A
   7 mm continuum emission source is located similar to 1300 AU away from
   these maser sources at a position angle of about -60 degrees from the
   jet axis. The physical relation of the continuum to the maser sources is

Title = {SiO masers in TX Cam - Simultaneous VLBA observations of two 43 GHz
   masers at four epochs},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {432},
Pages = {531-545},
Abstract = {We present the results of simultaneous high resolution observations of v
   = 1 and v = 2, J = 1- 0 SiO masers toward TX Cam at four epochs covering
   a stellar cycle. We used a new observing technique to determine the
   relative positions of the two maser maps. Near maser maximum ( Epochs
   III and IV), the individual components of both masers are distributed in
   ring-like structures but the ring is severely disrupted near stellar
   maser minimum ( Epochs I and II). In Epochs III and IV there is a large
   overlap between the radii at which the two maser transitions occur.
   However in both epochs the average radius of the v = 2 maser ring is
   smaller than for the v = 1 maser ring, the difference being larger for
   Epoch IV. The observed relative ring radii in the two transitions, and
   the trends on the ring thickness, are close to those predicted by the
   model of Humphreys et al. ( 2002, A\& A, 386, 256). In many individual
   features there is an almost exact overlap in space and velocity of
   emission from the two transitions, arguing against pure radiative
   pumping. At both Epochs III and IV in many spectral features only 50\%
   of the flux density is recovered in our images, implying significant
   smooth maser structure. For both transitions we find that red- and
   blue-shifted masers occur in all parts of the rings, with relatively few
   masers at the systemic velocity. Thus there is no evidence for rotation,
   although the blue-shifted masers are somewhat more prominent to the
   west. At all four epochs red- shifted components are generally brighter
   than blue-shifted ones. Blue-shifted masers become very weak at some
   stellar phases but never completely disappear. At Epochs III and IV, we
   see many filamentary or spoke-like features in both v = 1 and v = 2
   masers, especially in the red- shifted gas. These spokes show systematic
   velocity gradients consistent with a decelerating outward flow with
   increasing radius. We outline a possible model to explain why, given the
   presence of these spokes, there is a deficit of maser features at the
   systemic velocity. The breaking of spherical symmetry by spoke-like
   features may explain the high-velocity wings seen in SiO maser single
   dish spectra.},

   masers made during this period showed no drastic spatial variation
   except for emission features being shifted from south-west to
   north-east. The SiO maser flux decrease, and a succeeding optical
   quiescent phase, may indicate that the stellar mass-loss rate diminished
   over a few years around 1994. A SiO maser flare occurring in 1999 may be
   a reminiscence of a final gas blow, which resulted in the optically

Abstract = {We present sub-milliarcsecond observations of SiO masers in the

   Baseline Array (VLBA) to map the 43 GHz (v = 1, 2 J = 1-0) and the 86
   GHz (v = 1, 2 J = 2-1) SiO masers. All the transitions have been imaged
   except the v = 2 J = 2-1 in IRC+10011. We report the first VLBI map of
   the v = 1 J = 2-1 (SiO)-Si-28 maser in IRC+10011 as well as the first
   VLBA images of SiO masers in an S-type Mira variable, chiCyg. In this
   paper we have focused on the study of the relative spatial distribution
   of the different observed lines. We have found that in some cases the
   observational results are not reproduced by the current theoretical
   pumping models, either radiative or collisional. In particular, for
   IRC+10011, the v = 1 J = 1-0 and J = 2-1 (SiO)-Si-28 lines have
   different spatial distributions and emitting region sizes, the J = 2-1
   emission being located in an outer region of the envelope. For chiCyg,
   the distributions also differ, but the sizes of the masing regions are
   comparable. We suggest that the line overlaps between ro-vibrational
   transitions of two abundant molecular species, H2O and (SiO)-Si-28, is a
   possible explanation for the discrepancies found between the
   observations and the theoretical predictions. We have introduced this
   overlapping process in the calculations of the excitation of the SiO
   molecule. We conclude that the line overlaps can strongly affect the
   excitation of SiO and may reproduce the unexpected observational results
   for the two sources studied.},

Title = {Probing the inner wind of AGB stars: Interferometric observations of SiO
   millimetre line emission from the oxygen-rich stars R Dor and L-2 Pup},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {422},
Pages = {651-663},
Abstract = {High angular resolution Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)
   observations of SiO ``thermal{''} millimetre line emission towards the
   two oxygen-rich, low mass loss rate AGB stars R Dor and L-2 Pup are
   presented. In both cases the emission is resolved with an overall
   spherical symmetry. Detailed radiative transfer modelling of the SiO
   line emission has been performed, and the comparison between
   observations and models are conducted in the visibility plane,
   maximizing the sensitivity. The excitation analysis suggests that the
   abundance of SiO is as high as 4 x 10(-5) in the inner part of the wind,
   close to the predicted values from stellar atmosphere models. Beyond a
   radius of approximate to1 X 10(15) cm the SiO abundance is significantly
   lower, about 3 x 10(-6), until it decreases strongly at a radius of
   about 3 x 10(15) cm. This is consistent with a scenario where SiO first
   freezes out onto dust grains, and then eventually becomes
   photodissociated by the interstellar UV-radiation field. In these low
   expansion velocity sources the turbulent broadening of the lines plays
   an important role in the line formation. Microturbulent velocity widths
   in the range 1.1-1.5 km s(-1) result in a very good reproduction of the
   observed line shapes even if the gas expansion velocity is kept
   constant. This, combined with the fact that the SiO and CO lines are
   well fitted using the same gas expansion velocity (to within 5-10\%),
   suggest that the envelope acceleration occurs close to the stellar
   photosphere, within less than or similar to20-30 stellar radii.},

   produced in Si-N-O fiber growth},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {543-551},
Abstract = {The in situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum of gas-phase SiO
   produced in silicon oxynitride fiber growth has been quantitatively
   analyzed. Both absorption and emission FT-IR spectra at a spectral
   resolution of 0.5 cm(-1) were produced from the reaction zone at 1450
   degreesC. The fundamental and hot bands were observed with vibrational
   levels up to v = 7. For the purposes of quantitative analysis the
   individual vibration-rotation integrated line strengths for the three
   main isotopes, (SiO)-Si-28, (SiO)-Si-29, and (SiO)-Si-30, were
   calculated based on ab initio quantum chemical calculations of the
   electric dipole moment function and the transition moment. Vibrational
   anharmonicity and Hermann-Wallis correction factors were also
   incorporated. From the line strengths at specific temperatures and the
   known Dunham coefficients, the absorbance spectrum was simulated with
   best fits giving the averaged SiO concentration in the 400 mm reaction
   zone of 1.0 x 10(17) molecules/cm(3). Such quantitative measurements
   demonstrate the power of in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy combined
   with quantum chemical calculations. The rapid determination of synthetic
   calibration datasets for chemometric analysis can thus lead to
   correlation of gas-phase species concentrations with fiber growth
   properties and subsequently to real-time process control.},

Title = {SiO maser survey of the large-amplitude variables in the galactic center},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {261-294},
Abstract = {We have surveyed similar to400 known large-amplitude variables within
   15' of the galactic center in the SiO J = 1-0 v = 1 and 2 maser lines at
   43 GHz, resulting in 180 detections. SiO lines were detected from 16
   other sources located within 20{''} of the program objects. The
   detection rate of 48\% is comparable to that in bulge IRAS surveys.
   Among the detections, five stars have radial velocities greater than 200
   km s(-1). The detection rate increases steeply with the period of light
   variation, particularly for stars with P > 500 d, where it exceeds 80\%.
   At a given period, the SiO detection rate is approximately three-times
   that for OH. These facts suggest that the large-amplitude variables in
   the Nuclear Disk region are AGB stars similar in their overall
   properties to the inner and outer bulge IRAS/SiO sources. From the set
   of radial velocity data, the mass distribution within 30 pc of the
   galactic center was derived based on the collisionless Boltzmann
   equation integrated along the line of sight. The mass is about 6.5
   (+/-0.7) x 10(7) M-circle dot and the mass of the central black hole is
   2.7 (+/-1.3) x 10(6) M-circle dot. From the line-of-sight velocity of
   each star and its potential energy we conclude that the five
   high-velocity stars come from galactocentric distances as far as 300 pc.
   A high-velocity subsample of stars with negative radial velocities
   exhibits a tendency to have brighter K magnitudes than a subsample with
   positive velocities. The origin of these stars is discussed.},

Abstract = {We surveyed 401 color-selected IRAS sources in the galactic disk in the

   new) detections. The observed sources lie mostly in a strip of the inner

   < 1 < 40 exhibits fewer objects coincident with the molecular ring
   feature than does the OH 1612 MHz source l-v map, indicating a slight
   difference of stellar type between SiO and OH emitting stars. After
   identifying all of the SiO detected sources in the 2MASS near-infrared
   catalog, we computed their luminosity distances based on the infrared
   fluxes. We then mapped these objects onto the first quadrant of the
   galactic plane. Combining the distances with the SiO radial velocities,
   we obtained a pattern speed for SiO maser sources, Omegap = 21(+/-

   of any dynamical models. The increase of the pattern speed toward the

Journal = AA,
Year = {2004},

Abstract = {We present new total intensity and linear polarization VLBA observations
   of the nu=2 and nu=1 J=1-0 maser transitions of SiO at 42.8 and 43.1 GHz
   in a number of Mira variable stars over a substantial fraction of their
   pulsation periods. These observations were part of an observing program
   that also includes interferometric measurements at 2.2 and 3.6 micron
   (Mennesson et al. 2002); comparison of the results from different
   wavelengths allows studying the envelope independently of the poorly
   known distances to these stars. Nine stars were observed at from one to
   four epochs during 2001. The SiO emission is largely confined to rings
   which are smaller than the inner radius of the dust shells reported by
   Danchi et al. (1994). Two stars (U Orionis, R Aquarii) have maser rings
   with diameters corresponding to the size of the hot molecular layer as
   measured at 3.6 micron; in the other cases, the SiO rings are
   substantially larger. Variations of ring diameter for most, but not all
   stars, had an rms amplitude in agreement with the models of Humphreys et
   al. (2002) although the expected relationship between the diameter and
   pulsation phase was not seen. The ring diameter in U Orionis shows
   remarkably small variation. A correlation between the 2.2/3.6 mum
   diameter ratio with that of the SiO/3.6 mum diameter ratio is likely due
   to differences in the opacities at 2.2 and 3.6 mum in a molecular layer.
   A further correlation with the inner size of the dust shell reported by
   Danchi et al. (1994) suggest some differences in the temperature
   structure. Clear evidence is seen in R Aquarii for an equatorial disk
   similar to that reported by Hollis et al. (2001); rotation is possibly
   also detected in S Coronae Boralis.},

   energy transfer via molecule-molecule binary collisions. Two regions can
   be inferred from the data: one characterized by a temperature of around

   degrees Kelvin. Improved Dunham coefficients and correction terms for
   the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation have been determined

   the experimentally unknown 2-4(2) Pi states. Two avoided crossings, one
   between the 2-3 2 Pi PECs and the other between the 3-4(2) Pi PECs, are
   found to have a marked characteristic of a small minimum energy
   difference between the relevant PECs; 0.12 eV for the former and 0.04 eV
   for the latter. Each small minimum energy difference results principally
   from the lack of direct interaction between two main configuration state
   functions (CSFs) in the CI wavefunctions for the two 2 Pi states
   concerned, since the off-diagonal CI matrix element between the two main
   CSFs vanishes identically. The reasons for both the vanishing and the
   non-vanishing CI matrix elements in terms of the CSFs, which are
   important for the description of the two avoided crossings, are
   explained from the standpoints of the Slater-Condon rules and symmetry
   properties of the important CSFs. The main CSFs mix through the direct
   interactions with intermediary CSFs, representing the near-degeneracy
   effect resulting in the avoided crossing.},

   strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core-valence
   basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard
   correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the
   exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized
   with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence-electron
   correlated calculations, i.e., for the core-core plus core-valence
   correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets,
   which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first row
   atoms {[}D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103, 4572
   (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence to
   the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set limit, the
   intershell (core-valence) correlation energy converges more slowly than
   the intrashell (core-core) correlation energy. Since the effect of
   including the core electrons on the calculation of molecular properties
   tends to be dominated by core-valence correlation effects, a second
   scheme for determining the augmenting functions was investigated. In
   this approach, the exponents of the functions to be added to the cc-pVnZ
   sets were optimized with respect to just the core-valence (intershell)
   correlation energy, except that a small amount of core-core correlation
   energy was included in order to ensure systematic convergence to the
   complete basis set limit. These new sets, denoted weighted core-valence
   basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ), significantly improve the convergence of many
   molecular properties with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row
   atoms were also developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ
   and cc-pwCVnZ basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)]
   calculations on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules
   (Al-2, Si-2, P-2, S-2, and Cl-2), as well as on selected diatomic
   molecules involving first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the
   calculation of core correlation effects on energetic and spectroscopic
   properties, the cc-pwCVnZ basis sets are recommended over the cc-pCVnZ
   ones. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Moderate resolution (approximate to400) 2.38-45.2 mum infrared spectra
   of stars without dust features were obtained with the Short Wavelength
   Spectrometer (SWS) on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The
   observations are part of a larger program with the objective to extend
   and refine the current infrared classification schemes. In particular,
   our data provide the basis for a more detailed classification of the
   1.N-1.NO sources (ordinary and oxygen rich naked stars) as defined by
   Kraemer et al. (2002) in a comprehensive classification of the ISO-SWS
   spectra. For our analysis, the continuum was determined by fitting
   Engelke's function (Engelke 1992) to the SWS data. The stellar angular
   diameters derived from these estimates of the continuum are in good
   agreement with values obtained by other methods. Analysis of the
   equivalent widths of the CO fundamental and first overtone molecular
   bands, the SiO fundamental and first overtone, as well as the H2O
   bending mode band as a function of MK class, reveals that there is
   sufficient information in the SWS spectra to distinguish between hot (B,
   A, F) and cool stars. Furthermore, it is possible to determine the
   spectral type for the G, K and M giants, and subtype ranges in a
   sequence of K and M giants. The equivalent widths of the CO and SiO
   bands are found to be well correlated in K and M stars, such that the
   equivalent widths of the CO fundamental, the SiO first overtone and the
   SiO fundamental can be reasonably well extrapolated from the depth of
   the CO first overtone. We have identified two stars, HR 365 and V Nor,
   whose mid-infrared spectrum does not correspond to their respective
   optical classification. HR 365 may have a late M companion, which
   dominates the observed infrared spectrum while V Nor is a late type
   giant that was included because its spectrum was classified as
   featureless under the IRAS LRS scheme. According to Kraemer et al.
   (2002), V Nor has a thin dust shell, which distorts the analysis of its
   mid-infrared absorption bands.},

Year = {2002},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {824-833},
Abstract = {During the past decade the one-center mean-field approximation has
   proven to be a very appropriate framework for the accurate description
   of spin-orbit effects at the correlated all-electron level. Here, a new
   efficient code, SPOCK, is introduced that calculates spin-orbit matrix
   elements in the one-center mean-field approximation for multireference
   CI wave functions. For the first time, the computation of spin-dependent
   interactions within a Kohn-Sham orbital based Cl (DFT/MRCI) scheme(1) is
   made possible. The latter approach is suitable for large scale systems
   with up to 100-200 valence electrons. Test calculations are performed on
   well-known diatomic molecules and the thiocarbonyl pyranthione.
   Spin-orbit matrix elements show good agreement with their Hartree-Fock
   orbital based counterparts but are obtained at considerably lower
   expense, thus demonstrating the power of the method. As an application
   singlet-triplet couplings in thiophene are investigated that are
   important for the photophysics and photochemistry. Spin-orbit matrix
   elements between all pi --> pi{*} excited states are found to be small.
   Considerably larger spin-orbit matrix elements are observed only for
   cases in which pi - sigma{*} excited configurations are involved. (C)

Title = {Numerical simulations of stellar SiO maser variability - Investigation
   of the effect of shocks},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {386},
Pages = {256-270},
Abstract = {A stellar hydrodynamic pulsation model has been combined with a SiO
   maser model in an attempt to calculate the temporal variability of SiO
   maser emission in the circumstellar envelope (CE) of a model AGB star.
   This study investigates whether the variations in local physical
   conditions brought about by shocks are the predominant contributing
   factor to SiO maser variability because, in this work, the radiative
   part of the pump is constant. We find that some aspects of the
   variability are not consistent with a pump provided by shock-enhanced
   collisions alone. In these simulations, gas parcels of relatively
   enhanced SiO abundance are distributed in a model CE by a Monte Carlo
   method, at a single epoch of the stellar cycle. From this epoch on,
   Lagrangian motions of individual parcels are calculated according to the
   velocity fields encountered in the model CE during the stellar pulsation
   cycle. The potentially masing gas parcels therefore experience different
   densities and temperatures, and have varying line-of-sight velocity
   gradients throughout the stellar cycle, which may or may not be suitable
   to produce maser emission. At each epoch (separated by 16.6 days),
   emission lines from the parcels are combined to produce synthetic
   spectra and VLBI-type images. We report here the results for v = 1,J =
   1-0 (43-GHz) and J = 2-1 (86-GHz) masers and compare synthetic
   lineshapes and images with those observed. Strong SiO maser emission is
   calculated to form in an unfilled ring within a few stellar radii of the
   photosphere, indicating a tangential amplification process. The diameter
   of the synthetic maser ring is dependent upon stellar phase, as clearly
   observed for TX Cam, and upon maser transition. Proper motions of
   brightly masing parcels are comparable to measurements for some maser
   components in R Aqr and TX Cam, although we are unable to reproduce all
   of the observed motions. Synthetic lineshapes peak at the stellar
   velocity, have typical Mira linewidths and vary in intensity with
   stellar phase. However, the model fails quantitatively in several
   respects. We attribute these failings to (i) lack of an accurate,
   time-varying stellar IR field (ii) post-shock kinetic temperatures which
   are too high, due to the cooling function included in our model and
   (iii) the lack of a detailed treatment of the chemistry of the inner CE.
   We expect the use of oxygen-rich hydrodynamical stellar models which are
   currently under development to alleviate these problems.},

Title = {Methanol and silicon monoxide observations toward bipolar outflows

Journal = APJ,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {567},
Pages = {980-998},
Abstract = {We report Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope observations of seven
   bipolar outflows thought to be associated with Class 0 objects in the
   upsilon=0 J=3-->2 and J=2-->1 transitions of SiO and J(k)= 3(k)-->2(k)
   and J(k)=2(k)-->1k transitions of CH(3)OH. Methanol and silicon monoxide
   emission from outflowing gas were detected toward the lobes of four
   objects (NGC 2264G, IRAS 16293-2422, Serpens S68N, and Serpens SMM 4).
   The SiO line profiles are characteristics of C-type bow shocks, showing
   a peak at a radial velocity close to but displaced from the ambient
   cloud velocity and a gradual decrease in intensity from the peak toward
   higher flow velocities. There is a significant correlation between the
   column density of SiO and the terminal SiO flow velocity, which suggests
   a velocity-selective enhancement in the production of SiO molecules. We
   find that the SiO abundance in the lobes is enhanced with respect to
   that of the ambient cloud by a factor of at least 330 in IRAS 16293-2422
   and SMM 4, 170 in NGC 2264G, and 80 in S68N. The abundance is enhanced
   by a factor of 500 in CH 3 OH IRAS 16293-2422, 330 in SMM 4, 80 in S68N,
   and 23 in NGC 2264G. In addition, we find that the dependence of the
   SiO/CO and CH(3)OH/CO abundance ratios with radial flow velocity shows a
   steep increase in the range from similar to0 to similar to4-5 km s(-1)
   and a gradual decline toward higher flow velocities. In the remaining
   three sources (CG 30, IRAS 13036-7644, and VLA 1623-243), emission in
   methanol was detected from a narrow line at the velocity of the ambient
   cloud, and no emission was detected in silicon monoxide. Weak methanol
   emission from a low-velocity outflow component was detected toward CG

   Batint-Kurti, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 4966 (1999)]. Potential optimized
   discrete variable representation techniques were used to compute
   vibrational matrix elements of this potential and the infinite order
   sudden method was then used to compute the required cross sections. The
   potential is very anisotropic and complicated. This is mirrored in the
   form of the vibrational matrix elements and in their behavior as a
   function of the scattering coordinate and of the Jacobi angle. The
   properties of the potential are markedly different from those of the
   He+SiO system which has previously been used to model the behavior of

   of vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, as well as a large energy
   range, are made available through the journal's EPAPS service. The
   inelastic cross sections computed here are needed in the modeling of
   circumstellar SiO maser radiation. Significant structure is observed in
   the computed inelastic cross sections. This structure is of a

Pages = {61-71},
Abstract = {Mapping and monitoring observations of SiO maser sources near the
   Galactic center were made with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope at 43 GHz.
   Rectangular mapping an area of approximately 200{''} x 100{''} in a
   30{''} grid, and triangular mapping in a 20{''} grid toward the Galactic
   center, resulted in 15 detections of SiO sources; the positions of the
   sources were obtained with errors of 5-10{''}, except for a few weak
   sources. Three-year monitoring observations found that the component at
   V-lsr = -27 km s(-1) of IRS 10 EE flared to about 1.5 Jy during 2000
   March-May, which was a factor of more than 5 brighter than its normal
   intensity. Using the radial velocities and positions of the SiO sources,
   we identified 5 which are counterparts of previously observed OH 1612
   MHz sources. The other 10 SiO sources have no OH counterparts, but two
   were previously detected with VLA, and four are located close to the
   positions of large-amplitude variables observed at near-infrared
   wavelengths. A least-squares fit to a plot of velocities versus Galactic
   longitudes gives a rather high speed for the rotation of the star
   cluster around the Galactic center. The observed radial-velocity
   dispersion is roughly consistent with a value obtained before. It was
   found that all of the SiO sources with OH 1612 MHz counterparts have
   periods of light variation longer than 450 days, while SiO sources
   without OH masers often have periods shorter than 450 days. This fact
   suggests that lower-mass AGB stars are more often detected in SiO masers
   than in the OH 1612 MHz line.},

   A(1)Pi-X(1)Sigma(+) transition was analyzed in detail. Comparison of the
   experimental data with an emission model for SiO indicated significant
   vibrational non-equilibrium. The level of vibrational excitation was
   quantified in terms of a vibrational temperature independent of a
   translational temperature, The best-fit model results obtained by
   comparison with the experimental data, yielded a translational
   temperature of T-trans = 3250 +/- 500 K and a vibrational temperature of
   T-vib = 15 000 +/- 5000 K for high oxygen concentration systems. The
   vibrational temperature corresponds to an energy equivalent of similar
   to 29 kcal/mol and changes in fractional population of over an order of
   magnitude from equilibrium distributions for some vibrational levels.
   For low oxygen concentration systems, the vibrational temperature was
   significantly higher T-vib = 40000 +/- 15000 K, which indicates a

Abstract = {The results of an SiO maser survey for late-type stars selected by the
   IRTS (Infrared Telescope in Space) are presented. We have detected SiO J
   = 1-0, v = 1 and/or v = 2 lines in 27 stars out of 59 stars. The maser
   intensity increases with the depth of the H2O absorption in the infrared
   spectra and redness of the 2.2 and 12 mum color. The column densities of
   the water vapor in the target stars were estimated from the depth of the
   water absorption in the IRTS spectra. We found that the SiO maser was
   detected mostly in the stars with a column density of water vapor higher
   than 3 x 10(19)-3 x 10(20) cm(-2). We further estimated the density of
   hydrogen molecules in the outer atmosphere corresponding to these column
   densities, obtaining 10(9)-10(10) cm(-3) as a lower limit. These values
   are roughly in agreement with the critical hydrogen density predicted by
   models for the excitation of SiO masers. It is possible that the SiO
   masers are excited in clumps with column density even higher than this
   value. The present results provide useful information for the
   understanding of the physical conditions of the outer atmospheres in

Abstract = {The adiabatic electron affinities of five second row atoms (Al, Si, P,

   different density functional or hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional
   methods. The 15 species selected form a convenient closed set for which
   reliable experimental electron affinities exist for 13 of the species.
   Zero-point vibrational energy corrected electron affinities are also
   reported. Equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies were
   determined with each density functional method. The method based on the
   Becke exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation (BLYP)
   functional reproduced the experimental electron affinities most
   accurately, having an average absolute error of 0.15 eV. Using this
   functional, the electron affinities were predicted for SiO and SiO2,
   molecules for which electron affinities are not known experimentally, as
   0.11 eV and 2.03 eV, respectively. It is concluded that the accuracy
   observed for density functional theory methods applied to first row
   atoms and molecules extends to molecules containing second row atoms and

   affordable means of producing electron affinities reliable to within a

   bands nn AGB stars},
Journal = AA,
Year = {1999},
Volume = {342},
Pages = {799-808},
Abstract = {The first overtone rotation-vibration transitions of SiO give rise to
   prominent bandheads in the wavelength range between 4.0 and 4.5 mu m. In
   order to study the behaviour of these features in AGE stars we observed
   the 3.94 to 4.12 mu m spectra for a sample of 23 oxygen-rich late-type
   variables. In contrast to the SRb objects, the Miras show a Very large
   scatter of the equivalent widths of the SiO bands. Despite their cool
   temperatures some of them have only weak or no SiO absorption, which
   seems to be related to their strong pulsations producing a large
   variability of the features. When comparing the band intensities with
   photometric data, we found a general decrease with bluer IRAS (12-25)
   colors. However, this trend may only reflect the different behaviour of
   the Miras and SRb stars in our sample. We did not discover any
   correlation of the equivalent widths with the effective temperatures
   derived from (J-K), or with the (K-12) color and the IRAS-LRS class,
   both of which can be regarded as a rough measure for the thickness of
   the circumstellar shell.
   In Paper I of this series (Aringer et al. 1997a) we have shown that
   synthetic spectra calculated from hydrostatic MARCS atmospheres are
   successful in reproducing the observed band intensities of giants with
   spectral types earlier than about M5 III and M2 II. However, they
   generally predict too strong features for very cool and extended
   objects, as they are discussed in this work. And they fail completely
   when it comes to Miras with weak or no SiO absorption. These stars are
   dominated by dynamical phenomena and, not surprisingly they can
   therefore not be described by hydrostatic structures. Thus, we have also
   computed synthetic spectra based on experimental dynamical models.
   Although they still have some shortcomings? we demonstrate that, in
   principle, they are able to explain the whole range of equivalent widths
   of the observed SiO bandheads and their variations.},

Journal = APJ,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {509},
Pages = {768-784},
Abstract = {We report observations of the J = 3 --> 2 and J = 2 --> 1 transitions of
   SiO and CS, the J(k) = 3(k) --> 2(k) and J(k) = 2(k) --> 1(k)
   transitions of CH(3)OH, and the J = 1 --> 0 transition of HCO(+), made
   with Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST), toward the highly
   collimated bipolar outflow BHR 71. Broad wing emission was detected
   toward the outflow lobes in all the observed molecular lines. The shapes
   of the profiles are strikingly different from molecule to molecule. For
   CS and HCO(+) the emission from the outflowing gas appears as a weak
   broad feature superposed upon a strong narrow emission from the
   quiescent ambient gas. For CH,OH the intensity of the broad emission
   feature is considerably stronger than that of the narrow component,
   whereas for SiO the broad feature completely dominates the emission
   spectra. The spatial distribution of the integrated wing emission is
   considerably extended and broadly similar in all the observed molecular
   transitions, showing well-separated blueshifted and redshifted lobes
   with FWHM angular sizes of 2'.4 x 1'.3 and 2'.4 x 1'.4, respectively. We
   find that the abundance of methanol and silicon monoxide in the outflow
   lobes is enhanced with respect to that of the ambient cloud by factors
   of up to similar to 40 and 350, respectively. The large enhancements of
   methanal and silicon monoxide in the outflow lobes are most likely due
   to the release from grains of ice mantles and Si-bearing species via
   shocks produced by the interaction between the outflow and dense ambient

   absorption in N-type and SC-type stars},
Journal = AA,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {340},
Pages = {222-231},
Abstract = {We carried out observations of bright optical carbon stars by the ISO
   SWS, and detected the absorption features of CO, CS, CH, SiS and HCN in
   N-type and SC-type stars.
   We found several characteristics of molecular absorption features
   corresponding to the spectral types. The CH fundamental bands in 3-4 mu
   m in N-type stars are stronger than those in SC-type stars. On the other
   hand, the first overtone bands of SIS at 6.6 mu m were detected in WZ
   Cas (SC-type), while none of them were detected in N-type stars. These
   results can be explained well by the lower C/O ratio in SC-type stars
   than in N-type stars, The absorption features of HCN (nu(1), nu(2) +
   nu(3) and nu(1) - nu(2)) are stronger in SC-type stars than in N-type
   stars. This fact can be explained by the cooler atmospheres of our
   SC-type stars due to the lower C/O ratio as well as to the lower
   effective temperature, compared with the N-type stars in our sample.
   The CS first overtone bands and the band heads of the CO fundamental
   bands are weaker in the observed spectra than in the ones predicted by
   our model atmospheres. Though the fundamental bands of CS were detected
   in TX Psc (N-type), the band heads are quite weak, and none of the
   fundamental bands of CS were identified in the other stars. These
   results suggest a contribution by the emission of CO and CS in the outer
   atmosphere.},

Abstract = {We have made a survey of SiO in 29 of our standard sample of 11 cirrus
   cores and 27 Clemens-Barvainis translucent cores the structures and
   chemistry of which have been studied earlier in this series. SiO is
   detected in six objects, favoring those with large products of the local
   radiation field I-UV and the column density. The fractional abundance of
   SiO is 1 x 10(-10) in these six objects, and 1 x 10(-11) over the
   remaining 23 searched objects for which an average of the observations
   yielded a detection. These SiO abundances are intermediate between those
   found in energetic star-forming regions (similar to 1 x 10(-8)) and
   upper limits of similar to 2 x 10(-12) found in cold dense clouds. We
   have analyzed the gas-phase chemistry of SiO and find that the
   temperature-dependent reactions Si + (OH, O-2) --> SiO cannot explain
   the strong dependence of SiO abundance upon cloud temperature, contrary
   to the conclusion of Langer \& Glassgold. We have analyzed the SiO
   abundance characteristics in terms of accretion on and photodesorption
   from grains. Cosmic-ray desorption is found to be negligible. The same
   analysis applied to many other species studied in the translucent cloud
   series points to a uniquely strong binding of Si atoms onto grains,
   unlike the situation for other elements (C, N, O, S). We find this by
   determining a photodesorption yield factor for each molecular species
   which is consistent with the observations of the many species in both
   translucent and cold dense clouds, which agrees with experimental values
   for C, N, O, and S species, and which is much smaller for Si than for
   the other elements. Special binding mechanisms for Si onto grains are
   discussed.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {1997},
Volume = {323},
Pages = {202-210},
Abstract = {In order to study the behavior of the SiO bands of cool oxygen-rich
   stars we have computed a grid of 138 hydrostatic model atmospheres using
   an improved version of the MARCS code and new SiO line data. We found
   that the corresponding opacity never produces large changes of the
   atmospheric structure, especially if one compares it with the enormous
   effects from TiO or water. Based on the atmospheres, synthetic SiO
   spectra have been calculated with a high resolution for the photometric
   L-band and with a low resolution (opacity sampling) for the large
   wavelength range between 2.0 and 12.5 mu m, which includes the
   fundamental as well as the first and second overtone transitions. Thus,
   we could study the behavior of the SiO bands as a function of different
   stellar parameters. It turned out that the intensity of the absorption
   features monotonously increases with lower temperature and gravitational
   acceleration as well as with higher metallicity. We expect the strongest
   bands in the coolest and most extended objects. When we compared our
   results to observations of K and M giants, we found a good agreement
   showing the correctness of the line data and atmospheres. On the other
   hand the calculations can not reproduce the relatively weak and variable
   bands of AGE stars indicating that our classical model atmospheres may
   not always work for this kind of objects. This will be discussed in a
   second paper, where we will focus on our observations of AGE stars.},

Abstract = {The structural properties and vibrational spectra of the SiO, SiO-,
   SiONa, and SiOK molecules have been calculated using density functional

   with fairly long O-M (M = Na, K) distance (2.17 Angstrom and 2.435
   Angstrom, respectively) and Si-O-M bond angles close to 100 degrees. The
   nature of the bonding within the different species has also been studied
   using Bader's topological method. It appears that the interactions
   between the SiO molecule and Na (or K) atom result primarily from a
   charge transfer effect from the metal to the SiO subunit. The net
   transferred charge is essentially borne on the Si atom. The calculated
   moderately large red shift of the SiO stretching mode upon complexation
   agrees very well with the experimental result, and the positions of the

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {1997},
Volume = {101},
Pages = {2365-2370},
Abstract = {The reaction of O(D-1) with silane has been investigated by using a
   laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. O(D-1) was produced by the
   ArF laser photolysis of N2O and was detected by LIF at 115.2 mm. The
   overall fate constant of the O(D-1) + SiH4 reaction was directly
   determined from the decay rates of O(D-1) to be (3.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-10)
   cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at room temperature. H and OH were detected as
   direct products of this reaction. By calibrating the LIF intensities of
   H and OH using the reference reaction of O(D-1) + H-2 --> H + OH,
   product branching fractions of H and OH were determined to be 0.21 and
   0.36, respectively. In addition to these products, SiO was also detected
   by the LIF method. The production rate of SiO was found to be in good
   agreement with the decay rate of O(D-1), indicating that SiO is one of
   the direct products of the O(D-1) + SiH4 reaction. The yield of SiO was
   estimated to be about 6-13\% on the basis of the LIF intensity. The
   vibrational distribution of SiO (up to upsilon = 11) was well described
   by a prior distribution derived from a conventional statistical theory
   with the assumption that SiO was produced by the multiple step
   unimolecular decomposition of excited silanol formed by the insertion of
   O(D-1) into SiH4. A possible reaction pathway to produce SiO is
   discussed.},

   The production of maser fragments in this manner is compatible with the
   Alfven speeds in them greatly exceeding their kinematic and thermal
   speeds. The magnetic structure in an evolved star's envelope probably
   results in momentum transfer to gas from grains subject to radiation

Pages = {607-616},
Abstract = {Highly sensitive simultaneous observations of the 2-->1 line of the
   first vibrationally excited state of SiO, and of the 2-->1 line of CO
   have been obtained toward 37 O-rich evolved stars. In similar to 45\% of
   these objects, the SiO line profiles present unusually broad wings,
   reaching, and in some cases exceeding, the terminal velocity of the
   circumstellar envelope. All of the objects exhibiting SiO line wings are
   Mira or semiregular variables and most of them have terminal velocities
   for their circumstellar envelopes below 10-12 kms(-1) and moderate mass
   loss rates. In the opposite, all the OH/IR stars have very narrow SiO
   lines relative to the CO linewidth.
   In R Leo, the velocity extent of the SiO emission shows a time
   variability. Variations of the SiO line wings are also observed in other
   O-rich stars between 1994 and 1995. The time variations observed in
   these objects suggest changes in the physical structure and velocity
   field of the innermost regions of the envelopes over timescales of
   months/years no necessarily related to the periodic optical pulsation of
   Mira stars.
   Our data, which lack of angular resolution to resolve the SiO emission,
   cannot give an unique answer to the origin of the SiO line wings.
   However, radiative transfer models indicate that in stars with large
   terminal velocities for their circumstellar envelopes, the effects of
   turbulence and rotation are negligible in the emergent line wings. On
   the contrary, rotating Kleperian disks can produce prominent line wings
   in envelopes with moderate or low terminal velocities. The effect of
   asymmetric mass loss processes and of gas infall/outflow on the emergent
   SiO line profile have been also analyzed and can explain, at least
   qualitatively, the presence of SiO line wings.},

Title = {A line survey of Orion KL from 325 to 360 GHz},
Journal = APJS,
Year = {1997},

Abstract = {We present a high-sensitivity spectral line survey of the high-mass
   star-forming region Orion KL in the 325-360 GHz frequency band. The
   survey was conducted at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna
   Kea, Hawaii. The sensitivity achieved is typically 0.1-0.5 K and is
   limited mostly by the sideband separation method utilized. We find 717
   resolvable features consisting of 1004 lines, among which 60 are
   unidentified. The identified lines are due to 34 species and various
   isotopomers. Most of the unidentified lines are weak, and many of them
   most likely due to isotopomers or vibrationally or torsionally excited
   states of known species with unknown line frequencies, but a few reach
   the 2-5 K level. No new species have been identified, but we were able
   to strengthen evidence for the identification of ethanol in Orion and
   found the first nitrogen sulfide line in this source. The molecule
   dominating the integrated line emission is SO2, which emits twice the
   intensity of CO, followed by SO, which is only slightly stronger than
   CO. In contrast, the largest number of lines is emitted from heavy
   organic rotors like HCOOCH3, CH3CH2CN, and CH3OCH3, but their
   contribution to the total flux is unimportant. CH3OH is also very
   prominent, both in the number of lines and in integrated flux. An
   interesting detail of this survey is the first detection of
   vibrationally excited HCN in the v(2) = 2 state, 2000 K above ground.
   Clearly this is a glimpse into the very inner part of the Orion hot
   core.},

Title = {Optical pumping of circumstellar SiO masers},
Journal = AA,
Year = {1996},
Volume = {315},
Pages = {533-541},
Abstract = {We investigate the influence of the photospheric line spectrum on the
   optical pumping of circumstellar SiO molecules. As pump radiation we
   consider in particular the synthetic line spectrum of an M-star
   atmosphere (T-eff = 3000 K). The pump intensity in a given line depends
   sensitively on the velocity difference between envelope and photosphere.
   The pump intensities in different lines may vary due to the deep
   absorption features of the spectrum. Thus, the question whether there
   arises population inversion in circumstellar SiO molecules, not only
   depends on the SiO abundance, the density, and the velocity gradient in
   the envelope, but also on the absolute value of the velocity difference
   between envelope and photosphere.
   The aim of the present investigation is to find out under which physical
   conditions inversion occurs. We have shown that optical pumping causes
   maser emission without the need of collisions. Our findings differ
   substantially from the results of similar calculations assuming the
   spectrum of the pump radiation to correspond to that of a black body. We
   have done the calculations for three different isotopomeres of SiO and
   we have shown that the regions of inversion in parameter space are
   distinct for the various isotopomeres due to the frequency differences
   in the pump lines and due to the velocity difference Delta(vr) between
   the photosphere and the emitting volume element.},

Abstract = {A hydrodynamic pulsation model for long-period M-type Mira variables is
   used to estimate the physical conditions of number density, temperature
   and velocity field in the circumstellar envelope of a model star of 1
   M., 332-d period, surface temperature 3000 K and mass-loss rate 1.8 x
   10(-7) M. yr(-1). These conditions have previously been used in a model
   of SiO masers to establish, for a single stellar phase, the nature and
   location of the zone in which SiO masers should form. Using Monte Carlo
   techniques, a synthetic image of 43-GHz emission is generated, showing
   that masers are predicted to form in an approximate ring 1 to 2 stellar
   radii from the photosphere, in agreement with the results of recent very
   long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. A new image of SiO
   masers around TX Cam, obtained using the Very Long Baseline Array
   (VLBA), is presented, which shows these characteristics. Models show
   that masers do not form in the region in which the stellar wind is fully
   developed. Amplification is dominated by tangential paths through the
   limbs of the circumstellar envelope. Synthetic lineshapes for a variety
   of maser transitions show structure and linewidths that are typical of

Pages = {883-895},
Abstract = {We present high-sensitivity observations of the SiO transition v=2
   J=2-1, which is known to present anomalous maser emission, together with
   simultaneous observations of the v=1 J=2-1 intense maser. Only 3 stars
   were previously detected in the v=2 J=2-1 transition. We present 8 new
   detections (out of a total of 10 detected stars) and significant upper
   limits for 37 other stars, which allows for the first time a statistical
   study of this maser transition. The unexpectedly weak emission in this
   line is confirmed. There is also a clear trend favoring the emission of
   the v=2 J=2-1 line in S-type stars, with respect to O-rich sources (that
   are the most common emitters in the other SiO lines): the v=2/v=1 J=2-1
   line ratio is at least 10 times larger in S-type stars than in M-type
   sources. We also find a trend of the v=2 J=2-1 emission to be relatively
   red-shifted, confirming a previous result for one source. The possible
   origin of these properties is discussed. We conclude that the mechanism
   previously proposed by Olofsson et al., introducing the effects of line
   overlap between one re-vibrational transition of SiO and another one of
   H2O, can explain the observed peculiarities of the SiO v=2 J=2-1 line.},

Journal = CP,
Year = {1996},
Volume = {206},
Pages = {173-183},
Abstract = {A controlled and readily reproducible thermolysis of silane (SiH4)
   entrained in both an argon and helium carrier is used to form the
   precursor whose oxidation prepares long-lived yet readily monitored SiO
   b(3)II metastables in high yield. A simple yet novel pyrolysis-N2O
   oxidation source produces the b(3)II metastables, yet no evidence is
   obtained for the formation of the lower-lying SiO a(3) Sigma(+) state.
   This result, which is in sharp contrast to observations made when an
   oven entrained silicon beam is oxidized with N2O, suggests either an
   unusual symmetry constraint and selective reaction branching to the
   b(3)II state or the highly efficient quenching of the a(3) Sigma(+)
   stale. This implies that a surprisingly similar quenching of the a(3)
   Sigma(+) State must occur in distinctly different helium or argon
   diluted silane based environments. An analysis of the observed SiO
   A(1)II-X(1) Sigma(+) and b(3)II-X(1) Sigma(+) emission band systems
   produced with the silane based source demonstrates that the SiO b(3)II.
   state is formed apparently selectively in a ratio exceeding 2200 times
   that of the remaining SiO excited states. The results obtained with the
   present pyrolysis N2O source are contrasted to the continuous
   chemiluminescent emissions associated with thermalized silane-ozone and
   silane-oxygen reaction environments. The current means of generating SiO
   metastables would appear to (1) allow the creation of a long path length
   medium for the efficient energy transfer pumping of visible chemical
   laser amplifiers and oscillators and (2) form the basis of a useful
   method for the control and efficient monitoring of SiO surface
   deposition processes.},

Title = {MODELS OF SIO MASERS IN M-MIRAS, SUPERGIANTS AND OH/IR STARS},
Journal = AA,
Year = {1995},
Volume = {302},
Pages = {797-810},
Abstract = {Results are presented of an extensive new model of circumstellar SiO
   masers, involving 200 rovibrational levels for upsilon = 0 to 4,
   including saturated maser radiation transport. The model incorporates
   radiative and collisional pumping, involving both dust and stellar
   radiation. Unsaturated gain coefficients are calculated for conditions
   appropriate to both M-Miras and supergiants, grouped together, and for
   OH/IR stars. We find that the characteristics of M-Miras and
   supergiants, displaying many maser lines simultaneously, are reproduced
   through collisional pumping at 1500 K, typically similar to 1 stellar
   radius from the stellar surface, at a number density of similar to 5
   10(9) H-2 cm(-3), in an environment experiencing only a weak dust
   continuum radiation field. Good agreement is established between the
   physical conditions calculated in theoretical models of M-Mira
   atmospheres and the parameters required by our model to yield the
   observed SiO masers. SiO masers in OH/IR stars form under distinctly
   different conditions, through radiative pumping in an environment
   experiencing a powerful dust radiation field, at typically an order of
   magnitude higher number density, with a variety of physical conditions
   reflecting the diverse character of these objects. For both M-Miras and
   supergiants and for OH/IR stars, certain line ratios are correctly
   reproduced by the unsaturated gain coefficients, and other line ratios
   are not. For example, the unsaturated gain coefficient in upsilon = 2, J
   = 1-0 is always too weak in our calculations.
   Saturated SiO maser propagation is also considered, using a treatment
   which includes coupling of the saturating effects of the masers to the
   kinetic scheme involved in the inversion pumping (Field \& Gray 1988).
   Competitive gain, arising through saturation, causes qualitatively new
   behaviour to arise in low J transitions. An important consequence of
   maser saturation in M-Miras and supergiants is that the upsilon = 2, J =
   1-0 transition becomes the dominant maser in upsilon = 2, as observed.
   Unsaturated population inversions may therefore be a poor guide to the
   saturated maser intensities in M-Miras and supergiants. Results for
   OH/IR stars however suggest that these stars may support only weakly
   saturated SiO masers, without significant competitive gain on maser
   propagation. There is a striking correspondence between results reported
   here and VLBI data reported in Miyoshi et al. 1994, published shortly
   after this work was submitted for publication.},

Pages = {469-491},
Abstract = {We report on high spectral resolution observations of the 4 mu m SiO
   first overtone bands in six late-type M giants (M5-8III) and two M
   supergiants. For M supergiants as well as for M5-6 giants, line
   intensities and profiles of most (SiO)-Si-28 lines can be understood by
   a unique set of silicon abundance, micro-and macro-turbulence, once a
   model atmosphere is specified by a T-eff which is confirmed by angular
   diameter measurement. In the latest M giants (M7-8III), strong lines of
   (SiO)-Si-28 show excess emission over the predictions based on classical
   model atmospheres. We suggest that emission of SiO from the outer
   atmosphere fills in the photospheric absorption.
   Many resolved lines and band heads due to (29)Si0 and (SiO)-Si-30 can be
   clearly identified in all the late M giant spectra surveyed. Silicon
   isotopic ratios are determined by the analysis of the well isolated weak
   absorption features, including doublet features due to the returning
   R-branch. A reasonable number of weak spectral lines for use as
   abundance indicators were found for each isotopic species. Si-28/Si-29
   and Si-28/Si-30 have approximately the terrestrial values but more
   neutron-rich nuclei tend to be more abundant. Si-29/Si-30 has slightly
   less than the terrestrial value of 1.51 in all the M giants surveyed.
   Similar analysis turned out to be more difficult in M supergiants, but
   Si-28/Si-29 shows the same tendency as in M giants.
   Information on silicon isotopic ratios outside the solar system is still
   meager. Our results suggest that the silicon isotopic ratios may not be
   necessarily homogeneous throughout the Galaxy, possibly reflecting
   different contributions of types I and II supernovae.},

Pages = {953-970},
Abstract = {A model for the excitation and emission of SiO masers in evolved stars,
   that includes a non-local treatment of the radiative transfer, is
   presented. The approximations made and their effects, the sources of
   numerical noise, and in general the reliability of the model are
   discussed. The code is shown to give an important amount of information
   on the theoretical expectations for SiO maser emission. The masers are
   supposed to be placed in an inner quasi-stationary layer of the
   circumstellar envelope, the properties of which are discussed in view of
   the available information. The numerical predictions are generally in
   good agreement with the observational data. In particular, the
   calculated intensity attains the measured level for a wide range of
   physical conditions. The maser pump is found to be dominantly radiative,
   acting through the DELTAv=1 SiO vibrational transitions. Collisional
   pump is also possible, but probably gives only a marginal contribution
   to the total maser output. The radiative maser pump naturally explains
   the observed dependence of the maser intensity on the stellar infrared
   continuum, both from object to object and during the stellar variability
   cycle. However some observational features, like the well known low
   intensity of the v=2 J=2-1 line and the possible spatial coincidence of
   the J=1-0 v=1 and v=2 masers, are not reproduced by the numerical
   results; possible explanations to this disagreement are discussed. This

Abstract = {We have observed the v = 1 J = 2 --> 1 SiO maser transition in the late

   occultation of this source. Significant power fluctuations (Fresnel
   fringes) were recorded with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-30 at
   immersion and emersion of the source over the full velocity range of the
   maser emission. The data sampling rate was of 50 ms which provides an
   angular resolution of congruent-to 25 mas for the velocities of the
   strong masers and of congruent-to 50 mas in the line wings. The restored
   brightness distribution is consistent with a source of 60 mas in
   diameter (1.1 x 10(14) cm for a distance of 120 pc which corresponds to
   a diameter of 4 stellar radii). The observed velocity field for the ps
   between 1 and 2 stellar radii could fit a rotating structure
   (disk/ring/spherical shell). The velocity field derived for the line
   wings suggests a bipolar mass loss from the star, extending at least
   over 8 stellar radii. High sensitivity observations of several SiO maser
   transitions in R Leo show emission at velocities larger than the
   expanding velocity of the external molecular envelope. These maser
   clumps are probably arising from the bipolar outflow observed in the
   lunar occultations. This is the first time that lunar occultations at
   millimeter wavelengths provide the maximum angular resolution

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {261},
Pages = {522-534},
Abstract = {Spectra at 8-13 mum of SN 1987A, obtained on 12 dates between days 54
   and 850 after the explosion, are presented. Emission lines from hydrogen
   trace the development of the expanding ejecta from an optically thick to
   an optically thin nebula, followed by the recombination of the hydrogen
   envelope. Fine-structure lines of heavy elements, which dominated the
   spectrum between days 300 and 550, are analysed to derive masses of
   cobalt and chlorine which are in good agreement with model predictions.
   An upper limit to the ratio of Co-57 to Co-56 of 1.6 times the solar
   Fe-57 to-Fe-56 ratio is derived, which is also in good agreement with
   models, but precludes the possibility that enhanced Co-57 Could account
   for a high bolometric luminosity at late times. The ionization balance
   of the heavy elements shifted from greater than or similar to 90 per
   cent singly ionized at the end of the first year to greater than or
   similar to 50 per cent neutral by day 600. This recombination, coupled
   with the expansion of the ejecta and the decaying radioactive energy
   input, caused the density to fall below the critical density of the
   mid-infrared transitions (approximately 10(6) cm-3) around day 530, and
   the emission lines faded rapidly after that date. Emission from the
   fundamental vibration-rotation band of silicon monoxide, which had been
   present from at least day 160, also weakened close to this time, and was
   not detected on day 578. Emission from dust started to make a
   substantial contribution to the mid-infrared spectrum near day 400,
   increasing steadily in intensity until it peaked near day 580. Beyond
   this time, the 10-mum continuum flux faded as the dust cooled, but the
   derived dust mass remained approximately constant at about 5 x 10(-4) M.
   The dust emission spectrum showed no evidence of strong spectral
   structure in the 8-13 mum region, but between days 500 and 580 was
   steeper than a blackbody curve, requiring emission from grains whose
   emissivity falls at least as steeply as lambda-1. This implies that the
   emission was optically thin and that some of the emitting grains must
   have subtended an angle larger than that defined by the ejecta
   travelling at 2000 km s-1. However, it is clear that the bulk of the
   dust must have formed in the ejecta and that at most only a small
   fraction of the mid-infrared emission could have arisen from an infrared
   echo.},

Abstract = {Dipole moments of SiO, GeO, SnO, PbO, and of the corresponding sulfieds
   are computed by using a variety of high-level correlated methods and
   polarized basis sets of Gaussian functions. The contribution of
   relativistic effects has been accounted for by the first-order
   quasirelativistic approach based on mass-velocity and Darwin terms. The
   results for sulfides are in good agreement with experiment while for
   oxides seem to show a progressive deterioration with the increase of the
   heavy atom nuclear charge. The discrepancies between the calculated and
   experimental dipole moments for oxides have been carefully analyzed for
   the PbO molecule in terms of the basis set choice and reliability of the
   calculated electron correlation and relativistic corrections. The
   pattern of relativistic corrections computed in the present study is
   compared with that which follows from recent quasirelativistic and fully
   relativistic calculations of Dyall. Some complementary calculations of
   the dipole moment of PbSe and PbTe seem to indicate that both the
   polarized basis sets and computational methods used in this study should
   not fail to predict correct values of the dipole moment of PbO and other
   oxides of the group IVa atoms. The rather unexpected discrepancies have
   no plausible explanation within the range of methods employed in our

   molecular calculations at the correlated level of approximation.},

Title = {MODELING SIO MASER EMISSION FROM LATE-TYPE STARS},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {1992},
Volume = {399},
Pages = {704-713},
Abstract = {We have performed a thorough study of both radiative and collisional
   pumping of the SiO masers around late-type stars, carefully considering
   the combined and separate actions of each type of pump in order to gauge
   its effectiveness. We find that collisional pumping is severely
   underestimated when the model calculations use a small number (less than
   about 18) of rotational levels in each vibrational state. We have
   developed a procedure that corrects this problem and gives results that
   are nearly independent of the number of levels utilized in the
   calculations. We recognize, but do not solve, an important problem that
   afflicts all escape probability treatments which include maser
   saturation effects on the level populations. Maser radiation is strongly
   beamed and the functional form of the beaming angle must be known to
   properly calculate the maser escape probability. However, the beam
   pattern for saturated masers in the presence of large velocity gradients
   has yet to be studied in the literature.
   Our model is based on observations and theoretical arguments that place
   the SiO masers in high-density clumps rather than in the smooth stellar
   wind. Significantly, general conclusions can be reached which are
   independent of the pumping mechanism. Most importantly, the overall
   molecular density is restricted to lie between approximately
   10(9)-10(10) cm-3, regardless of the type of pumping. In addition, both
   collisional and radiative pumps result in the production of a maser
   chain within each vibrational state, as observed. There are some
   important differences, however, between the pumping mechanisms. All
   pumps based on stellar radiation become less efficient with distance
   from the star because of the rapid decline in pump rate. This prevents
   any radiative pump from being able to produce the observed maser
   emission over most of the observed maser region. The only feasible
   radiative pumps require fine tuning of physical conditions and produce
   inversion only over a narrow range of optical depths that depends
   sensitively on the size of the velocity gradient and the form of the
   escape probability expression. In addition, these radiative pumps have
   difficulty in explaining the simultaneous production of masers in the
   same rotational transitions of adjacent vibrational states as is
   observed. We find that collisional pumping produces the strongest maser
   emission and, in contrast to radiative pumping, generates maser
   radiation over the entire observed region and does not require fine
   tuning of the physical parameters for its operation. Furthermore, there
   is a significant range of overlapping column densities where collisional
   pumping produces maser emission in the same rotational transitions of
   adjacent vibrational states, as observed. Collisional pumping thus
   appears to be the primary pumping mechanism responsible for the SiO
   maser phenomenon.},

Journal = AJ,

Pages = {2045-2052},
Abstract = {We describe first efforts to establish a network of calibrated infrared
   spectra of ``standard stars{''} suitable for calibration of at least
   low-resolution infrared spectrometers using ground-based, airborne, and
   satellite-borne broadband sensors. The focus of this paper is on the
   crucial 5-8 mum region, inaccessible from the ground, in K and M giants.
   In this region the fundamental bands of CO and SiO cause substantial
   departures from featureless pseudo-continua. These departures are, of
   course, well-known to stellar atmosphere theorists. However, they are
   still ignored by many astronomical infrared photometrists and
   spectroscopists who assume that these bright stars can be represented by
   blackbodies at their effective temperatures. The purpose of this short
   paper is to draw the attention of infrared observers in the field to the
   invalidity of the blackbody assumption in the thermal infrared regime.
   We hope to achieve this end by observationally demonstrating the
   importance of these molecular features in cool giant stars in the
   airborne infrared regime, and illustrating their influence on spectra
   that are calibrated using blackbody assumptions. To help confirm our
   identifications of the principal molecular features, we present a
   synthetic spectrum computed using a model atmosphere with the
   approximate parameters of alpha Tau. This theoretical synthetic
   spectrum, which contains line opacity only from CO and SiO, reproduces
   the observed spectrum of alpha Tau to within a few percent.},

   examples, RX Boo, R Cas, chi-Cyg, and IK Tau, the flux distribution has
   circular symmetry. The observations of the other objects are also
   compatible with this geometry. The linear radii, at half power, of the
   SiO emitting regions in the O-rich and S-type Miras range from 1 to 7
   10(15) cm. Such sizes are larger than those adopted in recent models for
   SiO thermal emission, but much smaller than CO diameters. For
   supergiants and IRC+10216, the emitting regions are larger than for
   O-rich Miras.
   Except for IRC+10216, the source diameters do not vary with radial
   velocity. This is not the behaviour expected for envelopes expanding
   with an almost constant velocity, Which would have a clear maximum at
   the central velocities, and shows that the terminal velocity is not yet
   attained at distances of the order of 5 10(15) cm from the star. We
   suggest that such a phenomenon is due to grain formation extending over
   a region comparable to the SiO emitting shell, which is much larger than

Abstract = {We present the first detection of strong maser emission from high J
   rotational transitions of the first vibrational excited state of
   (SiO)-Si-29.  Within the v = 1 level the only rational line showing
   strong maser emission is the J = 4-3.  We have reached very low upper
   limits for the emission of the J = 2-1, J = 3-2 (except in VY CMa where
   this line has been detected), and J = 5-4 lines of the same vibrational
   level towards all the stars in our sample.  This result could be
   understood as due to opacity effects if the maser intensity ratios R45 =
   T(B)(J = 4-3)/T(B)(J = 5-4) and R43 = T(B)(J = 4-3)/T(B)(J = 3-2) were
   only of almost-equal-to 2-3.  However, the upper limits to the emission
   from the J = 5-4 line give R45 > 20-100 in all the observed stars.
   Similar results apply also to the ratios of the J = 4-3 to the J = 2-1

   ratio R43 is of the order of unity.
   We propose that the thermal overlap of the infrared lines of (SiO)-Si-28

   the (SiO)-Si-29 masers in the v = 1 state.  Infrared overlaps between

Abstract = {The laser excitation spectra of several bands of the A 1-PI-X 1-SIGMA+
   system of SiO produced in a glow discharge and an atmospheric pressure
   flame have been observed.  Spectral simulations were used to assign and
   extract temperatures from the congested excitation spectra.  Resolved
   fluorescence measurements gave an estimate of the ratio of the rates of
   vibrational energy transfer and electronic quenching in the A state and
   indicate that the A-X transition moment shows a strong variation as a
   function of r-centroid.},

Title = {THE MILLIMETER-WAVE SPECTRUM OF HIGHLY VIBRATIONALLY EXCITED SIO},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {1991},
Volume = {368},
Pages = {L19-L22},
Abstract = {The millimeter-wave rotational spectra of SiO in high vibrational states
   (v = 0-40) in its electronic ground (chi1-sigma-+) state were measured
   between 228 and 347 GHz in a laboratory discharge through SiH4 and CO.
   On ascending the vibrational ladder, populations decline precipitously
   for the first few levels, with a vibrational temperature of about 1000
   K; at v almost-equal-to 3, however, they markedly flatten out, and from
   there to v almost-equal-to 40 the temperature is of the order of 10,000
   K.  With the Dunham coefficients determined here, the rotational
   spectrum of highly vibrationally excited SiO can now be calculated into
   the far-infrared to accuracies required for radioastronomy (i.e.,
   greater-than-or-similar-to 1 km s-1).  Possible astronomical sources of
   highly vibrationally excited SiO are certain stellar atmospheres,
   ultracompact H II regions, very young supernova ejecta, and dense
   interstellar shocks.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE},
Year = {1991},

Pages = {147-162},
Abstract = {The potential energy curve and the bond-length dependence of the
   electric properties for SiO and its anion are calculated using ab initio
   MO methods.  The static and frequency-dependent polarizabilities are
   evaluated directly from the large CI Hamiltonian matrix without the
   explicit knowledge of the eigenvectors of the matrix.  Two states of the
   anion SiO- (2-SIGMA+ and 2-PI) lie closely by the ground state
   X(1)-SIGMA+ of SiO.  The equilibrium internuclear distance R(e) of the
   2-SIGMA+ state is nearly equal to that of the X(1)-SIGMA+ SiO state,
   while the R(e) of the 2-PI state is substantially longer than the
   latter.  The electron affinity is estimated to be negative or nearly
   zero.  The bond-length dependence of the dipole moment, the quadrupole
   moment and the polarizability tensor is expected to be remarkably
   different among three states X(1)-SIGMA+, 2-PI and 2-SIGMA+.},

   these and have not included obviously nonstellar sources such as Orion
   A.  The catalog includes basic information about the stars including
   alternate names, the 1950 epoch position, velocity (LSR), spectral type,
   variability type, and period, as well as the references for both the
   detections and nondetections for each of the three molecules.},

   states of the SiO molecule}},

Abstract = {{The potential energy curves (PECs) of the X-1 Sigma(+), a(3)Sigma(+),
   A(1)Pi and C-1 Sigma(-) electronic states of the SiO molecule are
   studied using an ab initio quantum chemical method. The calculations
   have been made employing the complete active space self-consistent field
   (CASSCF) method, which is followed by the valence internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach in combination
   with several correlation-consistent basis sets. The effect on the PECs
   by the core-valence correlation and relativistic corrections is
   included. The way to consider the relativistic correction is to use the
   third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation. The core-valence
   correlation correction is carried out with the cc-pCVQZ basis set, and
   the relativistic correction is performed at the level of the cc-pVQZ
   basis set. To obtain more reliable results, the PECs determined by the
   MRCI calculations are also corrected for size-extensivity errors by
   means of the Davidson modification (MRCI + Q). The PECs of these
   electronic states are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit by
   the total-energy extrapolation scheme. Employing these PECs, the
   spectroscopic parameters are calculated and compared with those reported
   in the literature. With these PECs determined by the MRCI + Q/CV + DK +
   56 calculations, by solving the radial Schrodinger equation of nuclear
   motion, 110 vibrational states for the X-1 Sigma(+), 69 for the
   a(3)Sigma(+), 54 for the A(1)Pi and 67 for the C-1 Sigma(-) electronic
   state are predicted when the rotational quantum number J equals zero.
   The vibrational manifolds of the first 20 vibrational states are
   reported and compared with the available RKR data for each electronic
   state. On the whole, as expected, the most accurate spectroscopic
   parameters and molecular constants of the SiO molecule are obtained by
   the MRCI + QJCV + DK + 56 calculations. And the present molecular
   constants of the a(3)Sigma(+), C-1 Sigma(-) and A(1)Pi electronic states
   determined by the MRCI + QJCV + DK + 56 calculations should be good
   prediction for future laboratory experiment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{VAPORIZATION OF THE EARTH: APPLICATION TO EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{755}},
pages = {41},
Abstract = {{Currently, there are about three dozen known super-Earths (M < 10
   M-circle plus), of which eight are transiting planets suitable for
   atmospheric follow-up observations. Some of the planets are exposed to
   extreme temperatures as they orbit close to their host stars, e. g.,
   CoRot-7b, and all of these planets have equilibrium temperatures
   significantly hotter than the Earth. Such planets can develop
   atmospheres through (partial) vaporization of their crustal and/or
   mantle silicates. We investigated the chemical equilibrium composition
   of such heated systems from 500 to 4000 K and total pressures from
   10(-6) to 10(+2) bars. The major gases are H2O and CO2 over broad
   temperature and pressure ranges, and Na, K, O-2, SiO, and O at high
   temperatures and low pressures. We discuss the differences in
   atmospheric composition arising from vaporization of SiO2-rich (i.e.,
   felsic) silicates (like Earth's continental crust) and MgO-, FeO-rich
   (i.e., mafic) silicates (like the bulk silicate Earth). The
   computational results will be useful in planning spectroscopic studies
   of the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets.}}}
