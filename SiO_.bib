  abstract = {Accurate rotational-vibrational line lists are calculated for silicon
	monoxide. Line lists are presented for the main isotopologue, (SiO)-Si-28-O-16,
	and for four monosubstituted isotopologues ((SiO)-Si-29-O-16, (SiO)-Si-30-O-16,
	(SiO)-Si-28-O-18 and (SiO)-Si-28-O-17), in their ground electronic
	states. These line lists are suitable for high temperatures (up to
	9000 K), including those relevant to exoplanetary atmospheres and
	cool stars. A combination of empirical and ab initio methods is used:
	the potential energy curves are determined to high accuracy by fitting
	to extensive data from the analysis of both laboratory and sunspot
	spectra; a high-quality ab initio dipole moment curve is calculated
	at the large basis set, multireference configuration interaction
	level. A partition function plus full line lists of rotational-vibrational
	transitions are made available in an electronic form as Supplementary
