	reference wavefunction is examined, with particular emphasis on the
	case of spin-restricted open shell reference states. By considering
	the perturbation expansions of the true and CCSD energies, expressions
	are derived which give a perturbative correction for the effects
	of triple excitations which is consistent to fifth order. The resulting
	Ansatz, denoted CCSD-T, differs from the standard CCSD(T) correction
	even in the case where Brillouin's theorem holds, and ought to be
	superior, since it correctly includes more disconnected triples terms
	up to fifth order. This assertion is investigated by test calculations,
	which show that both methods deliver accurate results for both closed

  abstract = {{For molecules containing second row atoms, unacceptable errors have
	been found in extrapolating dissociation energies calculated with
	the standard correlation consistent basis sets to the complete basis
	set limit. By carefully comparing the convergence behavior of De(O2)
	and De(SO), we show that the cause of these errors is a result of
	two inter-related problems: near duplication of the exponents in
	two of the d sets and a lack of high-exponent functions in the early
	members of the sets. Similar problems exist for the f sets (and probably
	in higher angular momentum sets), but have only a minor effect on
	the calculated dissociation energies. A number of approaches to address
	the problems in the d sets were investigated. Well behaved convergence
	was obtained by augmenting the (1d) and (2d) sets with a high-exponent
	function and by replacing the (3d) set by the (4d) set and the (4d)
	set by the (5d) set and so on. To ensure satisfactory coverage of
	both the L and M shell regions, the exponents of the new d sets were
	re-optimized. Benchmark calculations on Si2, PN, SO, and AlCl with
	the new cc-pV(n+d)Z sets show greatly improved convergence behavior

Title = {{Conformers of Gaseous Cysteine}},
Journal = {J. Comput. Chem. Theory},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {1511-1523},
Abstract = {{Structures, accurate relative energies, equilibrium and vibrationally
   averaged rotational constants, quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion
   constants, dipole moments, N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants,
   anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and double-harmonic infrared
   intensities have been determined from ab initio electronic structure
   computations for conformers of the neutral form of the natural amino
   acid L-cysteine (Cys). A systematic scan located 71 unique conformers of
   Cys using the MP2(FC)/cc-pVTZ method. The large number of structurally
   diverse low-energy conformers of Cys necessitates the highest possible
   levels of electronic structure theory to determine their relative
   energies with some certainty. For this reason, we determined the
   relative energies of the lowest-energy eleven conformers, accurate
   within a standard error (11 or) of about 0.3 kJ mol(-1), through
   first-principles composite focal-point analyses (FPA), which employed
   extrapolations using basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z and
   correlation treatments as extensive as CCSD(T). Three and eleven
   conformers Of L-cysteine fall within a relative energy of 6 and 10 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. The vibrationally averaged rotational constants
   computed in this study agree well with Fourier-transform microwave
   spectroscopy results. The effects determining the relative energies of
   the low-energy conformers of cysteine are analyzed in detail on the
   basis of hydrogen bond additivity schemes and natural bond orbital
   analysis.}},

  journal = JCP,
  year = {{2002}},
  volume = {{117}},
  pages = {10548},
  abstract = {{Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core--core
	and core--valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have
	been developed for the second row atoms Al--Ar. Two different optimization
	strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core--valence
	basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard
	correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the
	exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized
	with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence--electron
	correlated calculations, i.e., for the core--core plus core--valence
	correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets,
	which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first
	row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103,
	4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence
	to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set
	limit, the intershell (core--valence) correlation energy converges
	more slowly than the intrashell (core--core) correlation energy.
	Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation
	of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core--valence correlation
	effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions
	was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions
	to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just
	the core--valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a
	small amount of core--core correlation energy was included in order
	to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit.
	These new sets, denoted weighted core--valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ),
	significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties
	with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also
	developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ
	basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations
	on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al2, Si2,
	P2, S2, and Cl2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving
	first row atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the calculation of core
	correlation effects on energetic and spectroscopic properties, the
	cc-pwCVnZ basis sets are recommended over the cc-pCVnZ ones.}}

Volume = {2},
Pages = {273-289},
Abstract = {An anharmonic force field is defined as a higher-order Taylor-series
expansion of the molecular potential energy surface (PES) around a 
reference geometry, usually chosen to be an equilibrium structure. Force
field expansions provide excellent local approximations to PESs, one of
the most important theoretical constructs of chemistry. This review
deals principally with the definition and physical interpretation of
anharmonic molecular force fields, their determination via techniques of
electronic structure theory, their transformation among different
rectilinear and curvilinear representations, and their utilization.
Physical and technical factors leading to more precise and more accurate
force fields are also discussed. (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
