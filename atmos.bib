Abstract = {{MIPAS, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding, is
   a mid-infrared emission spectrometer which is part of the core payload
   of ENVISAT. It is a limb sounder, i.e. it scans across the horizon
   detecting atmospheric spectral radiances which are inverted to vertical
   temperature, trace species and cloud distributions. These data can be
   used for scientific investigations in various research fields including
   dynamics and chemistry in the altitude region between upper troposphere
   and lower thermosphere.
   The instrument is a well calibrated and characterized Fourier transform
   spectrometer which is able to detect many trace constituents
   simultaneously. The different concepts of retrieval methods are
   described including multi-target and two-dimensional retrievals.
   Operationally generated data sets consist of temperature, H2O, O-3, CH4,
   N2O, HNO3, and NO2 profiles. Measurement errors are investigated in
   detail and random and systematic errors are specified. The results are
   validated by independent instrumentation which has been operated at
   ground stations or aboard balloon gondolas and aircraft.
   Intercomparisons of MIPAS measurements with other satellite data have
   been carried out, too. As a result, it has been proven that the MIPAS
   data are of good quality.
   MIPAS can be operated in different measurement modes in order to
   optimize the scientific output. Due to the wealth of information in the
   MIPAS spectra, many scientific results have already been published. They
   include intercomparisons of temperature distributions with ECMWF data,
   the derivation of the whole NOy family, the study of atmospheric
   processes during the Antarctic vortex split in September 2002, the
   determination of properties of Polar Stratospheric Clouds, the downward
   transport of NOx in the middle atmosphere, the stratosphere-troposphere
   exchange, the influence of solar variability on the middle atmosphere,
   and the observation of Non-LTE effects in the mesosphere.}}}

Abstract = {{SCISAT-1, also known as the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment ( ACE), is
   a Canadian satellite mission for remote sensing of the Earth's
   atmosphere. It was launched into low Earth circular orbit ( altitude 650
   km, inclination 74 degrees) on 12 Aug. 2003. The primary ACE instrument
   is a high spectral resolution (0.02 cm(-1)) Fourier Transform
   Spectrometer (FTS) operating from 2.2 to 13.3 mm ( 750 - 4400 cm(-1)).
   The satellite also features a dual spectrophotometer known as MAESTRO
   with wavelength coverage of 285 - 1030 nm and spectral resolution of 1 -
   2 nm. A pair of filtered CMOS detector arrays records images of the Sun
   at 0.525 and 1.02 mu m. Working primarily in solar occultation, the
   satellite provides altitude profile information ( typically 10 - 100 km)
   for temperature, pressure, and the volume mixing ratios for several
   dozen molecules of atmospheric interest, as well as atmospheric
   extinction profiles over the latitudes 85 degrees N to 85 degrees S.
   This paper presents a mission overview and some of the first scientific
   results.}},
