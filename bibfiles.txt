Notes on formatting and name of bib files in our communial area
Please try to keep them to minimise errors, duplications and latex crashes.

March 2018



For the @Article the following fields are required:

author: 
1. Both the format 
J.  Tennyson AND A.  {van der Avoird}
or 
Tennyson, J. and van der Avoird, A
are acceptable but in the former, multiword surname must be surrounded by {braces}. Do not use braces otherwise. Convert all capital forms into correct upper/lower case format.
2. Initials must be separated by a space in both formats.

title:
Best to use correct upper and lower case and surround by {{double braces}}

journal:
Where possible use simple name given in journal_astro.bib and journal_phys.bib files in the form:
journal=MNRAS
otherwise uses standard abbreviation with correct upper/lower case letters.
This form allows journal names to properly resolved for astronomy and
physics/chemistry journals which used different naming conventions and
facilitates the use of other conventions.

year

volume

pages:
1. This may be given as article-number, eid or some other varient. Rename as pages in all cases. Include end page if possible (but not for article-numbers).
2. pages MUST be surrounded by {single braces}. Use of {{double braces}} crashes most bibstyles.

The following are to be encouraged:

doi 
Give this in the reduced form eg doi = {10.1063/1.444316}
not as a fully qualified web address

abstract

keywords

The following should be removed/deleted:
month
number
url

Other fields are usually best deleted but are not generally significant.

For other type (@inproceedings, @book, etc) use similar rules.

Naming conventions

There is no single naming convention in use. Instead they are by folder.
Please follow them to avoid duplication and multiple citatioos of the same
paper.

folder jt   entries named jtn where n is the number of the article on the
     webpage 
 http://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/amopp/people/jonathan_tennyson/papers
so paper 659
is jt 659


folder exomol  entries should be named as follows:
        First 2 characters the year eg 18
        Next  2 digits first 2 characters of first  author surname
        Next  2 digits first 2 characters of second author surname
        Next  2 digits first 2 characters of third  author surname.
If single author use first six characters of authors name
If two authors (or first author name less than 6 characters) pad with x's
then a full stop
then chemical formula of the molcules.
Eg

Author = {Karthikeyan, B. and Rajamanickam, N. and Bagare, S. P.},
Title = {On the Rotational Temperature of AlH in Sunspots},
Year = {2010},
is denoted  10KaRaBa.AlH,

while 


Author = {Halfen, D. T. and Ziurys, L. M.},
Title = {{THz SPECTROSCOPY OF AlH (X (1)Sigma(+)): DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF THE J=2
   <- 1 TRANSITION}},
Year = {{2014}},
is denoted 14HaZixx.AlH

Author = {Cobos, C J},
Title = {Heats of formation for AlH, AlOH, OAlH and OAlOH and their monocations},
Year = {2002},
should be 02Cobosx.AlH but may be given as 02Coxxxx.AlH

folder RmatReact (broadly) follows the exomol conventions.


folder MARVEL uses the IUPAC convention which is similar to exomol but not
quite the same

        First 2 characters the year eg 18
        Next  2 digits first 2 characters of first  author surname
repeat for up to four (not three authors)
Single author papers use full name (up to first 8 characters)
Do not pad with xx's.

eg 
author = {A.-W. Liu AND K.-F. Song AND H.-Y. Ni AND S.-M. Hu AND O.~V. Naumenko AND I.~A. Vasilenko AND S.~N. Mikhailenko},
title = {{(0~0~0) and (0~1~0) energy levels of the HD$^{18}$O and D$_2$$^{18}$O molecules from analysis of their $\nu_2$ bands}},
year  = {2011},
is denoted 11LiSoNiHu

Other folders have less well defined naming conventions.
