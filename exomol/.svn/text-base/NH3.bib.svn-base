Abstract = {{Eleven instruments for the measurement of ambient concentrations of
   atmospheric ammonia gas (NH(3)), based on eight different measurement
   methods were inter-compared above an intensively managed agricultural
   field in late summer 2008 in Southern Scotland. To test the instruments
   over a wide range of concentrations, the field was fertilised with urea
   midway through the experiment, leading to an increase in the average
   concentration from 10 to 100 ppbv. The instruments deployed included
   three wet-chemistry systems, one with offline analysis (annular rotating
   batch denuder, RBD) and two with online-analysis (Annular Denuder
   sampling with online Analysis, AMANDA; AiRRmonia), two Quantum Cascade
   Laser Absorption Spectrometers (a large-cell dual system; DUAL-QCLAS,
   and a compact system; c-QCLAS), two photo-acoustic spectrometers
   (WaSul-Flux; Nitrolux-100), a Cavity Ring Down Spectrosmeter (CRDS), a
   Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), an ion mobility
   spectrometer (IMS) and an OpenPath Fourier Transform Infra-Red (OP-FTIR)
   Spectrometer. The instruments were compared with each other and with the
   average concentration of all instruments. An overall good agreement of
   hourly average concentrations between the instruments (R(2)>0.84), was
   observed for NH(3) concentrations at the field of up to 120 ppbv with
   the slopes against the average ranging from 0.67 (DUAL-QCLAS) to 1.13
   (AiRRmonia) with intercepts of -0.74 ppbv (RBD) to + 2.69 ppbv (CIMS).
   More variability was found for performance for lower concentrations(<10
   ppbv). Here the main factors affecting measurement precision are (a) the
   inlet design, (b) the state of inlet filters (where applicable), and (c)
   the quality of gas-phase standards (where applicable). By reference to
   the fast (1 Hz) instruments deployed during the study, it was possible
   to characterize the response times of the slower instruments.}},

Title = {{NEAR-INFRARED PHOTOMETRY OF Y DWARFS: LOW AMMONIA ABUNDANCE AND THE
   ONSET OF WATER CLOUDS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{799}},
Abstract = {{We present new near-infrared photometry for seven late-type T dwarfs and
   nine Y-type dwarfs, and lower limit magnitudes for a tenth Y dwarf,
   obtained at Gemini Observatory. We also present a reanalysis of H-band
   imaging data from the Keck Observatory Archive, for an 11th Y dwarf.
   These data are combined with earlier MKO-system photometry, Spitzer and
   WISE mid-infrared photometry, and available trigonometric parallaxes, to
   create a sample of late-type brown dwarfs that includes 10 T9-T9.5
   dwarfs or dwarf systems, and 16 Y dwarfs. We compare the data to our
   models, which include updated H-2 and NH3 opacity, as well as
   low-temperature condensate clouds. The models qualitatively reproduce
   the trends seen in the observed colors; however, there are discrepancies
   of around a factor of two in flux for the Y0-Y1 dwarfs, with T-eff
   approximate to 350-400 K. At T-eff similar to 400 K, the problems could
   be addressed by significantly reducing the NH3 absorption, for example
   by halving the abundance of NH3 possibly by vertical mixing. At T-eff
   similar to 350 K, the discrepancy may be resolved by incorporating thick
   water clouds. The onset of these clouds might occur over a narrow range
   in T-eff, as indicated by the observed small change in 5 mu m flux over
   a large change in J -W2 color. Of the known Y dwarfs, the reddest in
   J-W2 are WISEP J182831.08 + 265037.8 and WISE J085510.83-071442.5. We
   interpret the former as a pair of identical 300-350 K dwarfs, and the
   latter as a 250 K dwarf. If these objects are similar to 3 Gyr old,
   their masses are similar to 10 and similar to 5 Jupiter-masses,
   respectively.}},

   the environment and human health, including an assessment of the
   magnitude of different environmental problems, and the relative
   importance of Nr as a contributor to each problem. In some cases, Nr
   loss to the environment is the key driver of effects (e.g. terrestrial

   were retrieved by fitting individual spectra based on a Voigt line shape
   profile and then averaging the values to form the experimental linelist.
   The integrated intensity of the region was 4.68 x 10(-19)

   also estimated for 3567 absorption line features using line intensities
   retrieved from 10 spectra recorded at gas temperature between 185 and

   the empirical lower state energy estimates, the quantum assignments were
   determined for 1096 transitions in the room temperature linelist, along
   with empirical upper state energies for 434 levels. The assignments
   correspond to seven vibrational states, as confirmed from recent ab

   potential energy surface used with nonadiabatic corrections},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
Abstract = {In this work, we build upon our previous work on the theoretical
   spectroscopy of ammonia, NH(3). Compared to our 2008 study, we include
   more physics in our rovibrational calculations and more experimental
   data in the refinement procedure, and these enable us to produce a
   potential energy surface (PES) of unprecedented accuracy. We call this
   the HSL-2 PES. The additional physics we include is a second-order
   correction for the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and
   we find it to be critical for improved results. By including
   experimental data for higher rotational levels in the refinement
   procedure, we were able to greatly reduce our systematic errors for the
   rotational dependence of our predictions. These additions together lead
   to a significantly improved total angular momentum (J) dependence in our
   computed rovibrational energies. The root-mean-square error between our
   predictions using the HSL-2 PES and the reliable energy levels from the
   HITRAN database for J = 0-6 and J = 7/8 for (14)NH(3) is only 0.015
   cm(-1) and 0.020/0.023 cm(-1), respectively. The root-mean-square errors
   for the characteristic inversion splittings are approximately 1/3
   smaller than those for energy levels. The root-mean-square error for the
   6002 J = 0-8 transition energies is 0.020 cm(-1). Overall, for J = 0-8,
   the spectroscopic data computed with HSL-2 is roughly an order of
   magnitude more accurate relative to our previous best ammonia PES
   (denoted HSL-1). These impressive numbers are eclipsed only by the
   root-mean-square error between our predictions for purely rotational
   transition energies of (15)NH(3) and the highly accurate Cologne
   database (CDMS): 0.00034 cm(-1) (10 MHz), in other words, 2 orders of
   magnitude smaller. In addition, we identify a deficiency in the
   (15)NH(3) energy levels determined from a model of the experimental
   data. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3541351]},

Abstract = {Several aspects of ammonia rovibrational spectra have been investigated
   using the new HSL-2 potential energy surface that includes an
   approximate correction for nonadiabatic effects. The unprecedented
   accuracy of rovibrational energy levels and transition energies computed
   using HSL-2 was demonstrated in Part I of this study. For (NH3)-N-14,
   new assignments for a few nu(3) + nu(4) band transitions and energy
   levels are suggested, and discrepancies between computed and HITRAN
   energy levels in the 2 nu(4) band are analyzed (2 nu(4) is the most
   difficult band below 5000 cm (1)). New assignments are suggested for
   existing or missing 2 nu(4) levels. Several new vibrational bands are
   identified from existing, unassigned HITRAN data, including 2 nu(2) +
   nu(4), (nu(3) + nu(4)) -A'/A `', nu(1) + 2 nu(2), and 2 nu(2) + 2 nu(4).
   The strong mixing between the 2 nu(4) and 2 nu(2) + nu(4) bands is
   carefully examined and found to be the source of the difficulties in the
   experimental modeling of 2 nu(4). Discussion is presented for
   preliminary J = 10 results, where the overall root-mean-square error is
   estimated to be less than 0.039 cm(-1). The analysis of the 4 nu(2) band
   demonstrates both the reliability and the accuracy of predictions from
   HSL-2. The full list of computed J = 0 band origins (with assignments)
   and the inversion splittings up to 7000-8000 cm(-1) above the zero-point
   energy are presented. J = 0-2 levels are reported for those bands below
   5100 cm(-1) that are missing from the HITRAN database. For (NH3)-N-15,
   excellent agreement is found for the available nu(2) and nu(3) +
   nu(4)(E) transition energies, but significant deficiencies are shown for
   HITRAN levels and several corrections are suggested. The N-15 isotopic
   effects are presented for the J = 0-6 levels of 13 HITRAN bands. For
   (ND3)-N-14, we reproduce the pure rotational inversion spectra line
   frequencies with an accuracy similar to that for (NH3)-N-14. However, it
   is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all four pairs of
   inversion-split vibrational fundamentals to better than 0.05 cm(-1)
   uncertainty. It is suggested that a reanalysis of some suspicious
   (ND3)-N-14 fundamental bands is required. The analyses presented here
   and in Part I show that rovibrational energy levels and transition
   frequencies computed with HSL-2 (with nonadiabatic corrections) remain
   highly accurate well beyond the experimental data used in the refinement
   procedure. Calculations using HSL-2 are capable of revealing many
   deficiencies in experimental analyses of ammonia spectra and provide
   reliable predictions with similar accuracy. It is expected that the
   results of this study will be useful in the future interpretation of
   high-resolution spectra from laboratory experiments or from astronomical
   observations. The present work represents a very significant advance in
   the state of our knowledge of the spectroscopy of ammonia and its
   isotopologues. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

 abstreact = {Complete and reliable knowledge of the ammonia spectrum is needed to enable the analysis and interpretation of astrophysical and planetary observations. Ammonia has been observed in the interstellar medium up to J = 18 and more highly excited transitions are expected to appear in hot exoplanets and brown dwarfs. As a result, there is considerable interest in observing and assigning the high J (rovibrational) spectrum. In this work, numerous spectroscopic techniques were employed to study its high J transitions in the ground and nu(2) = 1 states. Measurements were carried out using a frequency multiplied submillimeter spectrometer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a tunable far-infrared spectrometer at University of Toyama, and a high-resolution Bruker IFS 125 Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Highly excited ammonia was created with a radiofrequency discharge and a dc discharge, which allowed assignments of transitions with J up to 35. One hundred and seventy seven ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion transitions were observed with microwave accuracy in the 0.3-4.7 THz region. Of these, 125 were observed for the first time, including 26 Delta K = 3 transitions. Over 2000 far-infrared transitions were assigned to the ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion bands as well as the nu(2) fundamental band. Of these, 1912 were assigned using the FTS data for the first time, including 222 Delta K = 3 transitions. The accuracy of these measurements has been estimated to be 0.0003-0.0006 cm(-1). A reduced root mean square error of 0.9 was obtained for a global fit of the ground and nu(2) = 1 states, which includes the lines assigned in this work and all previously available microwave, terahertz, far-infrared, and mid-infrared data. The new measurements and predictions reported here will support the analyses of astronomical observations by high-resolution spectroscopy telescopes such as Herschel, SOFIA, and ALMA. The comprehensive experimental rovibrational energy levels reported here will permit further refinement of the potential energy surface to improve ammonia ab initio calculations and facilitate assignment of new high-resolution spectra of hot ammonia.

We apply these new models to the identification of NH 3 absorption in the H -band peak of very late T dwarfs and the new Y dwarfs and discuss the observed trend in the NH 3 - H spectral index.

   employed together with the variational nuclear motion code GENIUSH (J.
   Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 134112; 2011, 134, 074105) to determine directly
   measurable, effective structural parameters of the (NH3)-N-14 and

   determined at 300 K are 1.0307(1.0254) and 1.0256(1.0217) angstrom,

   effective theta(g) HNH and DND bond angles at 300 K are 106.91 degrees

   vibration, l(g), for the NH(ND) distances at 300 K are 0.073(0.062)

   and para forms) of (NH3)-N-14 is 3 x 10(-5) angstrom at 0 K, the

abstract = { Intrapulse quantum cascade (QC) laser spectrometers are able to produce both saturation and molecular alignment of a gas sample owing to the rapid sweep of the radiation through the absorption features. In the QC lasers used to study the 14N and 15N isotopologues of the Î½4 band of ammonia centered near 1625 cmâ€“1, the variation of the chirp rate during the scan is very large, from ca. 85 to ca. 15 MHz nsâ€“1. In the rapid chirp zone the collisional interaction time of the laser radiation with the gas molecules is short, and large rapid passage effects are seen, whereas at the slow chirp end the line shape resembles that of a Doppler broadened line. The total scan range of the QC laser of ca. 10 cmâ€“1 is sufficient to allow the spectra of both isotopologues to be recorded and the rapid and slow interactions with the laser radiation to be seen. The rapid passage effects are enhanced by the use of an off axis Herriott cell with an effective path length of 62 m, which allows a buildup of polarization to occur. The effective resolution of the chirped QC laser is ca. 0.012 cmâ€“1 full width at half-maximum in the 1625 cmâ€“1 region. The results of these experiments are compared with those of other studies of the Î½4 band of ammonia carried out using Fourier transform and Laser Stark spectroscopy. They also demonstrate the versatility of the down chirped QC laser for investigating collisional effects in low pressure gases using long absorbing path lengths. }

CEAS data helped in this respect for the lowest J lines, some of which are
saturated in the CRDS spectrum. Further information on a/s doublets arose
from the observed spectral structures. Thirty-two transitions of 14NH3
were assigned in this way and a limited but significant number (19)

Abstract = {A new vibrational Hamiltonian operator for ammonia is presented. The
   potential energy part is expressed in terms of symmetrized bond-angle
   valence coordinates and an inversion coordinate, which is a function of
   the bond angles. In the exact kinetic energy operator, the stretching
   part is instead given in terms of unsymmetrized bond displacement
   coordinates. Six-dimensional ammonia potential energy surfaces are
   calculated using high-level ab initio tools, the CCSD(T) method with
   aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The potential energy functions
   are constructed in two, two-dimensional steps. The surfaces are
   expressed as a Taylor-type series with respect to the doubly degenerate
   asymmetric stretching and bending coordinates. This representation is
   given along a two-dimensional surface of the totally symmetric
   stretching and inversion coordinates of ammonia. Vibrational energies
   are calculated variationally in a finite basis representation. Employing
   successive basis set contractions, it is possible to optimize some
   potential energy parameters simultaneously for seven symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers very effectively. The symmetric part of the
   surface is fitted to experimentally observed vibrational band centers up
   to 6000 cm(-1). This reduces the mean absolute error from 7.84 cm(-1)
   with a pure ab initio potential to 0.44 cm(-1) compared to the
   experimental values for (14)NH(3). In addition, vibrational energy
   levels of (14)NH(3) have been calculated up to about 15 000 cm(-1) using
   the pure ab initio surface obtained with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The
   nuclear motion calculation converges all levels up to about 10 000

Abstract = {A bidimensional vibrational Hamiltonian expressed in terms of internal

   inversion of asymmetric pyramidal ammonia-like molecules. This work is
   an extension of the approach we have recently presented on NH3 and on
   some of its C-3v isotopomers {[}J. Chem. Phys. 115 (2001) 1243]. A new
   set of internal coordinates, which reflects the symmetry of the problem,
   has been defined and used to obtain a new bidimensional kinetic energy
   operator. Inversion levels for NH2D and NHD2 have been calculated
   variationally using an ab initio CCSD(T) bidimensional potential energy
   surface (PES). A good agreement with experimental values has been
   obtained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A new inversion coordinate is defined for ammonia as a function of the
   valence angles. Its square is similar to the often used totally
   symmetric bending displacement coordinate for the pyramidal XY3-type
   molecules. We have used this in a two-dimensional calculation including
   the totally symmetric stretching and the inversion mode. A conventional
   symmetrized internal coordinate is employed for the symmetric stretch. A
   two-dimensional potential energy surface is calculated using the ab
   initio CCSD(T) method together with the aug-cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, and
   aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. The corresponding eigenvalues are calculated
   variationally using a Morse oscillator basis set for the stretch and a
   harmonic oscillator basis set for the inversion. A good agreement is
   obtained between the calculated and 22 experimental inversion levels, 9
   of (NH3)-N-14 and the others involving 4 other isotopomers ((ND3)-N-14,
   (NH3)-N-15, (ND3)-N-15, and (NT3)-N-14). With the aug-cc-pVTZ basis, a
   mean absolute error of 5.0 cm(-1) is obtained whereas with the
   aug-cc-pVQZ basis set the error becomes 7.9 cm(-1). (C) 2001 American

Abstract = {The ammonia molecule, containing large amplitude inversion motion is a
   revealing system in examining high-order correlation effects on
   potential energy surfaces. Correlation contributions to the equilibrium
   and saddle point geometries, inversion barrier height and vibrational
   energy levels, including inversion splittings, have been investigated. A
   six-dimensional Taylor-type series expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer
   potential energy surface, which is scaled to different levels of theory,
   is used to determine vibrational energy levels and inversion splittings
   variationally. The electronic energies are calculated by coupled-cluster
   methods, combining explicitly correlated R12 theory (which includes the
   interelectronic coordinate in the electronic wave function) with a
   conventional approach including excitations up to the pentuple level.
   Finally, the electronic correlation contribution is scaled to the full
   configuration interaction limit. Corrections due to relativistic and
   non-Born-Oppenheimer effects are also included. Special emphasis is put
   on the convergence of the high-order contributions with respect to the
   size of the atomic basis set. To achieve an accuracy of 1 cm(-1), it is
   essential to be at the basis set limit, include all the subtle effects

Abstract = {New potential energy surfaces are calculated for the hydronium ion using
   high-order coupled cluster ab initio methods. Large basis sets are used
   especially for the inversion part of the full surface. Electronic
   energies obtained with different correlation consistent basis sets are
   extrapolated to the infinite basis set limit. Core-valence and first
   order relativistic effects are also included. The influence of these two
   contributions and basis set sizes on both the inversion barrier height
   and equilibrium geometry are investigated thoroughly. The same methods
   are also adopted for ammonia in order to further improve a recently
   published surface {[}J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6358 (2003)]. The vibrational
   eigenvalues are calculated variationally both for the symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers using exact six-dimensional kinetic energy
   operators and successive basis set contractions. With the new surfaces,
   the mean absolute deviations obtained for all experimentally observed
   inversion splittings for different isotopomers of H(3)O(+) (8 states)
   and (14)NH(3) (17 states) are 0.78 and 0.25 cm(-1), respectively.
   Inversion levels are calculated with almost similar accuracy. These
   results indicate that the calculated inversion barrier heights for
   H(3)O(+) and NH(3), 650 and 1792 cm(-1), respectively, are close to the
   real values. The value for ammonia is also close to the height
   determined from published experimental data in our previous work. The
   lowest energies for the high-frequency modes are computed with the mean
   absolute deviation being less than 2 cm(-1) for isotopomers of H(3)O(+)
   and less than 4.5 cm(-1) for (14)NH(3) with respect to experimental

Journal = CP,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {305},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {105-113},
Month = {OCT 25},
Abstract = {In the present work, we study the vibrational spectrum of ammonia in
   full dimensionality (6D), with special emphasis on the tunneling
   splitting. The inversion motion, i.e., the active mode v(2), is indeed
   relatively well decoupled from the other five inactive modes. Therefore,
   an adiabatic separation in an active wave function and an inactive one,
   approximated with a 5D-harmonic basis function, is certainly well
   adapted to describing this motion. This separation leads to several
   1D-effective Hamiltonians for each 5D-harmonic basis function or
   adiabatic channel. Two models have been tested: the harmonic adiabatic
   approximation (HADA), when only one channel is used and the coupled HADA
   (cHADA), when several channels are coupled.
   In order to get reliable values for tunneling splitting, our
   calculations have shown that: (i) the calculation of the electronic
   potential has to be performed with a large atomic basis set (up to
   quintuple zeta) with a method including core-valence correlation; (ii)
   the cHADA is required since the HADA overestimates the energy levels.
   Furthermore, our values for the tunneling splitting are in good
   agreement with the experimental data of ammonia and several isotopomers.

   corresponding symmetric (s) and antisymmetric (a) rovibrational energy
   level pairs. The experimental transition data useful from the point of
   view of the present analysis cover the range 0.7-7000 cm(-1),
   sufficiently detailed rovibrational energy sets worth analyzing are
   available for 20 vibrational bands. The highest J value, where J stands
   for the rotational quantum number, within the experimental dataset
   employed is 30. Coupling of the ``umbrella'' motion of (NH3)-N-14 with
   other vibrational degrees of freedom has only a minor effect on the a-s
   tunneling splitting characterizing the ground vibrational state,
   0.79436(70) cm(-1). In the majority of the cases rotation around the C-3
   axis increases, while rotation around the two perpendicular axes
   decreases the tunneling splittings. For example, for the pair of
   vibrational ground states, 0(+) and 0(-), the tunneling splitting
   basically disappears at around J = 25 for the (J, K) = (J,1) states,
   where K = vertical bar k vertical bar is the usual quantum number
   characterizing the projection of the rotational angular momentum on the
   principal axis. The tunneling splittings, defined as energy differences
   E(a) - E(s) of corresponding energy level pairs, as a function of J and
   K show a very regular behavior for the ground state (GS) and the n nu(2)
   bands. For the other bands investigated exceptions from a regular
   behavior do occur, especially for bands characterized by degenerate
   vibrations, and occasionally the data available are not sufficient to
   arrive at definitive conclusions. The most irregular behavior is
   observed for rotational states characterized by the k - l = 3n rule (l
   is the vibrational angular momentum quantum number), with n = 0, 1,

   pressure (1013 +/- 20 mbar) are measured. NH3 concentrations of 1000
   ppm, 0.5\% and 1\% in volume fraction were used in the measurements.
   Spectra are recorded in high temperature gas flow cells using a Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer at a nominal resolution of 0.09
   cm(-1). Measurements at 22.7 degrees C are compared to high-resolution
   cross sections available from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
   (PNNL). The higher temperature spectra are analysed by comparison to a
   variational line list, BYTe, and experimental energy levels determined
   using the MARVEL procedure. Approximately 2000 lines have been assigned,
   of which 851 are newly assigned to mainly hot bands involving
   vibrational states as high as v(2)=5. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier
