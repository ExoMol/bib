Abstract = {A search has been carried out for the presence of rotational lines of
   two bands of the (0, 0) and (1, 1) A (1)I -aEuro parts per thousand X
   (1)I (+) pound system of the AlH molecule in the high resolution Fourier
   Transform Spectra of sunspots observed at the National Solar Observatory
   at Kitt Peak. Though the presence of the AlH molecule in sunspots was
   confirmed by Wallace, Hinkle, and Livingston (An Atlas of Sunspot Umbral
   Spectra in the Visible from 15 000 to 25 000 cm(-1) (3920 to 6664 ),
   Tech. Rep. 00-001, National Solar Observatory, Tucson, AZ, 2000), there
   is no report on the rotational temperature in the literature by
   identifying AlH molecular lines. The results obtained in this new search
   using a suitable identification technique are compared with the results
   reported by Wallace, Hinkle, and Livingston (2000). In view of the fact
   that the rotational temperatures of the molecules could be used to test
   photospheric and sunspot models, the effective rotational temperature
   for the (0, 0) band of the A -aEuro parts per thousand X system of AlH
   molecule is estimated by measuring the equivalent widths of well
   resolved spectral lines and its value justifies the existence of the AlH
   molecule in sunspots.},

Abstract = {The J = 2 <- 1 and 3 <- 2 rotational transitions of AlD (X (1)Sigma(+))
   near 393 and 590 GHz have been measured using submillimeter direct
   absorption spectroscopy. AlD was created in an AC discharge of
   Al(CH(3))(3) and D(2) in the presence of argon. This work is the first
   direct measurement of the J = 3 <- 2 transition of AlD. Each transition
   was found to be split into multiple hyperfine components due to the
   (27)Al nuclear spin of I = 5/2, some of which are blended together. The
   data for AlD were fit with an effective Hamiltonian and rotational,
   electric quadrupole, and nuclear spin-rotation constants were determined
   for the molecule. The accuracy of these constants has been improved by a
   factor of 2-3, compared to previous studies. From these data,
   predictions for the J = 1 -> 0 and 4 -> 3 transitions of AlD have also
   been made. Photospheric AlH has been observed via its A (1)Pi-X
   (1)Sigma(+) electronic transition, suggesting that this species may be
   present in circumstellar gas surrounding late-type stars, where four
   aluminum-bearing molecules have already been detected. High deuterium
   enrichment has been observed in hydride species in molecular clouds,
   making AlD a feasible candidate for searches in these objects as well.},

   sigma(2)4 sigma(2)1 pi(4)5 sigma(2)2 pi with a vertical electronic
   affinity value of 0.22 eV which is in good agreement with the estimated

Journal = JCP,

Volume = {130},

Month = {MAR 21},
Abstract = {Vibrational zero-point energies (ZPEs) determined from ab initio
   calculations are often scaled by empirical factors. An empirical scaling
   factor partially compensates for the effects arising from vibrational
   anharmonicity and incomplete treatment of electron correlation. These
   effects are not random but are systematic. We report scaling factors for
   32 combinations of theory and basis set, intended for predicting ZPEs
   from computed harmonic frequencies. An empirical scaling factor carries
   uncertainty. We quantify and report, for the first time, the
   uncertainties associated with scaling factors for ZPE. The uncertainties
   are larger than generally acknowledged; the scaling factors have only
   two significant digits. For example, the scaling factor for
   B3LYP/6-31G(d) is 0.9757 +/- 0.0224 (standard uncertainty). The
   uncertainties in the scaling factors lead to corresponding uncertainties
   in predicted ZPEs. The proposed method for quantifying the uncertainties
   associated with scaling factors is based upon the Guide to the
   Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, published by the International
   Organization for Standardization. We also present a new reference set of
   60 diatomic and 15 polyatomic ``experimental{''} ZPEs that includes
   estimated uncertainties.},

Abstract = {The J = 0 --> 1 transition of AlH at 377 GHz and the J = 1 --> 2 line of

   methods. The two species were created by the reaction of aluminum vapor
   and H 2 or D 2 gas in a DC discharge. The Al-27 quadrupole hyperfine
   splittings, which are critical for the astronomical identification of
   these molecules, were measured for both AlH and AlD. In the case of AlH,
   the observed hyperfine pattern was not consistent with previous
   measurements. Values of the hyperfine parameters have thus been revised
   to be eQq = -48.59 MHz and C-1 = 0.306 MHz, which agree very closely
   with recent ab initio predictions. For AlD, eQq was established to be
   -48.48 MHz with C1 = 0.156 MHz - the first determination of the
   hyperfine parameters for the molecule. These measurements should enable
   viable astronomical searches to be conducted for AlH and AlD, presumably

   reported. AlH was prepared by 193 nm photolysis of trimethylaluminum
   diluted in slowly flowing Ar at similar to 0.5 Torr total pressure.
   Specific rotational, Lambda-doublet levels of AlH(A (1)Pi,v=0) were
   prepared by pulsed dye laser excitation on rotational lines in the AlH A
   (1)Pi-X (1)Sigma(+) (0,0) band, and final levels were detected by
   spectrally resolving the fluorescence emission. Bimolecular
   state-to-state and total removal rate constants were determined. The
   state-to-state rate constants display dramatic Lambda-doublet
   propensities. In particular, for high initial rotational levels the
   Delta J=-1 f-->e Lambda-doublet symmetry changing transitions had
   significantly larger rate constants than for Delta J=-1 f-->f
   Lambda-doublet symmetry conserving transitions. These Lambda-doublet
   changing transitions are facilitated by curve crossing between the
   effective potential energy curves correlating with different rotational
   asymptotes. The total removal rate constants decrease with increasing
   initial J, reflecting the increasing rotational spacings. (C) 2000

Abstract = {A flexible new analytical representation for the internuclear potential
   energy of a diatomic molecule is proposed and tested. The new model may
   be thought of as a generalization of the prototypical Lennard-Jones
   (2n,n) function, with the form V(R)=D-e{[}1-(R-e/R)(n)e(-beta(z)z)](2),
   where z=(R- R-e)/(R+R-e) is a dimensionless radial distance variable
   which approaches 1 as R -->infinity. This form explicitly incorporates
   the theoretically predicted attractive inverse-power asymptotic behavior
   V(R)=D-C-n/R-n associated with most potential energy curves. This
   ``modified Lennard-Jones{''} (MLJ) function is tested against other
   flexible forms for the potential energy by performing nonlinear
   least-squares fits both to known numerical potential curves and to

Abstract = {The weakly bound Al ... H-2 complex was prepared in a pulsed supersonic

   Transitions to bound bend-stretch levels in the electronic state
   correlating with the Al(5s)+H-2 asymptote have been observed. Resonance
   fluorescence from the excited levels could be detected only very weakly.
   These excited levels decay mainly nonradiatively, and the excitation
   spectrum was obtained by monitoring emission from the lower Al atomic
   levels, 4s and 3d, and AlH A-->X chemiluminescence due to AlH(A (1)Pi)
   formed in the reactive decay of the excited Al(5s)... H-2 complex. The
   action spectra show a progression of bands which were assigned as a
   progression in the excited state Al-H-2 stretch vibrational mode. The
   AlH chemiluminescence was recorded with 0.8 nm spectral resolution.
   Emission in the A-X (0,0) and (1,1) bands, from the upsilon'=0 and 1
   vibrational levels of the A (1)Pi state, was observed. The relative
   emission intensity of the Q branches was found to be depressed from that
   expected if the e and f levels of the excited state were equally

   the A (1)Pi state. A strong propensity to form a levels, with
   considerable rotational excitation, was found. The Lambda-doublet

   7.0675 cm-1, D(e) = 6.1 x 10(-5) cm-1, alpha(e) = 0.637 cm-1, beta(e) =
   6.38 x 10(-4), and gamma(e) = 1.5725, with upsilon = 0 spin-orbit and
   spin-rotation coupling parameters lambda-0 = 0.29 cm-1, and gamma-0 =
   0.03 cm-1, inducing structure in a transition that appears to be
   predominantly parallel. For upsilon = 1, spin-orbit coupling is much
   stronger, and rotational branch intensities suggest interference,
   indicating that both parallel and perpendicular components of the
   transition moment contribute to the total oscillator strength. Results
   for the C-X (0-0) transitions give B0 = 6.3869 cm-1 and D0 = 5.329 x
   10(-4) with T0 = 44 594.05 cm-1 for the AlH C state, and B0 = 3.3457

Abstract = {The infrared spectra of the monodeuteride of aluminium has been measured
   in the gas phase in its ground electronic state ((1)SIGMA) using a diode
   laser spectrometer.  These experimental results were combined with those
   available for AlH from infrared Fourier transform spectra of the upsilon
   = 2 --> 0 sequence bands in order to calculate a set of mass-independent
   parameters and mass scaling coefficients.  A set of Dunham parameters
   was also determined from the AlD data.  The values of the mass scaling
   coefficients of the hydrides of four group IIIa metals are discussed.},

Abstract = {The electronic structure and electronic states of AlPh (P = porphin
   dianion) have been investigated by means of SCF, two-configurations SCF
   (TC-SCF) and contracted Cl calculations.  The binding energy
   corresponding to the dissociation of the Al-H bond is 82 and 92 kcal/mol
   at the TC-SCF and Cl levels, appreciably larger than the values of 55
   and 59 kcal/mol obtained at the same levels of theory for the diatomic
   hydride AlH (a consequence of the different nature of the bonding with a
   sigma-bond involving a 3s orbital of Al in AlPH and a 3p-sigma orbital
   in AlH).  The two 3E-pi --> pi{*} states were calculated at 20400 and
   21200 cm-1 and the corresponding 1E states at 24600 and 44100 cm-1.  The
   1E and 3E sigma --> pi{*} states (sigma being the m.o. which is bonding
   between Al and H) were located at 33200 and 35400 cm-1.  The potential
   energy curves corresponding to the dissociation of the Al-H bond in AlPH
   were calculated at the MR-ClSD level with six electrons correlated.  A
   qualitative mechanism has been proposed for the photolysis of the Al-X
   bond in AlPX (X = H or CH3) on the basis of these potential energy
   curves.  A rationale has also been given for the accelerating effect of
   visible light in the reactions of aluminium alkyl- and arylporphyrins
   with nucleophiles.},

	ion was investigated in the range of 27000-9000 cm(-1) by using a
	conventional spectroscopic technique. The AlH+ molecules were formed
	and excited in an aluminium hollow-cathode lamp with two anodes,
	filled with a mixture of Ne carried gas and a trace of NH3. The emission
	from the discharge was observed with a plane grating spectrograph
	and recorded by a photomultiplier tube. The full rotational structure
	of the 0-0 and 1-1 bands has been observed for the first time (12
	branches up J{''} = 36.5) and many new constants of the X-2 Sigma(+)
	state have been derived from the analysis. For the A(2)Pi, nu = 0
	and 1 state a considerable irregularities of the Lambda-doubling
	have been observed. The most reasonable explanation for this anomaly
	is an interaction with unstableness rotational levels of X-2 Sigma(+)
	state and perturbing of the A(2)Pi state by the nearly lyingB(2)Sigma(+)
	state. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The laser fluorescence excitation spectrum of the b (3)Sigma(-)-a
	(3)Pi (0,0) band of AlH and AlD is reported. The AlH/AlD(a (3)Pi)
	state was prepared in a free-jet supersonic expansion by the reaction
	of photolyzed trimethylaluminum with hydrogen or deuterium. Spectroscopic
	constants for the upper and lower vibronic levels were derived from
	fits to the measured transition wave numbers of the rotational lines.
	Lifetimes of J' = 1 rotational/fine-structure levels of electronically
	excited AlH/AlD(b 3Sigma-, upsilon' = 0) were determined from fluorescence
	decay waveforms with laser excitation on isolated rotational lines.
	The measured lifetimes were compared with values obtained in a theoretical
	treatment of the excited-state decay dynamics, wherein both radiative
	decay to the a (3)Pi state and nonradiative decay through the repulsive
	1 (3)Sigma(+) state were considered. The experimental and theoretical
	lifetimes are in good agreement. The theoretical treatment shows
	that the nonradiative excited-state decay dominates over radiative
	decay. The observed fine-structure dependence of the lifetimes results
	is due to the nature of the spin-orbit coupling of the b (3)Sigma(-)
	state with the 1 (3)Sigma(+) continuum. (C) 2003 American Institute

  abstract = {The feasibility of laser cooling AlH and AlF is investigated using
	ab initio quantum chemistry. All the electronic states corresponding
	to the ground and lowest two excited states of the Al atom are calculated
	using multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) and the large
	AV6Z basis set for AlH. The smaller AVQZ basis set is used to calculate
	the valence electronic states of AlF. Theoretical Franck-Condon factors
	are determined for the A(1)Pi -> X(1)Sigma(+) transitions in both
	radicals and found to agree with the highly diagonal factors found
	experimentally, suggesting computational chemistry is an effective
	method for screening suitable laser cooling candidates. AlH does
	not appear to have a transition quite as diagonal as that in SrF
	(which has been laser cooled) but the A(1)Pi -> X(1)Sigma(+) transition
	transition of AlF is a strong candidate for cooling with just a single
	laser, though the cooling frequency is deep in the UV. Furthermore,
	the a (3)Pi -> X(1)Sigma(+) transitions are also strongly diagonal
	and in AlF is a practical method for obtaining very low final temperatures
