Title = {Spectroscopy of AlO: Combined analysis of the A(2)Pi(i) -> X(2)Sigma(+)

Abstract = {A combined analysis of the A(2)Pi(i) -> X(2)Sigma(+) and B(2)Sigma(+) ->
   X(2)Sigma(+) band systems of AlO, involving 21,500 line assignments, has
   been performed. The analysis indicates that the previously reported
   gamma values of the B(2)Sigma(+) state are questionable. The present
   analysis shows that gamma(B(2)Sigma(+))approximate to 0.014 cm(-1),
   essentially independent of the vibrational level. The positive sign is
   consistent with second order interaction with the higher-lying C(2)Pi(r)
   and lower-lying A(2)Pi(i) states. It also appears that many of the
   previously reported gamma and gamma(D) values of X(2)Sigma(+) (v > 0)
   are doubtful. In fact, gamma(X(2)Sigma(+)) is observed to become
   increasingly negative for v `' > 1, due to second order interaction with
   the low-lying A(2)Pi(i) state. The present results are based on models
   where the hyperfine structure of the (2)Sigma(+) states has been taken
   into account explicitly. Intensity patterns of the branches of the
   B(2)Sigma(+) -> X(2)Sigma(+) system have been shown to be influenced by
   the case b beta(s) coupling in the ground state v = 0,1 levels. This
   gives rise to intensity differences of around 10 percent in the
   R(1)/R(2) and P(1)/P(2) doublet components. The synthesized intensity
   patterns are fully in accord with the F(1)/F(2) assignments of the
   present work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Molecular vibrations and electronic structure of the X(2)Sigma(+),
   B(2)Sigma(+), D(2)Sigma(+), and F(2)Sigma(+) states of AlO are studied
   by carrying out ab initio configuration interaction calculations and
   molecular vibration calculations using accurate potential energy
   functions. An avoided crossing between the D(2)Sigma(+) and F(2)Sigma(+)
   potential energy curves occurs in the neighborhood of 4.0 a(0) and
   results in irregular vibrational levels of the D and F(2)Sigma(+)
   states. The vibrational constants for the F(2)Sigma(+) state are
   predicted from the vibrational levels not involved in the irregularity.
   Configuration mixing is important in describing the B, D, and
   F(2)Sigma(+) states. The F(2)Sigma(+) state at and around its well
   minimum and the D and F(2)Sigma(+) states in the avoided crossing region
   are characterized in terms of their main configurations and dipole
   moment functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Number = {2-3},
Pages = {258-269},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {Theoretical evaluations of g-tensors have seen noticeable progress in
   recent years. Promising results in agreement with experiment have been
   reported especially for small systems. However, the diatomic molecule
   AlO has proved to be a difficult test case. In contradiction to common
   understanding, the g-tensor of this system is strongly dependent on the
   internuclear distance. The vicinity of the first excited state A(2)Pi to
   the ground state X-2 Sigma(+) and their potential energy curve crossing
   close to the equilibrium distance contraindicate strongly the
   application of a conventional perturbation approach. Using a diabatic
   representation of the lowest electronic states, a vibrationally averaged
   value for Delta g(perpendicular to)(v = 0) = -608 ppm is obtained. The
   non-negligible contribution of high-lying excited states to the g-tensor
   indicate that a sum-over-states calculation is difficult to converge.
   Translating the ground state potential energy curve as to reproduce the
   relative position inferred from experiment and including higher (2)Pi
   states perturbationally yields our best estimate of Delta
   g(perpendicular to)(v = 0) = -1048 ppm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The spectrum of B-2 Sigma(+) system of AlO has been reduced on BOMEM DA8
   Fourier transform spectrometer at an apodized resolution of 0.05 cm(-1).
   Nineteen bands of the Delta v = 1, 0, -1, and -2 sequences of this band

   seven bands, viz. 3-2, 4-3, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 have been
   analyzed for the first time. The rotational lines of these 19 bands
   along with 20 earlier analyzed bands, a total of 7200 lines, have been
   fitted in a simultaneous least squares fit. The study has resulted in
   determining more precise vibrational and rotational constants of the two
   states. Because of the high resolution employed it became necessary to
   invoke H-0 and H-1 coefficients, and a fifth order term to explain the
   anomalous spin-doubling observed in the v `' = 5, 6 and 7 levels of the

Abstract = {The electron-spin g shifts (magnetic moments mu (S)) of X(2)Sigma (+)(1
   pi (4)3 sigma) radicals MX(+/-) with nine valence electrons are
   calculated at their equilibrium geometries, using second-order
   perturbation theory, a Hamiltonian based on Breit-Pauli theory, and
   correlated (MRCI) wave functions. Eighteen diatomics have been studied:
   BeF, BeO-, BeCl,MgF, MgO-, and MgCl (class I); BF+, BCl+, AlF+, and
   AlCl+ (class II); and BO, BN-, BS, BP-, AlO, AlN-, AlS, and AlP- (class
   III). Most radicals have small Deltag(parallel to) values (approximate
   to -100 ppm) and large negative agi values (-800 to -8500 ppm), except
   for AlN- and AlP-, which have positive agi values (1400 and 10 000 ppm)
   due to the quasi-degeneracy X(2)Sigma (+)/1(2)Pi (i). The
   sum-over-states expansions for Deltag(perpendicular to) are dominated in
   classes I and II by the coupling with 1(2)Pi (r), and in class III with
   both 1(2)Pi (i) and 2(2)Pi (r). The (2)Pi (r)(3 sigma -->2 pi) state
   always contributes negatively, whereas (2)Pi (i)(1 pi -->3 sigma)
   contributes positively for most radicals but negatively for the boron
   series BO, BN-, BS, and BP-. Experimental g shifts, which are available
   for eight of the radicals studied here, are generally well reproduced by
   the Deltag values calculated at R,. However, for radicals having a very
   low-lying 1(2)Pi (i) state, such as AlN- and AlP-, our study suggests
   that future calculations should include vibrational averaging to
   describe the (unknown) experimental data correctly. Theoretical and
   experimental g(perpendicular to) shifts are compared with those
   estimated from spin-rotation coupling constants gamma, via Curl's
   equation.},

Abstract = {The adiabatic electron affinities of five second row atoms (Al, Si, P,
   S, Cl) and their monoxides and dioxides were determined using six
   different density functional or hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional
   methods. The 15 species selected form a convenient closed set for which
   reliable experimental electron affinities exist for 13 of the species.
   Zero-point vibrational energy corrected electron affinities are also
   reported. Equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies were
   determined with each density functional method. The method based on the
   Becke exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation (BLYP)
   functional reproduced the experimental electron affinities most
   accurately, having an average absolute error of 0.15 eV. Using this
   functional, the electron affinities were predicted for SiO and SiO2,
   molecules for which electron affinities are not known experimentally, as
   0.11 eV and 2.03 eV, respectively. It is concluded that the accuracy
   observed for density functional theory methods applied to first row
   atoms and molecules extends to molecules containing second row atoms and
   that density functional theory continues to provide a computationally
   affordable means of producing electron affinities reliable to within a
   few tenths of an eV of definitive experimental values. (C) 1999 American

Abstract = {Results of CASSCF state-averaged calculations on the lowest electronic
   states of LaO and LaO+ are reported in this work. For comparison, some
   low-lying electronic states of AlO and AlO+ are also reported. The
   ground state of LaO was found to be the X(2) Sigma(+) (R(e) = 1.987
   Angstrom, omega(e) = 794 cm(-1)) with a low-lying A(2) Delta excited
   state. Five more excited states below 26000 cm(-1) were found. The first
   ionization potential (IP) is found at 5.16 eV, resulting in an X(1)
   Sigma(+) ground state for the LaO+ diatom, in opposition to AlO+ for
   which and X(3) Pi ground state has been found. Analysis of the wave
   functions, dipole moments, and Mulliken populations reveal that the
   bonding is quite ionic in both systems. (C) 1994 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {The infrared A2PI(i)-X2SIGMA+ band system of AlO has been recorded with
   Fourier transform techniques using an electrodeless 2450-MHz discharge
   as a source.  Transitions involving upsilon = 0-3 of X2SIGMA+ and
   upsilon = 0-10 of A2PI(i) have been observed.  Local perturbations
   affect the different levels of the A2PI(i) state, and all these
   perturbations are shown to be caused by vibrational levels of the
   X2SIGMA+ state.  Extra lines originating from the nominal upsilon = 7, 8
   levels of X2SIGMA+ are observed in the proximity of the A2PI(i) (upsilon
   = 2) <-> X2SIGMA+ (upsilon = 7) and A2PI(i) (upsilon = 3) <-> X2SIGMA+
   (upsilon = 8) crossings.  In total, data from 23 vibrational bands are
   included in the analysis.  The spin splittings of the X2SIGMA+ state are
   strongly dependent of upsilon''.  The X2SIGMA+ state also shows clearly
   noticeable nuclear hyperfine effects, manifested by numerous
   hyperfine-induced DELTAJ = +/-2 branches.  A global deperturbation has
   been performed for upsilon = 0-8 of A2PI(i) and for the corresponding
   intersecting levels upsilon = 5-11 of X2SIGMA+.  The X2SIGMA+ state has
   been fitted both with and without hyperfine parameters.  The inclusion
   of the hyperfine interaction was found to be necessary in order to
   describe the X2SIGMA+ ground state adequately.  The anomalous intensity
   distributions among branches terminating at different vibrational levels
   of the X2SIGMA+ state are discussed.  The strong B2SIGMA+-X2SIGMA+
   system has been recorded with FTS techniques, and the contradictory
   results of Mahieu et al. and Lagerqvist et al. regarding the gamma value
   of the B2SIGMA+ state are discussed in the light of the new
   parameterization of the X2SIGMA+ state, and the spin component
   assignments presented in the work of Lagerqvist et al. have been
   reestablished.  (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {SCF calculations using an extended double-zeta basis set have been
   performed in order to obtain information about the energy spectrum of
   AlO. The variational calculations concerned six states of AlO and three
   states of AlO+. Correlation energy differences were estimated
   semiempirically to correct the single-configuration approximation. The
   predominant configurations of the observed states of AlO have been
   identified by using a comparison between the calculated and observed
   spectroscopic elements: term values, rotational, vibrational and
   spin-orbit constants, compatibility of observed systems. This has led us
   to deduce the probable locations of as yet unobserved states and to
   predict the wavelength of a number of transitions in which they are
   involved. The ground state of AlO+ has been found to be stable but its
   symmetry ((3)Pi or (1)Sigma(+)) could not be ascertained. Particular
   emphasis has been laid on a study of the (2 pi(3) 6 sigma(2) 7o3 pi)
   configuration or the highest-lying observed states of AlO. D-2 Sigma(+)
   and E-2 Delta(j). It is suggested that the quartet levels of this
   configuration are responsible for the perturbations experimentally found
   in C-2 Pi(I). The predissociation observed for E-2 Delta(i) is finally
   discussed in terms of avoided crossings of potential curves.},

Abstract = {A new circumstellar molecule, the radical AlO (X (2)Sigma(+)), has been
   detected toward the envelope of the oxygen-rich supergiant star VY Canis
   Majoris (VY CMa) using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). The N = 7 ->
   6 and 6 -> 5 rotational transitions of AlO at 268 and 230 GHz were
   observed at 1 mm using the ARO Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) and the N =
   4 -> 3 line was detected at 2 mm using the ARO 12 m telescope. Based on
   the shape of the line profiles, AlO most likely arises from the
   dust-forming region in the spherical outflow of VY CMa, as opposed to
   the blue or redshifted winds, with a source size of theta(s) similar to
   0.'' 5. Given this source size, the column density of AlO was found to
   be N(tot) similar to 2 x 10(15) cm(-2) for T(rot) similar to 230 K, with
   a fractional abundance, relative to H(2), of similar to 10(-8).
   Gas-phase thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry is the likely formation
   mechanism for AlO in VY CMa, but either shocks disrupt the condensation
   process into Al(2)O(3), or chemical ``freezeout{''} occurs. The species
   therefore survives further into the circumstellar envelope to a radius
   of r similar to 20 R({*}). The detection of AlO in VY CMa is additional
   evidence of an active gas-phase refractory chemistry in oxygen-rich
   envelopes, and suggests such objects may be fruitful sources for other
   new oxide identifications.},

   Application of this method to those molecules improves remarkably the
   spectroscopic constants. This method can be easily extended to
   polyatomic cases involving a polar bonding between an electropositive
   moiety (electron donor) and an electronegative functional group
   (electron acceptor).},

Abstract = {Using density functional theory methods and large basis sets, we
   calculated hyperfine coupling constants (HFCCs) for the B-11, O-17,
   Al-27, and Ga-69 nuclei of the radicals BO, AlO, and GaO (XO), embedded
   in 2-14 rare gas (Rg) Ne and Ar atoms. Kr atoms were included for AlO.
   The distance of the Rg atoms from XO was varied from 4 to 12 bohr.
   Matrix effects cause A(iso)(X) to increase, accompanied by decreases in
   A(dip)(X) and A(dip)(O), while A(iso)(O) remains close to zero. Changes
   are largest for AlO, slightly smaller for GaO, and very small for BO, in
   line with the molecular polarizabilities. Observed changes of A(iso)(X)
   and A(dip)(X) for BO in Ne matrixes and for AlO in Ne, Ar, and Kr
   matrixes are reproduced in complexes with 12 Rg atoms at distances of
   5-6 bohr or 14 Rg atoms at distances of 6-7 bohr. For GaO, experimental
   data are available only in Ne matrixes. Theoretical results obtained for
   HFCCs of O-17 could not be verified due to insufficient experimental
   information. Estimates of HFCCs in matrixes not yet experimentally
   studied and for GaO in the gas phase have been made. Due to the
   interaction with rare gas atoms, p-spin density on the X and O atoms of
   XO is converted into s-spin density on X, thereby causing an increase
   (in magnitude) of A(iso)(X), accompanied by decreases in A(dip) of X and
   O. The higher polarizability of XO along the bond axis is reflected in
   complexes that have axial Rg atoms showing larger changes in HFCCs than
   comparable complexes without axial Rg atoms.},

Abstract = {A complex emission spectrum in the 440-550 nm region has been recorded
   by bombarding targets of Al2O3 (and Al under low O-2 partial pressure)
   polycrystalline surface with fast (5 keV) Kr+ ion beams under high
   vacuum (10(-8) Torr). This spectrum has been compared with the
   chemiluminescence spectrum of AlO formed by laser ablation of an Al
   target in the presence of oxygen. Both spectra exhibit strong Al lines,
   weak Al+ lines and very weak molecular features, among which bandheads
   of the Delta nu = 0, +/-1, +/-2 sequences of the AlO B(2)Sigma
   (+)-X(2)Sigma (+) system have been identified. The internal energy
   distribution of the AlO B state, determined by simulation of the B-X
   system, shows that both techniques yield highly vibrationally and
   rotationally excited AlO molecules in the B state. Local equilibrium is
   achieved (T-rot = T-vib similar or equal to 4000 K) for the B(2)Sigma
   (+) State of AlO formed via laser ablation, in agreement with previous
   studies and with a reaction scheme proceeding through a long-lived
   intermediate. In contrast, the AlO molecules formed in the B(2)Sigma (+)
   state through fast ion beam bombardment are much more rotationally than
   vibrationally excited. The rovibronic population distributions, most
   probably highly non-thermal, can be roughly represented by thermal
   populations corresponding to rotational and vibrational temperatures of
   13 000 and 5000 K, respectively. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {High accuracy ab initio methods for computational thermochemistry have
   been applied to aluminum compounds expected to be present during
   combustion of aluminum particles. The computed enthalpies of formation
   at 298.15 It agree well with experimental values from the literature for
   AlCl, AlCl3, AlO, AlOAl, linear OAlO, planar Al2O2, AlOH, AlH, and AlN.
   The agreement is fair for AlCl2. Major revisions to the recommended
   thermochemistry must be considered for OAlCl, OAlH, OAlOH, and AlC. This
   is not surprising since the thermodynamic data for OAlCl, OAlN, OAlOH,
   and AlC are given in the literature as rough estimates. Calculated
   thermochemical data are also presented for several species never studied
   experimentally including AlH2, AlH3, AlOO, cyclic-AlO2, linear AlOAlO,
   AlHCl, AlHCl2, and others. Based on the performance of the CBS-Q and G2,
   methods observed in other systems, the calculated enthalpies of
   formation would be expected to be accurate to within +/-1 to 2 kcal
   mol(-1). However, relatively large differences between the results from
   the CBS-Q and G2 methods for the aluminum oxides indicate that the
   uncertainties are slightly larger for these compounds. The
   thermochemistry proposed here is shown to predict substantially
   different equilibrium composition from the thermochemistry previously
   available in the literature. (C) 2000 by The Combustion Institute.},
