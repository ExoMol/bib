Abstract = {In order to assess the relative importance of the intrinsic error in
   high-level conventional ab initio methods and errors inherent in the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation, benchmark quality potential curves and
   spectroscopic constants have been computed for the light diatomic
   hydrides H-2, LiH, BeH, and BH. The intrinsic error is found to be
   comparable to or smaller than the nonadiabatic effects. Revised
   spectroscopic constants are proposed for BeH. BH is predicted to have
   an unusually large nonadiabatic contribution of about 0.0025 Angstrom
   to its bond length. Previous arguments favoring the use of atomic
   rather than nuclear masses are further corroborated. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Title = {Full configuration interaction calculation of BeH adiabatic states},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {129},
Number = {5},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {An all-electron full configuration interaction (FCI) calculation of the
   adiabatic potential energy curves of some of the lower states of BeH
   molecule is presented. A moderately large ANO basis set of atomic
   natural orbitals (ANO) augmented with Rydberg functions has been used
   in order to describe the valence and Rydberg states and their
   interactions. The Rydberg set of ANOs has been placed on the Be at all
   bond distances. So, the basis set can be described as
   4s3p2d1f/3s2p1d(Be/H)+4s4p2d(Be). The dipole moments of several states
   and transition dipole strengths from the ground state are also reported
   as a function of the RBe-H distance. The position and the number of
   states involved in several avoided crossings present in this system
   have been discussed. Spectroscopic parameters have been calculated from
   a number of the vibrational states that result from the adiabatic
   curves except for some states in which this would be completely
   nonsense, as it is the case for the very distorted curves of the 3s and
   3p (2)Sigma(+) states or the double-well potential of the 4p (2)Pi
   state. The so-called ``D complex{''} at 54 050 cm(-1) (185.0 nm) is
   resolved into the three 3d substates ((2)Sigma(+),(2)Pi,(2)Delta). A
   diexcited valence state is calculated as the lowest state of
   (2)Sigma(-) symmetry and its spectroscopic parameters are reported, as
   well as those of the 2 (2)Delta (4d) state The adiabatic curve of the 4
   (2)Sigma(+) state shows a swallow well at large distances (around 4.1
   angstrom) as a result of an avoided crossing with the 3 (2)Sigma(+)
   state. The probability that some vibrational levels of this well could
   be populated is discussed within an approached Landau-Zerner model and
   is found to be high. No evidence is found of the E(4s sigma)
   (2)Sigma(+) state in the region of the ``D complex{''}. Instead, the
   spectroscopic properties obtained from the (4s sigma) 6 (2)Sigma(+)
   adiabatic curve of the present work seem to agree with those of the
   experimental F(4p sigma) (2)Sigma(+) state. The FCI calculations
   provide benchmark results for other correlation models for the
   open-shell BeH system and evidence both the limitations and
   capabilities of the basis set. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {An iterative procedure, involving the use of an elliptical basis set, natural orbitals, "pair equations,"

D) was obtained. Population analysis of the molecular wavefunctions was done to investigate the nature
of the chemical bond involved. Less complex calculations involving configuration interaction were also
done for the low-lying excited states at nine different internuclear separations. Potential energy curves were plotted. The transition energy obtained (2JI->22:) was found to be within 1.3% of the experimental value.
Transition probabilities were also considered.},

Abstract = {The A (2)Pi-X (2)Sigma(+) transition of BeH was observed by Fourier
   transform emission spectroscopy using a hollow cathode discharge lamp.
   The 0-0 to 6-6 bands were rotationally analyzed and molecular constants
   extracted. The equilibrium rotational constants B-e and bond lengths
   were found to be 10.331 21(50) cm(-1) and 1.341 68(3) Angstrom for the

   determine the vibrational constants, the 0-1 to 6-7 bands in an
   archival are emission spectrum were also rotationally analyzed. In the
   X (2)Sigma(+) and A (2)Pi states, the spectroscopic constants are
   nearly identical so the Delta nu = -1 bands were too weak to be seen in
   our Fourier transform spectra. Franck-Condon factors were calculated
   for the A (2)Pi-X (2)Sigma(+) transition from Rydberg-Klein-Rees
   potential curves. These new rotational analyses now link up with the

A new c'Z'-x'X' transition of BeH and BeD is observed in a beryllium arc in hydrogen or deuterium gas mixed with
argon. The rotational analysis of the most intense of these strongly red degraded bands, which involve v' = 0-2 for BeH and
v' = 0 for BeD, allows one to derive molecular constants for the new C'z' state. The latter has a largc intcrnuclear equilibrium
distance (r, = 2.301 A) and a shallow potential energy minimum (D: = 8452 2 100 cm I ) . The principal molecular constants
determined are:
c'Z' T, = 30 953.94 cm-1
BeH: w, = 1061.12, w,s, = 42.19, o,y, = 4.22, B, = 3.5141 cm-1
BeD: o, = 787.40, w,.r, = 23.23, o,y, = 1.72, B, = 1.9367 cm-1
Rotational perturbations between the C'C' and ~ ' 1 ~sta1te s are observed in the C-X bands of BeH and BeD and in two new
A-X bands of BeH (4-4 and 5-5) which have also been observed and analyzed. These perturbations are treated by a matrix
approach and yield a value for the interaction matrix element ( A ' ~ / L ' I C ~ C ' ) = 0.88.
The C-X bands analyzed involve the higher vibrational levels of the x'C' state rand allow, therefore, a substantial
improvement of the ground state molecular constants to be made and a good Rydbcrg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential energy
curve to be calculated. The limiting curve of the predissociation confirms the previous value of the dissociation energy (D:
= 17 426 r 100 cm-I) and indicates that a small maximum, less than 200 ern-.', could exist at r = 3.3 A in the ground state
potential energy curve.
Franck-Condon factors for the c'C+-x'Z' bands of BeH and BeD are also calculated.},

Pages = {4027-4036},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Using a linear-response approach, the recently introduced
   spin-restricted coupled-cluster (SR-CC) theory is extended to the
   treatment of excited states of high-spin open-shell molecules. Explicit
   equations are given within the usual singles and doubles approximation
   and our implementation (within an existing spin-orbital code) is
   described. It is shown that in SR-CC theory, due to spin constraints,
   the spin-expectation value for the excited states calculated as
   corresponding energy derivatives always corresponds to the exact value.
   In addition, the SR-CC singles and doubles (SR-CCSD) approach is
   extended to include also the so-called pseudotriple excitations (best
   described as double excitations with an additional spin-flip in one
   open-shell orbital) which are important for the description of so-called
   low-spin excited states. Exploratory calculations for a few diatomic
   systems (BeH, OH, NO, CN, and CO(+)) show that problems due to spin
   contamination in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) CCSD treatment of
   excited states are rectified by using a restricted open-shell
   Hartree-Fock (ROHF) reference, as it is done in the SR-CC approach.
   While SR-CCSD performs well for high-spin excited states, the closely
   related partially spin-adapted (PSA) CC approach is shown to be inferior
   and errors in the computed excitation energies are generally larger than
   the typical accuracy of about 0.2 eV in CCSD excited state treatments.
   So-called low-spin states (e.g., the 2 (2)B(1) state of NH(2)) are shown
   to require inclusion of pseudotriple excitations for even a
   qualitatively correct description. If they are included, ROHF-CC, SR-CC,
   and PSA-CC give essentially identical results. (C) 2000 American

   in the 19500-20800 cm(-1) spectral region using a Fourier transform
   spectrometer. The emission spectrum was excited in a Be hollow cathode
   discharge lamp with a He/D, gas mixture. The observed lines were
   assigned to the 0-0 to 6-6 bands. The Delta upsilon = -1 sequence was
   too weak to be seen in our Fourier transform spectra. We therefore used
   a previously recorded but unpublished are emission spectrum to identify
   the: 0-1 to 5-6 by = -1 bands. Consequently, all of the diagonal bands
   could be linked together and the vibrational intervals determined. The
   Delta upsilon = 0 and Delta upsilon = -1 data were fitted together in a
   global fit and effective constants derived. Using the information
   available from the study of the C(2)Sigma(+)-X(2)Sigma(+) system {[}R.
   Colin, C. Dreze, and M. Steinhauer, Can, J. Phys. 61, 641 (1983)], the

   Dunham fit. A set of Dunham Y constants was determined for the
   X(2)Sigma(+) state along with traditional equilibrium parameters for the
   A(2)Pi excited state. The equilibrium bond lengths were found to be
   1.341742(5) Angstrom for the ground state and 1.33309(4) Angstrom. for

Abstract = {Spectra in the visible range may be obtained along multiple lines of
   sight directed at the axisymmetric poloidal divertor of the JET tokamak.
   In X-point magnetic field configurations, the scrape-off-layer plasma
   contacts the divertor target plates. We have conducted observations and
   analysis of diatomic spectra in the divertor plasma along lines of sight
   in the strike zone vicinity. We have identified unambiguously CD, C-2
   and BeD. Synthetic spectra have been calculated. In addition to
   identification of the molecular features and separation of overlapping
   atomic lines, the comparison of simulations and observations allow quite
   sensitive determination of rotational and vibrational temperatures for
   the above diatomics in a divertor fusion plasma. Systematic studies show
   that T-r and T-v are comparable for BeD but T-v is significantly less
   than T-r for CD and C-2. The BeD spectrum time history during a pulse
   (modulated by sweeping) appears as localized emission from the strike
   points similar to that of the atomic Bet visible spectrum lines. On the
   other hand, the CD bands during a swept pulse: indicate a more
   distributed source. Thus both the BeD spectrum and time history suggest
   physical sputtering of BeD at the strike points. In contrast, the CD
   spectrum and time history indicate chemical release of higher deuterides
   followed by catabolism to CD. This work constitutes the first detailed
   study of diatomic species in the JET tokamak.},

   Calculations have been carried out for the first-row hydrides LiH to FH

   with accuracies of 0.5 kcal mol(-1) or better. For all hydrides, the

Abstract = {This paper is the first part of a series devoted to the ab initio
   calculation of some vibrational properties helpful in the interpretation
   of high resolution spectroscopy, atmospherical and astrophysical data.
   An ab initio method of calculation of the vibrational transition
   energies and dipole moment matrix elements is described and analyzed.
   The main features of this method are the resolution of both electronic
   and vibrational problems by analytical variational techniques and the
   representation of the potential energy and dipole moment hypersurfaces
   as Taylor's series expansions in normal coordinates up to the fourth
   order. The dipole moment matrix elements are then evaluated by simple
   analytical formulae. In this first paper, some of the approximations
   inherent to the methodology are systematically analyzed on the basis of
   results obtained for diatomic molecules (BeH, HF, NH and NO) with a
   comparison to experimental and other theoretical results found in the
   literature. The dependence on the results of the effects of electrical
   and mechanical anharmonicities, electron correlation and basis set
   dependencies are investigated. The applicability of the method to small
   polyatomic systems is discussed in the second paper of this series, on
   the basis of test calculations on the water molecule.},

   not in CO+(2-PI) because the Pauli repulsion depends on the orbital

Abstract = {The absorption and the emission spectra of the BeH and BeD molecules in

   by the C2-SIGMA+ state.  Rotational constants for the v = 0 and v = 1
   levels of the 3d state are derived by matrix diagonalization techniques,
   assuming interaction with the F(4p-sigma)2-SIGMA+ state.  A tentative
   assignment of previously observed absorption bands to transitions

Abstract = {Electron-spin magnetic moments, in the form of g-shifts, have been
   computed at the ROHF level for the X(2) Sigma(+) states of LiH+, BeH2+,
   LiH-, BeH and BH+. A perturbative approach, complete to second-order in
   appropriate Breit-Pauli operators, has been used. Retention of
   two-centre integrals has proven vital. First-order terms are important,
   especially in describing the negative g(1) shifts observed
   experimentally in (2) Sigma(+) molecules. The relativistic mass
   correction dominates in first-order, except for LiH- where the
   two-electron spin-Zeeman gauge correction supersedes. Second-order terms
   contribute negatively, and only to the Delta g(perpendicular to)
   component. Along the isoelectronic series LIH(-) --> BeH --> BH+, the
   magnitude of Delta g(perpendicular to) increases due to the dependence
   of spin-orbit coupling on nuclear charge. The relation of g-shifts to
   electronic structure and bonding is explored.},

Abstract = {The accurate ground-state potential energy function of beryllium
   monohydride, BeH, has been determined from large-scale ab initio
   calculations using the multi-reference averaged coupled-pair functional
   (MR-ACPF) method in conjunction with the correlation-consistent
   core-valence basis sets up to septuple-zeta quality. The effects of
   electron correlation beyond the MR-ACPF level of approximation were
   taken into account. The scalar relativistic and adiabatic (the diagonal
   correction) effects, as well as some of the nonadiabatic effects, were
   also discussed. The vibration-rotation energy levels of three
   isotopologues, BeH, BeD, and BeT, were predicted to sub-cm(-1) accuracy.

Title = {A search for absorption of Mg and Ca compounds in molecular clouds

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {301},
Pages = {872-880},
Abstract = {Absorption lines of MgH and CaH N = 1 - 0 transitions were searched For
   in foreground molecular clouds towards the continuum sources associated
   with Sgr B2 (M) and W49A (N). None of these Lines was detected with our
   sensitivity level of similar to 20 mK, Millimetric absorption lines of
   MgO, MgOH, CaO and CaOH were also searched for towards Sgr B2 (M)
   without success. The fractional abundances relative to molecular
   hydrogen are less than or similar to 1.0 x 10(-11) for MgH, less than or
   similar to 7.9 x 10(-13) for MgO, less than or similar to 1.6 x 10(-10)
   for MgOH, less than or similar to 1.6 x 10(-9) for CaH, less than or
   similar to 2.0 x 10(-12) for CaO, and less than or similar to 2.5 x
   10(-10) for CaOH, respectively. The low abundances measured in
   absorption indicate that a significant fraction of interstellar
   magnesium and calcium cannot be tied up in their monohydrides, monoxides
   and monohydroxides. The law abundance of MgH also implies that
   grain-surface chemistry involving magnesium is not efficient and that
   magnesium is depleted on to grains to a factor of greater than or
   similar to 10(2.5) in well-shielded molecular clouds.},
