Abstract = {The radiative properties of the doubly-excited states
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2) of C2 and
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) of C2+ are investigated
   theoretically by using MRD-CI wave functions.  Due to a heavy mixing
   between bonding and antibonding configurations, the E state (with a
   maximum contribution of sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2 of 45\%) does not show
   the typical features of strongly bound states (short R(e) and high
   omega(e)).  Because of the mixing, the experimental Freymark system
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+ - A(1)PI(u) of C2 exhibits a moderate intensity though.
   At R = 2.43 bohr (an intermediate geometry between both minima), a
   calculated transition moment SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.151 au2 disagrees
   with an experimental estimate of 2.26 +/- 1.13 au2 from Cooper and
   Nicholls.  The same authors assigned to the Mulliken band D(1)SIGMA(u)+
   - X(1)SIGMA(g)+ of C2 a SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.13 +/- 0.05 au2, whereas
   this work and earlier data from the literature indicate a higher value
   of 0.41 au2 for that quantity.  A total radiative lifetime tau(0)
   almost-equal-to 15 ns for the E(1)SIGMA(g)+ state is mainly dicated by
   the radiative process E --> A, the competitive decay E --> D being
   about 10 times slower.  The 2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) state
   of C2+ is strongly bound, with a shortening DELTA-R(e) = 0.35 bohr and
   an increase DELTA-omega(e) almost-equal-to 800 cm-1 (60\%) relative to
   the X(4)SIGMA(g)- ground state.  A lifetime tau(0)(2(2)SIGMA(g)+)
   almost-equal-to 28 ns results from radiative decay into both
   1(2)SIGMA(u)+ and 2(2)PI(u) states.  On the basis of the present
   spectroscopic data for C2+, an absorption band observed at 2.77 eV
   (assumed as belonging to C2) is tentatively reassigned to the
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+ <-- 1(2)SIGMA(u)+ transition of C2+, with a calculated
   DELTA-E00 = 2.81 eV.},

Abstract = {Coupled-cluster methods including effects of triple excitations have
   been used with large basis sets to study several electronic states of
   C2, C2-, and C2+. r(e), omega(e), D(e), and T(e) have been computed for
   each state considered.  For those states for which experimental data
   are available, the errors are typically less than 0.002 angstrom, 20
   cm-1, and 0.1 eV for r(e), omega(e), and D(e), respectively.  These
   errors are comparable with the best previous results on C2 and
   significantly smaller than those for previous calculations on C2- and
   C2+.  For T(e) the results are also satisfactory and comparable with
   previous work, but some difficulties arise when one or both of the
   states have considerable multireference character.  For two states of
   C2+ not experimentally characterized, the present data should be
   sufficiently accurate to be of some assistance to experimental studies.
    The electron affinity of the ground state of C2 and the ionization
   potentials of the ground and first excited states of C2 have been
   computed, and particular attention has been given to correlation errors
   in these quantities.  It has been shown that triple excitations
   significantly decrease the electron affinity.  By neglecting or taking
   insufficient account of triple excitations, some previous calculations
   were biased towards the anion and obtained fortuitously good agreement
   with experiment.  The correlation error of the present calculations is
   such that the calculations are slightly biased towards the neutral
   molecule, but the error is only 0.2 eV.  For the ionization potentials,
   too, triple excitations play an important role.  Reasonable agreement
   with experiment has been achieved by the present calculations.
   Overall, the present study:  (1) underscores the importance of triple
   excitations; (2) shows the success of single-reference couple-cluster
   theory in calculating properties of a single state, even when that
   state has considerable multireference character; and (3) highlights the
   care which must be taken when comparing different electronic states
   with these methods when one or both states have considerable
   multireference character.},

Abstract = {We report ab initio spectroscopic constants for the recently identified

   are performed at the multi-reference configuration interaction level of
   theory with Davidson's correction using aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets and
   include core-valence correlation and relativistic corrections obtained
   with quadruple-zeta bases. Such treatment accurately reproduces the
   experimentally observed constants of the a(3)Pi(u) and other states.
   Thus, we expect our calculated omega(e) value for the 1(5)Pi(g) state
   to be within a few cm(-1), and rotational constants to be within 0.1\%
   of experiment. Agreement with available spectroscopic data is
   excellent, with the calculations strongly suggesting that the 1(5)Pi(g)

Abstract = {Unusual bonding and electronic near degeneracies make the lowest-lying

   to modeling bond-breaking reactions and excited states: sophisticated
   multireference configuration interaction and multireference
   perturbation theory methods, and a more ``black box,{''}
   single-reference approach, the completely renormalized coupled-cluster
   method. These approximate methods are assessed in light of their
   ability to reproduce the full configuration interaction potential
   energy curves for the X (1)Sigma(g)(+), B (1)Delta(g), and B-'
   (1)Sigma(g)(+) states of C-2, which are numerically exact solutions of
   the electronic Schrodinger equation within the space spanned by a
   6-31G({*}) basis set. Both the multireference methods and the
   completely renormalized coupled-cluster approach provide dramatic
   improvements over the standard single-reference methods. The
   multireference methods are nearly as reliable for this challenging test
   case as for simpler reactions which break only single bonds. The
   completely renormalized coupled-cluster approach has difficulty for
   large internuclear separations R in this case, but over the wide range

Abstract = {Radiative lifetimes of the C(2)A(1) Pi(u)-X(1) Sigma(g)(+) (Phillips)
   system have been remeasured using the High-Frequency Deflection
   technique. Using catalyzer gases, it is shown that collisional transfer
   effects are present which tend to lengthen the registered lifetimes,
   yielding too low f-values.
   The remeasured value f(2,0)(A-X) = (1.36 +/- 0.15) x 10(-3) is
   45\%-75\% larger than earlier laboratory experiments and agrees within
   the error limits with recent results obtained from spectra of zeta Oph
   as well as ab initio calculations.},

Title = {Spectroscopy of the C-2 molecule: Valence and Rydberg states in the

Journal = {CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {79},
Number = {2-3},
Pages = {653-671},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The potential curves of selected valence and Rydberg states of C-2
   lying in the 7-10 eV region are reported for the first time. The states
   studied, using MRCI wave functions, include (2-5)(3,1)Pi (u),
   (1-3)(3)Sigma (+)(g), (2-5)(3)Sigma (g-), (1-3)(3)(g), and relevant
   quintet stares. The f (3)Sigmag(-), g(3)Deltag and F (1)Pi (u) states
   observed in absorption from 8.88 to 9.25 eV by Herzberg et al. have
   originally been assumed to be pi (u) --> 3s Rydberg states, with
   respect to a (3)Pi (u)(1 (3)Pi (u)) for the triplets and to X(1)Sigma
   (+)(g) for the singlet. Our calculations partially support such
   assignments: f (3)Sigma (-)(g) corresponding to 3 (3)Sigma (-)(g) has
   mixed valence sigma (u)sigma (g)pi (u) (3)pi (g) and Rydberg sigma
   (2)(u)sigma (g)pi (u) (2)3s character g(3)Delta (g) corresponding to
   2(3)Delta (g) has a valence sigma (u)sigma (g)pi (u) (3)pi (g),
   structure, while F(1)Pi (u)(2(1)Pi (u)) is confirmed to be a sigma (u)
   (2)pi (u) (3)3s state. The calculated f(00)-values for these bands are
   0.027 for f <-- a, 0.051 for g <-- a, and 0.098 for F <-- X. The
   singlet-singlet transition F <-- X constitutes the strongest absorption
   band reported so far for C-2. Our theoretical value agrees with f(00)(F
   <-- X) = 0.10 +/- 0.01 derived indirectly from interstellar data
   collected by the Hubble Space Telescope. The 1 (3) Sigma (+)(g) (sigma
   (u)sigma (g)pi (u) (3)pi (g)) state at T-e = 7.57 eV lies much higher
   than expected by experimentalists.},

Abstract = {Interstellar C-2 F-X (1342 Angstrom) and D-X (2313 Angstrom) bands in

   f-value of 0.0545 for the 2313 Angstrom band of the Mulliken (D-X)
   system. Relative f-values for the 0-0 F-X, 0-0 D-X, and 2-0 A-X
   (Phillips) bands are derived by combining ultraviolet and near-infrared
   spectra: f(00)(FX)/f(00)(DX) = 1.83 +/- 0.18 and f(20)(AX)/f(00)(DX) =
   0.0226 +/- 0.0029. For the Mulliken system, lines are detected up to a

   environmental conditions suggested by other diagnostics. Interstellar

Abstract = {A new band system of C-2, e (3)Pi(g)-c (3)Sigma(+)(u) was studied by ab
   initio quantum chemical and experimental methods. The calculations were
   carried out at the multireference configuration interaction level of
   theory with Davidson's correction using aug-cc-pV6Z basis set and
   include core and core-valence correlation as well as relativistic
   corrections computed with aug-cc-pCVQZ and cc-pVQZ bases, respectively.
   The vibrational energies and rotational constants of the upper e
   (3)Pi(g) state were calculated from the computed ab initio potential
   energy curve. The ab initio results indicate that the electronic
   transition moment of the e (3)Pi(g)-c (3)Sigma(+)(u) system is
   approximately one-half that of the Fox-Herzberg e (3)Pi(g)-a (3)Pi(u)
   system. Franck-Condon factors were calculated for both systems and used
   to guide experiments aimed at discovering the e (3)Pi(g)-c
   (3)Sigma(+)(u) system. The e (3)Pi(g)(v(')=4)-c (3)Sigma(+)(u)(v(')=3)
   band of jet-cooled C-2 was successfully observed by laser-induced
   fluorescence spectroscopy by monitoring the ensuing e (3)Pi(g)-a
   (3)Pi(u) emission.},

Title = {The Swan system of C-2: A global analysis of Fourier transform emission
   spectra},
Journal = ApJS,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {169},
Number = {2},
Pages = {472-484},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The C-2 Swan system (d(3)Pi(g)-a(3)Pi(u)) was observed in emission for
   the Delta v = -3 to Delta v = +2 sequences in the 14,000-24,000 cm(-1)
   spectral range using a Fourier transform spectrometer. We carried out a
   global simultaneous fit by including a wide range of vibrational states.
   A total of 34 bands with v' = 0-10 and v `' = 0-9 were rotationally
   assigned. Numerous discrepancies were found in the assignments and in
   the measured transition wavenumbers between the new measurements and
   previous results. Most of the measured transition wavenumbers and their
   assignments for relatively low-v bands agreed with published data. On
   the contrary, for high-v bands our line positions and assignments
   disagreed with the tabulated literature values. In particular, the lines
   of six bands involving the levels with v' = 4, 5, and 6 are almost
   completely different from the previous work. Major sources of the
   disagreement are thought to be line congestion and perturbations found
   in these bands. From the analysis, perturbations for v' = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,
   8, 9, and 10 in the d(3)Pi(g) state were identified. A study of these
   rotational perturbations suggest that some of them are likely caused by
   interactions with high-v levels of the b (3)Sigma(-)(g) state.}}
