Abstract = {{The smallest polyatomic carbon chain, C-3, has been identified in
   interstellar clouds (A(upsilon)similar to 1 mag) toward zeta Ophiuchi,
   20 Aquilae and zeta Persei by detection of the origin band in its
   A(1)II(u)-X(1)Sigma (+)(g) electronic transition, near 4052 Angstrom.
   Individual rotational lines were resolved up to J = 30, allowing the
   rotational-level column densities and temperature distributions to be
   determined. The inferred limits for the total column densities (similar
   to1-2 x 10(12) cm(-2)) offer a strong incentive to laboratory and
   astrophysical searches for the longer carbon chains. Concurrent searches
   for C-2(+), C-2(-), and C-3(-) were negative, but provide sensitive
   estimates for their maximum column densities.}}

Abstract = {We report here the first observation of the D (1)Delta(g) state of the C-3 radical, which provides the first comprehensively analyzed example
   of the dynamic Renner-Teller splitting in Delta symmetry. Two color
   double resonance spectroscopy via the A (1)Pi(u) state was employed to
   experimentally probe an extensive range of vibronic levels in this D
   (1)Delta(g) state, covering all three modes of vibration of C-3. The
   analysis was supported by ab initio potential energy surface
   calculations on the C-3 radical to outline the lowest eight singlet
   electronic states. Two methods were used to analyze the Renner-Teller
   effect. The first method is an empirical Hamiltonian based on normal
   modes, using harmonic oscillator functions as a basis, with
   Renner-Teller and other terms added as required, which allows
   conventional vibrational parameters to be determined. The second is a
   much larger program that uses the exact kinetic energy operator for a
   triatomic molecule to calculate vibronic energy levels directly from
   the Renner-Teller pair of potential energy surfaces. Both methods give
   a good fit to the experimental results, with only a small adjustment to
   the ab initio surfaces required for the latter. One of the overall
   conclusions is that the Renner-Teller effect is rather smaller in the D
   (1)Delta(g) state than in the A (1)Pi(u) state.}}

Abstract = {{The vibrational structure of the (A) over bar (1)Pi(u) electronic state
   of C-3 in the region 26 000-30 775 cm(-1) has been re-examined, using
   laser excitation spectra of jet-cooled molecules. Rotational constants
   and vibrational energies have been determined for over 60
   previously-unreported vibronic levels: a number of other levels have
   been re-assigned. The vibrational structure is complicated by
   interactions between levels of the upper and lower Born-Oppenheimer
   components of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, and by the effects of
   the double minimum potential in the Q(3) coordinate, recognized by Izuha
   and Yamanouchi {[}16]. The present work shows that there is also strong
   anharmonic resonance between the overtones of the v(1) and v(3)
   vibrations. For instance, the levels 2 1(+)1 and 0 1(+)3 are nearly
   degenerate in zero order, but as a result of the resonance they give
   rise to two levels 139 cm(-1) apart, centered about the expected
   position of the 2 1(+)1 level. With these irregularities recognized,
   every observed vibrational level up to 30 000 cm(-1) (a vibrational
   energy of over 5000 cm(-1)) can now be assigned. A Sigma(+)(u) vibronic
   level at 30181.4 cm(-1), which has a much lower B' rotational constant
   than nearby levels of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, possibly
   represents the onset of vibronic perturbations by the (B) over
   tilde'(1)Delta(u) electronic state; this state is so far unknown, but is
   predicted by the ab initio calculations of Ahmed et al. {[}36].}},

Abstract = {{Rotational analyses have been carried out at high resolution for the
   000-000 and 000-100 bands of the A (1)Pi(u)-X (1)Sigma(g)(+) transition
   of supersonic jet-cooled C-3. Two different spectra have been recorded
   for each band, using time gatings of 20-150 and 800-2300 ns. At the
   shorter time delay the spectra show only the lines observed by many
   previous workers. At the longer time delay many extra lines appear, some
   of which have been observed previously by {[}McCall Chem. Phys. Lett.
   374, 583 (2003)] in cavity ring-down spectra of jet-cooled C-3. Detailed
   analysis of these extra lines shows that at least two long-lived states
   perturb the A (1)Pi(u), 000 state. One of these appears to be a
   (3)Sigma(u)(-) vibronic state, which may possibly be a high vibrational
   level of the b (3)Pi(g) state, and the other appears to be a P=1 state
   with a low rotational constant B. Our spectra also confirm the
   reassignment by McCall of the R(0) line of the 000-000 band, which is
   consistent with the spectra recorded towards a number of stars that
   indicate the presence of C-3 in the interstellar medium. Fluorescence
   lifetimes have been measured for a number of upper-state rotational
   levels. The rotational levels of the A (1)Pi(u) state have lifetimes in
   the range of 230-190 ns, decreasing slightly with J; the levels of the
   perturbing states have much longer lifetimes, with some of them showing
   biexponential decays. An improved value has been obtained for the nu(1)
   vibrational frequency of the ground state, nu(1)=1224.4933 +/- 0.0029
