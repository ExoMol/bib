   application to {CH$_4$}},

Abstract = {Aim. We describe an ab initio-based numerical method of obtaining
   infrared spectroscopic data ( line list) of polyatomic molecules that
   allows calculation of complete sets of lines for temperatures up to
   several thousand Kelvin. While the main focus is on completeness and
   consistency, not spectroscopic accuracy, the approach is in principle
   ``exact{''} for line positions and, although not exact for line
   strengths, of sufficient accuracy to be of value, especially in
   wavelength regions where there are gaps in reliable experimental data.
   Methods. Global potential energy and dipole moment hypersurfaces are
   fitted to the results of ab initio electronic structure calculations.
   The MULTIMODE software is then used to obtain rovibrational energy
   levels and dipole transition matrix elements. This information is used
   to calculate a complete set of Einstein coefficients of spontaneous
   emission A(ij).
   Results. The method is applied to obtain a spectroscopic database for
   methane containing over 1.4 million lines up to an upper state energy
   of 6200 cm(-1) (similar to 9000 K). The emission spectrum of CH4 at
   1000 K is calculated with the complete set of Einstein coefficients and
   compared with the one obtained from the HITRAN database. Gaps in the
   database are realistically filled in by the calculated spectrum.
   Conclusions. Consistent and complete databases are important for
   astrophysical applications. Databases obtained by the method described
   here fulfill this requirement and are sufficiently accurate for
   astrophysical applications such as model atmosphere calculations and
   the corresponding synthetic spectra.}

Abstract = {A new potential energy surface of methane is constructed using extended
   ab initio CCSD(T) calculations at 19 882 points. Its analytical
   representation is determined through an expansion in symmetry adapted
   products of orthogonal coordinates involving 276 parameters up to 8th
   order with the equilibrium bond r(e) = 1.08601 +/- 0.00004 angstrom and
   four quadratic parameters scaled to experimental fundamental vibration
   frequencies. Variational calculations give RMS (obs.-calc.) deviations
   of 0.085 and 0.25 cm(1) for vibration levels of the pentad and octad.
   Rotational energies up to J = 10 are calculated using potential
   expansion in normal coordinate tensors with maximum errors of 0.0007 and
   0.0003 cm (1) for (12)CH(4) and (13)CH(4). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {We present the current status of PHOENIX model atmospheres dwarfs of the
   spectral type T, typical for older field brown dwarfs and low-mass brown
   dwarfs. The results are based on new predictions of the CH4 line
   opacities from theoretical calculations with the STDS software package,
   extrapolating to transitions from rotational levels up to J = 40. While
   individual line positions and strengths are reproduced with moderate to
   fair accuracy, the cumulative band strength in the region of the IR
   methane bands is modelled much better thanks to the-inclusion of large
   numbers of faint lines relevant at high temperatures.}}

   water vapor. Water and methane are both shown to be strong absorbers in
