abstract = "Here we present a laboratory study of CO2 absorption spectra, obtained at high temperatures and pressures, similar to those encountered in the Venusian atmosphere. These spectra have been recorded using a Fourier Transform InfraRed (FT-IR) spectrometer , which is equipped to operate from 800 to 30,000&#xa0;cm−1 ( 0.33 – 12.5 μ m ) with a resolution from 0.06 to 10&#xa0;cm−1. A dedicated gas cell, designed to support pressures up to 200&#xa0;bar and temperatures up to 350&#xa0;°C, has been coupled to the FT-IR. Starting from a realistic vertical pressure–temperature profile of the Venus' atmosphere, based on measurements performed with atmospheric probes, we have recorded a series of absorption spectra of CO2, varying the pressure and temperature from 1 to 50&#xa0;bar and from 294 to 650K."

Title = {{CDSD-4000: High-resolution, high-temperature carbon dioxide
   spectroscopic databank}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {1403-1410},
Abstract = {We present a high-resolution, high-temperature version of the Carbon
   Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank called CDSD-4000. The databank contains
   the line parameters (positions, intensities, air- and self-broadened
   half-widths, coefficients of temperature dependence of air- and
   self-broadened half-widths, and air-broadened pressure shifts) of the
   four most abundant isotopologues of CO(2). A reference temperature is
   296 K and an intensity cutoff is 10(-27) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) at 4000
   K. The databank has 628,324,454 entries, covers the 226-8310 cm(-1)
   spectral range and designed for the temperature range 2500-5000 K.
   Format of CDSD-4000 is similar to that of HITRAN-2008. The databank has
   been generated within the framework of the method of effective operators
   and based on the global fittings of spectroscopic parameters (parameters
   of the effective Hamiltonians and effective dipole moment operators) to
   observed data collected from the literature. The databank is useful for
   studying high-temperature radiative properties of CO(2), including
   exoplanets atmospheres, aerothemal modeling for Mars entry missions,
   high-temperature laboratory spectra, and industrial applications.

Title = {An Isotopic-Independent Highly-Accurate Potential Energy Surface for CO$_2$ Isotopologues and an Initial $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ IR Line list},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2012},
volume = {136},
pages = {124311},
abstract={{An isotopic-independent, highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) has been determined for CO2 by refining a purely ab initio PES with selected, purely experimentally determined rovibrational energy levels. The purely ab initio PES is denoted Ames-0, while the refined PES is denoted Ames-1. Detailed tests are performed to demonstrate the spectroscopic accuracy of the Ames-1 PES. It is shown that Ames-1 yields σrms (Root-Mean-Squares Error)= 0.0156 cm-1 for 6873 J=0-117 12C16O2 experimental energy levels, even though less than 500 12C16O2 energy levels were included in the refinement procedure. It is also demonstrated that, without any additional refinement, Ames-1 yields very good agreement for isotopologues. Specifically, for the 12C16O2 and 13C16O2 isotopologues, spectroscopic constants Gv computed
from Ames-1 are within {plus minus}0.01 - 0.02 cm-1 of reliable experimentally derived values, while for the 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O, 16O13C18O, 16O13C17O, 12C18O2, 17O12C18O, 12C17O2, 13C18O2, 13C17O2, 17O13C18O, and 14C16O2 isotopologues the differences are between {plus minus}0.10 - 0.15 cm-1. To our knowledge, this is the first time a polyatomic PES has been refined using such high J values, and this has led to new challenges in the refinement procedure. An initial high quality, purely ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is constructed and used to generate a 296K line list. For most bands,
experimental IR intensities are well reproduced for 12C16O2 using Ames-1 and the DMS. For more than 80\% of the bands, the experimental intensities are reproduced with σrms(ΔI)<20\% or σrms(ΔI/δobs)<5. A few exceptions are analyzed and discussed. Directions for future improvements are discussed, though it is concluded that the current Ames-1 and the DMS should be useful in analyzing and assigning high-resolution laboratory or astronomical spectra.}} }

Title = {{Micropulse differential absorption lidar for identification of carbon
   sequestration site leakage}},
Journal = AO,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {2994-3003},
Abstract = {{A scanning differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument for
   identification of carbon dioxide leaks at carbon sequestration sites has
   been developed and initial data has been collected at Montana State
   University. The laser transmitter uses two tunable discrete mode laser
   diodes operating in the continuous-wave mode with one locked to the
   online absorption wavelength and the other operating at the offline
   wavelength. Two in-line fiber optic switches are used to switch between
   online and offline operation. After the fiber optic switch, an
   acousto-optic modulator is used to generate a pulse train used to
   injection seed an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to produce eye-safe laser
   pulses with maximum pulse energies of 66 mu J, a pulse repetition
   frequency of 15 kHz, and an operating wavelength of 1.571 mu m. The DIAL
   receiver uses a 28 cm diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to collect
   that backscattered light, which is then monitored using a
   photomultiplier tube module operating in the photon counting mode. The
   DIAL has measured carbon dioxide profiles from 1 to 2.5 km with 60 min
   temporal averaging. Comparisons of DIAL measurements with a Licor LI-820
   gas analyzer point sensor have been made. }},
