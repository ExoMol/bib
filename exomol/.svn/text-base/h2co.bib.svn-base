  journal = JCP,
  year = {1993},
  volume = {99},
  pages = {8519-8541},
  abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
	levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The
	method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
	of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
	iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
	vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
	as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions
	in each off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more
	than cn(f+1) multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates.
	Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation
	(DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal.
	The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by
	the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions)
	at most two. The n(f+1) scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed
	second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to
	any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety
	of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond),
	for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic
	energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged
	band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1,
	and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results
	for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify the causes of discrepancies
	in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices
	(up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within
	an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using
	explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule
	and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos
	method to all the examples presented here with a single computer
	program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality,
	and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly
	with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

	Polyoxymethylene [formaldehyde polymer: (-CH 2 -O-) n , also called

	multiphase chemistry: POM in the solid state on cometary grains slowly
	degrades by solar photons and heat and produces H 2 CO in the gaseous
	phase. This is a new approach to cometary organic chemistry. We show,
	by considering simple assumptions about the cometary environment,
	that the hypothesis of POM on grains leads to a very good agreement
	with Giotto observations if we assume that the cometary grains are
	~7% POM by mass at a temperature of 330 K.},

	near the position of the P(40) line that we attribute to CO fluorescence
	from a non-thermal high J rotational population produced by photodissociation
	of formaldehyde into CO and H(2). This process also leaves the H(2)
	preferentially populated in excited vibrational levels which are
	identified by fluorescent H(2) lines in the spectrum excited by solar
	O VI lambda 1031.9 and solar Ly alpha. The amount of H(2) produced

	of 19 infrared-bright galaxies which exhibit various forms of starburst
	activity. In the five galaxies of our sample where both H2CO transitions
	were detected, we have derived spatial densities. We also use H2CO
	to estimate the dense gas mass in our starburst galaxy sample, finding
	similar mass estimates for the dense gas-forming stars in these objects
	as derived using other dense gas tracers. A related trend can be
	seen when one compares L-IR to our derived n(H-2) for the five galaxies

	the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12 m telescope at 1.2 and 2 mm.
	Aperture synthesis maps of H 2 CO at 3 mm were made using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
	Association (BIMA) interferometer toward comet Hale-Bopp. These data
	indicate that the production rate of H 2 CO is ~3.7 × 10 28 s -1
	at ~1 AU in comet Hale-Bopp, using a simple Monte Carlo model, if
	a nuclear origin for the molecule is assumed. However, maps of H
	2 CO in Hale-Bopp, in comparison with CO, show an extended distribution
	( r s ~ 15,000 km) with small-scale structure oriented roughly along
	the comet-Sun direction. This result suggests a source of H 2 CO
	other than the comet nucleus. The extended source of formaldehyde
	is probably grains composed of a mixture of silicates and organic
	material. The production rate for H 2 CO increases to Q ~ 1.4 × 10
	29 s -1 assuming such an extended grain source. This value implies

  pages = {541},
  abstract = {Formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and methanol (CH 3 OH) are thought to be produced
	in the interstellar medium by the successive hydrogenation of carbon
	monoxide (CO) on grain surfaces. In the gas phase, the steps in which
	H adds to CO and H 2 CO possess modest barriers and are too inefficient
	to account for the observed abundances. Recent laboratory work has
	confirmed that formaldehyde and methanol are formed when H atoms
	are deposited on CO ice at 12 K. The present study employs ab initio
	quantum chemical calculations to investigate the impact of water
	ice on the sequential hydrogenation of CO. The most favorable pathway
	is CO → HCO (formyl radical) → H 2 CO → CH 3 O (methoxy radical)
	→ CH 3 OH. There is sufficient reaction energy in the final step
	to fragment CH 3 OH into methyl and hydroxyl radicals, which can
	be hydrogenated to yield methane and water, as observed in the experimental
	work. The emphasis here was on the two steps with barriers, H + CO
	and H + H 2 CO, with both addition and abstraction considered for
	the latter. Calculations with up to four explicit water molecules
	were performed, as well as further modeling to incorporate bulk effects.
	While ice was found to have a nearly negligible impact on H + CO
	→ HCO, it modestly enhances the addition reaction H + H 2 CO → CH
	3 O and hinders the abstraction reaction H + H 2 CO → H 2 + HCO.
	The deuterium-substituted reactions D + CO → DCO and D + H 2 CO →
	CDH 2 O were found to be slightly favored over the corresponding
	H reactions, particularly in the latter case. Overall, the energetics
	are not favorable: water ice is evidently not a good catalytic substrate
	for H + CO or H + H 2 CO addition reactions at very cold temperatures.},

  abstract = {We report a new "spectroscopic" potential energy surface (PES) of
	formaldehyde (H(2)(12)C(16)O) in its ground electronic state, obtained
	by refining an ab initio PES in a least-squares fitting to the experimental
	spectroscopic data for formaldehyde currently available in the literature.
	The ab initio PES was computed using the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ method
	at 30 840 geometries that cover the energy range up to 44 000 cm(-1)

	and P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 245, 126 (2007)]. The parameter
	values in the analytical representation of the PES were optimized
	in fittings to 319 ro-vibrational energies with J = 0, 1, 2, and
	5. The initial parameter values in the fittings were those of the
	ab initio PES, the ro-vibrational eigenfunctions obtained from this
	PES served as a basis set during the fitting process, and constraints
	were imposed to ensure that the refined PES does not deviate unphysically
	from the ab initio one in regions of configuration space not sampled
