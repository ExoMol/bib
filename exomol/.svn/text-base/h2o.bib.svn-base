Title = {{Search for interstellar water in the translucent molecular cloud toward
   HD 154368}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{503}},
Pages = {{780-784}},
Abstract = {{We report an upper limit of 9 x 10(12) cm(-2) on the column density of
   water in the translucent cloud along the line of sight toward HD 154368.
   This result is based on a search for the C-X band of water near 1240
   Angstrom carried out using the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph
   (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observational Limit on the
   water abundance, together with detailed chemical models of translucent
   clouds and previous measurements of OH along the line of sight,
   constrains the branching ratio in the dissociative recombination of H3O+
   to form water. We find at the 3 sigma level that no more than 30\% of
   dissociative recombinations of H3O+ can lead to H2O. The observed
   spectrum also yielded high-resolution observations of the Mg II doublet
   at 1239.9 Angstrom and 1240.4 Angstrom, allowing the velocity structure
   of the dominant ionization state of magnesium to be studied along the
   line of sight. The Mg II spectrum is consistent with GHRS observations
   at lower spectral resolution that were obtained previously but allow an
   additional velocity component to be identified.}}}

Journal = CP,
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {387-400}},
Abstract = {{The electronic excitation spectrum and the associated absolute optical
   oscillator strengths for the photoabsorption of water have been
   determined in the energy region 6-200 eV using low resolution dipole (e,
   e) spectroscopy and TRK sum-rule normalization. In addition, detailed
   studies of the absolute photoabsorption oscillator strengths for the
   valence shell discrete electronic transitions of water have been made
   using high resolution dipole (e, e) spectroscopy (0.048 eV fwhm), from
   the first excitation threshold up to 30 eV. The present results are free
   of `'line saturation'' (i.e. bandwidth/linewidth interaction) effects
   which can lead to serious errors when absolute intensity measurements
   are made using conventional Beer-Lambert law photoabsorption methods.}}}
