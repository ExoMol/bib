Year = {2011},
Volume = {269},
Pages = {77-85},
Abstract = {The {[}H,C,N] molecular system is a very important model system to many
   fields of chemical physics. The experimental characterization of highly
   excited vibrational states of this molecular system with a stable HCN
   and a metastable HNC isomer is of special interest. This work
   substantially extends the spectroscopic characterization of the
   rovibrational states of the {[}H,C, N] molecular system around the HNC
   minimum of the potential surface. The emission spectrum of the HNC
   isomer has been recorded at 1463 K using hot gas molecular emission
   (HOTGAME) spectroscopy from the far infrared up to the near infrared
   wavenumber region. The dense emission spectrum was analyzed using the
   spectrum analysis software SyMath (TM) implemented in the Mathematica
   (TM) computer algebra system. This work reports the analysis of highly
   excited rovibrational states. The rotational structure for 27
   vibrational states (0 nu(1)(2)1 states from nu(2) = 4 to nu(2) = 7, the
   0 nu(1)(2)2 from nu(2) =1 to nu(2) = 4 and 2 nu(1)(2)0 states from nu(2)
   = 3 to nu(2) = 4) have been characterized for the first time and for
   five known vibrational levels it was possible to improve the existing
   spectroscopic constants substantially. Together with the author's three
   recent papers accurate spectroscopic constants for 94 HNC rovibrational
   states have been determined. New expansion coefficients for the
   vibrational dependence of the spectroscopic constants are reported from
   the analysis of all these states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The {[}H, C, N] molecular system is a very important model system to
   many fields of chemical physics and the experimental characterization of
   highly excited vibrational states of this molecular system is of special
   interest. This paper reports the experimental characterization of all
   3822 eigenenergies up to 6880 cm(-1) relative to the ground state in the
   HCN part of the potential surface using high temperature hot gas
   emission spectroscopy. The spectroscopic constants for the first 71
   vibrational states including highly excited bending vibrations up to
   nu(2) = 10 are reported. The perturbed eigenenergies for all 20
   rotational perturbations in the reported eigenenergy range have been
   determined. The 11 070 eigenenergies up to J = 90 for the first 123
   vibrational substates are included as supplement to this paper. We show
   that a complete ab initio rovibrational analysis for a polyatomic
   molecule is possible. Using such an analysis we can understand the
   molecular physics behind the Schrodinger equation for problems for which
   perturbation theoretical calculations are no more valid. We show that
   the vibrational structure of the linear HCN molecule persists
   approximately up to the isomerization barrier and only above the barrier
   the accommodation of the vibrational states to the double well structure
   of the potential takes place. }}

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{551}},
Abstract = {{Aims. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) radiates effectively at infrared
   wavelengths in cometary atmospheres, and a new quantum-band model is
   needed to properly interpret high-resolution spectra. HCN spectra of
   comets 8P/Tuttle, C/2007 W1 (Boattini), and C/2008 Q3 (Garradd) have
   been recorded by our team using the high-resolution CRyogenic InfraRed
   Echelle Spectometer (CRIRES) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT),
   ultimately posing an excellent test for our newly developed model.
   Methods. We developed a quantum-band model for the nu(1) fundamental of
   HCN using the latest spectroscopic parameters available and with it
   retrieved HCN in the above mentioned three comets. For each comet, we
   sampled several lines of HCN in the spectral region near 3 mu m, and
   retrieved molecular production rates, mixing ratios, and rotational
   temperatures.
   Results. When compared to other comets, 8P/Tuttle is relatively depleted
   in HCN, while C/2007 W1 (Boattini) appears to be enriched and C/2008 Q3
   (Garradd) normal. The spatial profile of HCN observed in 8P/Tuttle is
   symmetric, consistent with isotropic outgassing from the nucleus, while
   in comet C/2007 W1 we observed an asymmetric excess of HCN in the
   anti-solar direction. We investigated the HCN-CN parentage by comparing
   our production rate ratios (HCN/H2O) with those of CN/OH derived at
   optical wavelengths. In comet C/2007 W1 the two mixing ratios are
   comparable, while in 8P/Tuttle our derived HCN abundance is too low to
   support the HCN molecule as the only parent of the CN radical.}},

Title = {{ORGANIC MOLECULES AND WATER IN THE INNER DISKS OF T TAURI STARS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{733}},
Abstract = {{We report high signal-to-noise Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of
   a sample of 11 classical T Tauri stars. Molecular emission from
   rotational transitions of H2O and OH and rovibrational bands of simple
   organic molecules (CO2, HCN, C2H2) is common among the sources in the
   sample. The emission shows a range in both flux and line-to-continuum
   ratio for each molecule and in the flux ratios of different molecular
   species. The gas temperatures (200-800 K) and emitting areas we derive
   are consistent with the emission originating in a warm disk atmosphere
   in the inner planet formation region at radii <2 AU. The H2O emission
   appears to form under a limited range of excitation conditions, as
   demonstrated by the similarity in relative strengths of H2O features
   from star to star and the narrow range in derived temperature and column
   density. Emission from highly excited rotational levels of OH is present
   in all stars; the OH emission flux increases with the stellar accretion
   rate, and the OH/H2O flux ratio shows a relatively small scatter. We
   interpret these results as evidence for OH production via FUV
   photodissociation of H2O in the disk surface layers. No obvious
   explanation is found for the observed range in the relative emission
   strengths of different organic molecules or in their strength with
   respect to water. We put forward the possibility that these variations
   reflect a diversity in organic abundances due to star-to-star
   differences in the C/O ratio of the inner disk gas. Stars with the
   largest HCN/H2O flux ratios in our sample have the largest disk masses.
   While larger samples are required to confirm this, we speculate that
   such a trend could result if higher mass disks are more efficient at
   planetesimal formation and sequestration of water in the outer disk,
   leading to enhanced C/O ratios and abundances of organic molecules in
   the inner disk. A comparison of our derived HCN-to-H2O column density
   ratio to comets, hot cores, and outer T Tauri star disks suggests that
   the inner disks are chemically active.}},

Abstract = {{We present ESO/VLT spectra in the 2.9-4.1 mu m range for a large sample
   of infrared stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), selected on the
   basis of MSX and 2MASS colours to be extremely dust-enshrouded AGB star
   candidates. Out of 30 targets, 28 are positively identified as carbon
   stars, significantly adding to the known population of optically
   invisible carbon stars in the LMC. We also present spectra for six
   IR-bright stars in or near three clusters in the LMC, identifying four
   of them as carbon stars and two as oxygen-rich supergiants. We analyse
   the molecular bands of C2H2 at 3.1 and 3.8 mu m, HCN at 3.57 mu m, and
   sharp absorption features in the 3.70-3.78 mu m region that we attribute
   to C2H2. There is evidence for a generally high abundance of C2H2 in LMC
   carbon stars, suggestive of high carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios at
   the low metallicity in the LMC. The low initial metallicity is also
   likely to have resulted in less abundant HCN and CS. The sample of IR
   carbon stars exhibits a range in C2H2:HCN abundance ratio. We do not
   find strong correlations between the properties of the molecular
   atmosphere and circumstellar dust envelope, but the observed differences
   in the strengths and shapes of the absorption bands can be explained by
   differences in excitation temperature. High mass-loss rates and strong
   pulsation would then be seen to be associated with a large scale height
   of the molecular atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{We have determined the abundances of HCN and HNC toward 19 nearby dark

   correlated with that of HNC. The abundance ratio of {[}HNC]/{[}HCN] is
   determined to be 0.54-4.5 in the observed dark cloud cores. These
   results are consistent with the idea that HCN and HNC are produced
   mainly by a recombination reaction of HCNH+ with electrons in dark cloud
   cores. Furthermore, the {[}HNC]/{[}HCN] ratio does not show any
   significant differences between star-forming cores and starless cores.
   The HCN and HNC abundances are compared with those fbr the OMC-1 cores
   previously reported. Although the abundances of HCN in the OMC-1 cores
   are comparable to those in the dark cloud cores, the abundances of HNC
   in OMC-1 are 1-2 orders of magnitude less than those in dark cloud

   coma and in the outer part, respectively. Although the source size of
   HNC might be slightly larger than that of HCN, the distributions of
   these two species almost agree with each other within the error limits.
   Since it has been suggested that HCN and HNC are a parent molecule and a
   product of coma chemistry, respectively, the present results indicate
   that the production of HNC is occurring in the inner coma region. We
   have calculated the density distributions of HCN and HNC in the coma of
   comet Hale-Bopp by assuming a simple chemical model. The calculated
   HNC/HCN ratio is almost constant in the coma, which is consistent with

   Vibrational Levels on Automatically Generated IMLS Potential Energy

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {4709-4721},
Abstract = {{We report here calculated J = 0 vibrational frequencies for (CH2)-C-1
   and HCN with root-mean-square error relative to available measurements
   of 2.0 cm(-1) and 3.2 cm(-1), respectively. These results are obtained
   with DVR calculations with a dense grid on ab initio potential energy
   surfaces (PESs). The ab initio electronic structure calculations
   employed are Davidson-corrected MRCI calculations with double-, triple-,
   and quadruple-zeta basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set
   (CBS) limit. In the (CH2)-C-1 case, Full Cl tests of the Davidson
   correction at small basis set levels lead to a scaling of the correction
   with the bend angle that can be profitably applied at the CBS limit.
   Core-valence corrections are added derived from CCSD(T) calculations
   with and without frozen cores. Relativistic and non-Born-Oppenheimer
   corrections are available for HCN and were applied. CBS limit CCSD(T)
   and CASPT2 calculations with the same basis sets were also tried for
   HCN. The CCSD(T) results are noticeably less accurate than the MRCI
   results while the CASPT2 results are much poorer. The PESs were
   generated automatically using the local interpolative moving
   least-squares method (L-IMLS). A general triatomic code is described
   where the L-IMLS method is interfaced with several common electronic
   structure packages. All PESs were computed with this code running in
   parallel on eight processors. The L-IMLS method provides global and
   local fitting error measures important in automatically growing the PES
   from initial ab initio seed points. The reliability of this approach was
   tested for (CH2)-C-1 by comparing DVR-calculated vibrational levels on
   an L-IMLS ab initio surface with levels generated by an explicit ab
   initio calculation at each DVR grid point. For all levels (similar to
   200) below 20 000 cm(-1), the mean unsigned difference between the
   levels of these two calculations was 0.1 cm(-1), consistent with the
   L-IMLS estimated mean unsigned fitting error of 0.3 cm(-1). All L-IMLS
   PESs used in this work have comparable mean unsigned fitting errors,
   implying that fitting errors have a negligible role in the final errors
   of the computed vibrational levels with experiment. Less than 500 ab
   initio calculations of the energy and gradients are required to achieve
   this level of accuracy.}},

   values for the first Herman-Wallis factor A(1) and distorts the shape of
   the intensity envelope of the band. These measurements show how changes
   in the masses of the heavy atoms in the molecule have a systematic
   effect on the transition dipole and on the intensity pattern of the CN
   stretching band.}},

Abstract = {{The transition moments and vibration-rotation constants of 18 previously
   unobserved combination and/or hot bands of (HCN)-C-12-N-14 are reported.
   Overtone absorption spectra were measured with a Fourier transform
   interferometer and a multipass absorption cell with a pathlength of up
   to 352 m. The transition wavenumber measurements were used to derive
   vibration-rotation constants, and the integrated line intensities were
   used to derive an estimate of the transition moments. The new
   transitions are 01(1)3-01(1)0, 11(1)2-00(0)0, 12(0)2-000, 32(0)0-02(0)0,
