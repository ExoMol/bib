Abstract = {The HSOH, H2SO and H2OS isomers have been investigated employing the
   CCSD(T) methodology and the cc-pV(X + d)Z X = 3,4,5,6 basis sets. The
   anharmonic force fields have been calculated to predict the fundamental
   vibrational frequencies, rotational constants, vibration-rotation
   corrections, anharmonic corrections to zero-point energies, and
   structural parameters. In addition to this, a spectroscopic
   characterization of the deuterated isomers D2SO and D2OS was performed.
   At the CCSD(T)/CBS limit and including corrections for scalar
   relativistic, spin orbit and core-valence correlation effects, the
   estimated enthalpies of formation are -28.1 1, -12.3 1, and 10.1 1
   kcal/mol for HSOH, H2SO and H2OS, respectively. Finally, we discuss the
   problems faced during the extrapolation to the CBS limit of the
   properties investigated.},

Title = {Low-pressure pyrolysis of tBu2SO: synthesis and IR spectroscopic

Abstract = {Sulfenic acid (HSOH, 1) has been synthesized in the gas-phase by
   low-pressure high-temperature (1150 degrees C) pyrolysis of
   di-tert-butyl sulfoxide (tBu(2)SO, 2) and characterized by means of
   matrix isolation and gasphase IR spectroscopy. High-level
   coupled-cluster (CC) calculations (CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/ccpVQZ)
   support the first identification of the gas-phase IR spectrum of 1 and
   enable its spectral characterization. Five of the six vibrational
   fundamentals of matrix-isolated 1 have been assigned, and its rotation
   al-resolved gasphase IR spectrum provides additional information on the
   O-H and S-H stretching fundamentals. Investigations of the pyrolysis
   reaction by mass spectrometry, matrix isolation, and gasphase FT-IR
   spectroscopy reveal that, up to 500 degrees C, 2 decomposes selectively
   into tert-butylsulfenic acid, (tBuSOH, 3), and 2-methylpropene. The
   formation of the isomeric sulfoxide (tBu(H)SO, 3a) has been excluded.
   Transient 3 has been characterized by a comprehensive matrix and
   gas-phase vibrational IR study guided by the predicted vibrational
   spectrum calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level
   (B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)). At higher temperatures, the intramolecular
   decomposition of 3, monitored by matrix IR spectroscopy, yields
   short-lived I along with 2-methylpropene, but also H2O, and most
   probably sulfur atoms. In addition, HSSOH (6), H-2, and S2O are found
   among the final pyrolysis products observed at 1150 degrees C in the gas
   phase owing to competing intra- and intermolecular decomposition routes
   of 3. The decomposition routes of the starting compound 2 and of the
   primary intermediate 3 are discussed on the basis of experimental
   results and a computational study performed at the B3LYP/6-311G{*} and
   second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2/6311G{*} and RI-MP2/QZVPP) levels of
   theory.},
