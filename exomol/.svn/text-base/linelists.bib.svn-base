abstract = "Abstract Knowledge of intensities of rovibrational transitions of various molecules and theirs isotopic species in wide spectral and temperature ranges is essential for the modeling of optical properties of planetary atmospheres, brown dwarfs and for other astrophysical applications. TheoReTS (“Theoretical Reims–Tomsk Spectral data”) is an Internet accessible information system devoted to ab initio based rotationally resolved spectra predictions for some relevant molecular species. All data were generated from potential energy and dipole moment surfaces computed via high-level electronic structure calculations using variational methods for vibration–rotation energy levels and transitions. When available, empirical corrections to band centers were applied, all line intensities remaining purely ab initio. The current TheoReTS implementation contains information on four-to-six atomic molecules, including phosphine, methane, ethylene, silane, methyl-fluoride, and their isotopic species 13 \{CH\} 4 , 12 \{CH\} 3 D , 12 \{CH\} 2 D 2 , 12 \{CD\} 4 , 13 C 2 H 4 , … . Predicted hot methane line lists up to T = 2000 K are included. The information system provides the associated software for spectra simulation including absorption coefficient, absorption and emission cross-sections, transmittance and radiance. The simulations allow Lorentz, Gauss and Voight line shapes. Rectangular, triangular, Lorentzian, Gaussian, sinc and sinc squared apparatus function can be used with user-defined specifications for broadening parameters and spectral resolution. All information is organized as a relational database with the user-friendly graphical interface according to Model-View-Controller architectural tools. The full-featured web application is written on \{PHP\} using Yii framework and C++ software modules. In case of very large high-temperature line lists, a data compression is implemented for fast interactive spectra simulations of a quasi-continual absorption due to big line density. Applications for the TheoReTS may include: education/training in molecular absorption/emission, radiative and non-LTE processes, spectroscopic applications, opacity calculations for planetary and astrophysical applications. The system is freely accessible via internet on the two mirror sites: in Reims, France (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr) and in Tomsk, Russia (http://theorets.tsu.ru). "

Title = {{A full-spectrum k-distribution look-up table for radiative transfer in
   nonhomogeneous gaseous media}},
Journal = JQSRT,

Pages = {46-56},
Abstract = {{A full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) look-up table has been constructed
   for gas mixtures within a certain range of thermodynamic states for
   three species, i.e., CO2, H2O and CO. The k-distribution of a mixture is
   assembled directly from the summation of the linear absorption
   coefficients of three species. The systematic approach to generate the
   table, including the generation of the pressure-based absorption
   coefficient and the generation of the k-distribution, is discussed. To
   efficiently obtain accurate k-values for arbitrary thermodynamic states
   from tabulated values, a 6-D linear interpolation method is employed. A
   large number of radiative heat transfer calculations have been carried
   out to test the accuracy of the FSK look-up table. Results show that,
   using the FSK look-up table can provide excellent accuracy compared to
   the exact results. Without the time-consuming process of assembling
   k-distribution from individual species plus mixing, using the FSK
   look-up table can save considerable computational cost. To evaluate the
   accuracy as well as the efficiency of the FSK look-up table, radiative
   heat transfer via a scaled Sandia D Flame is calculated to compare the
   CPU execution time using the FSK method based on the narrow-band
   database, correlations, and the look-up table. Results show that the FSK
   look-up table can provide a computationally cheap alternative without
   much sacrifice in accuracy.}},

Abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are each creating
   quantitative databases containing the vapor-phase infrared spectra of
   pure chemicals. The digital databases have been created with both
   laboratory and remote-sensing applications in mind. A spectral
   resolution of approximate to0.1 cm(-1) was selected to avoid degrading
   sharp spectral features, while also realizing that atmospheric
   broadening typically limits line widths to 0.1 cm(-1). Calculated
   positional (wave-number, cm(-1)) uncertainty is less than or equal
   to0.005 cm(-1), while the 1sigma, statistical uncertainty in absorbance
   values is <2\% for most compounds. The latter was achieved by measuring
   multiple (typically 9) path length-concentration burdens and fitting a
   weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
   include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12
   samples. Though these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption
   strengths, and vapor pressures, the data agree to within experimental
   uncertainties with only one exception.},

Combust. Inst., vol. 31, 2007, pp. 2573–2580) up to about 1000 K for nine fuels commonly encountered in fire applications, namely methane, methanol, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, heptane, methyl methacrylate and toluene. These \{NB\} parameters can be used to generate a database of \{NB\} k-distributions of these fuels in order to apply the k-distribution methods to model their contributions to radiative heat transfer. The accuracy of this \{NB\} database, the \{EM2C\} \{NB\} database for methane (Perrin and Soufiani, JQSRT, vol. 103, 2007, pp. 3–13), and \{HITRAN\} 2012 for methane, methanol, ethane, and ethylene is assessed by comparison with the measured medium resolution transmissivities and spectrally-integrated radiative properties. Results show that the \{EM2C\} database is the most accurate for methane over the entire range of the temperature and the fuel partial pressure path length considered. The line parameters in \{HITRAN\} 2012 are not available for some important bands of methanol, ethane and ethylene and this spectroscopic database cannot be used with confidence above 600 K. The Malkmus narrow band database derived in the present study is found to reproduce spectrally-integrated radiative properties with error less than 20\%, which suggests that it can be used for engineering applications. Finally, applications to radiation calculations along lines of sight with methane concentrations and temperatures representative of pool fires show that both the present Malkmus narrow band and the \{NIST\} databases can predict accurately the radiative intensity for small scale pool fires where as discrepancies of the order of 30\% are expected in the case of methane pool fires with a heat release rate of 176 kW.}}

abstract = "Statistical narrow-band (SNB) model parameters for H2O, CO2, \{CH4\} and CO, and correlated-k (CK) parameters for \{H2O\} and \{CO2\} are generated from line by line calculations and recently improved spectroscopic databases in wide temperature and spectral ranges. Results from the new parameters are compared to direct line by line calculations and to results from earlier model parameters [A. Soufiani, J. Taine, High temperature gas radiative property parameters of statistical narrow-band model for H2O, \{CO2\} and \{CO\} and correlated-k (ck) model for \{H2O\} and CO2, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 40 (1997) 987–991] in terms of band averaged spectral transmissivities, Planck mean absorption coefficients, and total emissivities. The comparisons show first a good agreement between updated SNB, \{CK\} and \{LBL\} results. Significant improvements on earlier parameters are observed for \{H2O\} and CO2, especially at very high temperatures and path lengths. Model parameters and computer programs illustrating their implementation are provided as Supplementary data. "

   typically emphasize atomic species yet fingerprints from molecular
   species can occur subsequently or concurrently. In this work, selected
   molecular transitions of aluminum monixide (AlO), diatomic carbon (C-2),
   cyanide (CN), and titanium monoxide (TiO) are accurately computed. Line
   strength tables are used to describe the radiative transitions of
   diatomic molecules primarily in the visible, optical region. Details are
   elaborated of the computational procedure that allows one to utilize
   diatomic spectra as a predictive and as a diagnostic tool. In order to
   create a computed spectrum, the procedure requires information regarding
   the temperature of the diatomic transitions along with other input such
   as the spectral resolution. When combined with a fitting algorithm to
   optimize such parameters, this procedure is used to infer information
   from an experimentally obtained spectrum. Furthermore, the programs and
   data files are provided for LIBS investigations that also reveal MO,
   C-2, CN, and TiO diatomic spectra.}},

  abstract = {The discovery of extrasolar planets is one of the major scientific
	advances of the last two decades. Hundreds of planets have now been
	detected and astronomers are beginning to characterize their composition
	and physical characteristics. To do this requires a huge quantity
	of spectroscopic data most of which are not available from laboratory
	studies. The ExoMol project will offer a comprehensive solution to
	this problem by providing spectroscopic data on all the molecular
	transitions of importance in the atmospheres of exoplanets. These
	data will be widely applicable to other problems and will be used
	for studies on cool stars, brown dwarfs and circumstellar environments.
	This paper lays out the scientific foundations of this project and
	reviews previous work in this area. A mixture of first principles
	and empirically tuned quantum mechanical methods will be used to
	compute comprehensive and very large rotationvibration and rotationvibrationelectronic
	line lists. Methodologies will be developed for treating larger molecules
	such as methane and nitric acid. ExoMol will rely on these developments
	and the use of state-of-the-art computing.},

Title = {{A major upgrade of the VALD database}},
Journal = {Physica Scripta},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Abstract = {{Vienna atomic line database (VALD) is a collection of critically
   evaluated laboratory parameters for individual atomic transitions,
   complemented by theoretical calculations. VALD is actively used by
   astronomers for stellar spectroscopic studies-model atmosphere
   calculations, atmospheric parameter determinations, abundance analysis
   etc. The two first VALD releases contained parameters for atomic
   transitions only. In a major upgrade of VALD-VALD3, publically available
   from spring 2014, atomic data was complemented with parameters of
   molecular lines. The diatomic molecules C-2, CH, CN, CO, OH, MgH, SiH,
   TiO are now included. For each transition VALD provides species name,
   wavelength, energy, quantum number J and Lande-factor of the lower and
   upper levels, radiative, Stark and van der Waals damping factors and a
   full description of electronic configurarion and term information of
   both levels. Compared to the previous versions we have revised and
   verify all of the existing data and added new measurements and
   calculations for transitions in the range between 20 angstrom and 200
   microns. All transitions were complemented with term designations in a
   consistent way and electron configurations when available. All data were
   checked for consistency: listed wavelength versus Ritz, selection rules
   etc. A new bibliographic system keeps track of literature references for
   each parameter in a given transition throughout the merging process so
   that every selected data entry can be traced to the original source. The
   query language and the extraction tools can now handle various units,
   vacuum and air wavelengths. In the upgrade process we had an intensive
   interaction with data producers, which was very helpful for improving
   the quality of the VALD content.}},
