   `Morse/long-range' (or MLR) potential energy function is a very
   flexible form which explicitly incorporates the theoretically predicted
   inverse-power-sum long-range tail, is smooth and differentiable
   everywhere, and includes the well depth D-e, equilibrium distance r(e),
   and long-range interaction coefficients C-m as explicit parameters.
   This form is being used increasingly commonly in direct-potential-fit
   analyses of experimental data. The present work shows that the MLR form
   can readily accommodate the inclusion of `damping functions' in the
   description of the long-range potential tail, and that inclusion of
   such terms leads to much more realistic short-range extrapolation
   behaviour. Illustrative applications to the ground electronic states of
   MgH, Li-2 and ArXe are presented.},

   including the first measurements of Mg isotope ratios in stars with
   metallicities below {[}Fe/H] = -2.0. We confirm the decrease in
   Mg-25/Mg-24 and Mg-26/Mg-24 with decreasing {[}Fe/H], as predicted by
   recent models of Galactic chemical evolution in which the Mg isotopes
   are produced in massive stars. A subset of kinematically identified
   thin-disk stars have Mg isotope ratios in excellent agreement with the
   predictions. Within the measurement uncertainties, these thin-disk
   stars show no scatter about the predictions. Several of our stars are
   likely members of the thick disk, and their high Mg isotopic ratios may
   reflect the nucleosynthetic history of the thick disk, which is
   distinct from the predictions for, and observations of, the thin disk.
   For thick-disk and halo stars we find a scatter in (25)g/Mg-24 and
   Mg-26/Mg-24 exceeding our measurement uncertainties and increasing with
   increasing metallicity. Our data suggest that an additional source of
   Mg-25 and Mg-26 is required. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch
   stars are likely candidates.},

Abstract = {The two potential energy surfaces (PESs) associated to the (1)A' and
   (3)A' states correlating to the interacting MgH(X(2)Sigma(+)) + H((2)S)
   system were determined from ab initio calculations. They were obtained
   using the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set for the H atom and the cc-pV5Z basis set
   for the Mg atom and multireference internally contracted
   configuration-interaction (MRCI) method including Davidson correction.
   The MgH distance was kept fixed at its experimental equilibrium distance
   in the X(2)Sigma ground state. The ab initio calculated interaction
   energies of the two PESs were. fitted analytically on the basis of
   Legendre polynomials for future collisional rotational excitation study.
   The (1)A' and (3)A' adiabats both present very deep well corresponding
   to the MgH(2) complex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The electronic structure of the MgH molecule is investigated using a
   pseudopotential description of the Mg(2+) core, complemented by a core
   polarization operator. The electronic problem is treated by the
   Internally Contracted Multi-Reference Configuration Interaction method
   (IC-MRCI). The potential energy curves and the molecular constants are
   calculated for all MgH molecular states dissociating up to the excited
   atomic configurations Mg(3s3d(1)D) + H(1s(2)S). A good agreement with
   the available experimental data is found. These calculations help to
   clarify the very complicated spectroscopy of MgH in the 3500046000
   cm(-1) excitation range, where many states correlated with the 3s3p,
   3s4s and 3s3d atomic configurations cross one another. For instance, the
   predissociation mechanism of the B(2)Sigma(1) state is enlighten. Both
   the doublet and quartet systems are documented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {New high-resolution visible emission spectra of the MgH molecule have
   been recorded with high signal-to-noise ratios using a Fourier transform
   spectrometer. Many bands of the A (II)-I-2 -> X (2)Sigma(+) and B'
   (2)Sigma(+) -> X (2)Sigma(+) electronic transitions of (MgH)-Mg-24 were
   analyzed; the new data span the v' = 0-3 levels of the A (II)-I-2 and
   B'(2)Sigma(+) excited states and the v `' = 0-11 levels of the X
   (2)Sigma(+) ground electronic state. The vibration-rotation energy
   levels of the perturbed A (II)-I-2 and B' (2)Sigma(+) states were fitted
   as individual term values, while those of the X (2)Sigma(+) ground state
   were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic
   potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct
   attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that
   includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a
   significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of
   MgH was obtained. The v `' = 11 level of the X (2)Sigma(+) ground
   electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of
   24 MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The
   equilibrium dissociation energy for the X (2)Sigma(+) ground state of
   (MgH)-Mg-24 has been determined to, be D-e = 11104.7 +/- 0.5 cm(-1)
   (1.37681 +/- 0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v `' = 0) is
   739.11 +/- 0.01 cm(-1). The zero-point dissociation energy is therefore
   D-0 = 10365.6 +/- 0.5 cm(-1) (1.28517 +/- 0.00006 eV). The uncertainty
   in the new experimental dissociation energy of MgH is more than 2 orders
   of magnitude smaller than that for the best value available in the
   literature. MgH is now the only hydride molecule other than H-2 itself
   for which all bound vibrational levels of the ground electronic state
   are observed experimentally and for which the dissociation energy is
   determined with subwavenumber accuracy.},

Title = {Collisional influence on the differential Hanle effect method applied to

Journal = AA,

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aims. This paper presents an analysis of the Q(1,2)( 6-12) lines of the
   Q band of the A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) ( 0, 0) transition of MgH, whose
   linear polarization was measured 4 arcsec inside the solar limb in a
   quiet region ( North Pole) with THEMIS on 21 November 2004.
   Methods. This analysis is performed as follows: a) the Hanle effect
   Gamma(H) parameter is derived by applying the differential Hanle effect
   method between the two extreme pairs of lines. Assuming no depolarizing
   collisions, a magnetic field strength follows, which is found to be 9.2
   Gauss, in agreement with previous observations of the same kind; b) this
   GH parameter is entered in a code solving the NLTE polarized radiative
   transfer equations, and the other depolarizing parameter, namely the
   depolarizing collision rate, is then derived by adjusting the computed
   polarization to the observed one. Thus an average value of the rate per
   colliding hydrogen atom a( 2) = 1.20 x 10(-9) cm(3) s(-1) is obtained
   for the upper levels of the 12 lines ( standard deviation 0.21 x 10(-9)
   cm(3) s(-1)). The corresponding model-dependent depolarizing rate is D(
   2) = ( 4.2 +/- 0.7) x 10(7) s(-1) at h = 200 km; c) this depolarizing
   rate is now introduced in the conversion of the GH parameter in terms of
   magnetic field strength: an average turbulent field strength of 29 +/-
   12 Gauss is derived as the final value, at height h = 200 +/- 80 km
   where the polarization is formed. The Honl-London factors of the lines
   under interest have been recalculated, leading to detect an error of a
   factor 2 in the recent literature.
   Results. The derived value B = 29 +/- 12 Gauss at h = 200 +/- 80 km is
   in fairly good agreement with the previous determinations based on the
   interpretation of the Sr I 4607 angstrom limb polarization, which has
   led to fields in the range 35-60 Gauss.
   Conclusions. Given the error bars, it seems unnecessary to put forward
   different formation regions for the Sr I and MgH lines.},

Abstract = {The analysis of the Hanle effect in solar molecular lines allows us to
   obtain empirical information on hidden, mixed-polarity magnetic fields
   at subresolution scales in the (granular) upflowing regions of the
   ``quiet{''} solar photosphere. Here we report that collisions seem to be
   very efficient in depolarizing the rotational levels of MgH lines. This
   has the interesting consequence that in the upflowing regions of the
   quiet solar photosphere the strength of the hidden magnetic field cannot
   be much larger than 10 G, assuming the simplest case of a single-valued
   microturbulent field that fills the entire upflowing photospheric
   volume. Alternatively, an equally good theoretical fit to the observed
   scattering polarization amplitudes can be achieved by assuming that the
   rate of depolarizing collisions is an order of magnitude smaller than in
   the previous collisionally dominated case, but then the required
   strength of the hidden field in the upflowing regions turns out to be
   unrealistically high. These constraints reinforce our previously
   obtained conclusion that there is a vast amount of hidden magnetic
   energy and unsigned magnetic flux localized in the (intergranular)
   downflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere.},

   density functional theory methods are used for the hfcc's, and
   multireference configuration interaction wavefunctions for DeltaE's,
   f-values and g-shifts. In XZ(+) (X = B to Ga; Z = Li to K), the 2sigma
   unpaired electron is 60-90\% p(sigma)(X), resulting in
   \textbackslash{}A(perpendicular to)\textbackslash{} being one order of
   magnitude larger than \textbackslash{}Ak(parallel to)\textbackslash{}.
   The Deltag(perpendicular to)'s are relatively large for just 3 valence
   electrons, from -3300 to -6100 ppm for BZ(+), -14 100 to -29 600 ppm for
   AlZ(+), and -93 700 to -198 300 ppm for GaZ(+). Such large
   Deltag(perpendicular to)(XZ(+))'s relate to the strong coupling between
   the close-lying X(2)Sigma(+) and I(2)Pi(2sigma --> 1pi) states, which
   results from the splitting of the P-2(s(2)p) state of X due to its
   interaction with Z(+). ESR spectra are not available for any of the
   XZ(+)'s. Calculation on the hydrides YH/XH+ reproduce well the

   strongly perturbed in Ar matrices. Several transitions X(2)Sigma(+) -->
   n(2)Sigma(+) and X(2)Sigma(+) --> n(2)Pi in XZ(+) have large oscillator

Abstract = {In the reaction of Mg(3s3p(1)P(1)) with H-2, we have constructed a new
   version of ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) for 2A' and 1A'
   states and their corresponding fit energy functions, on which 50 000
   trajectory calculations are performed. The improvement of the current
   quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations has made dynamical
   parameters more reliable than those reported previously. For instance,
   the obtained bimodal rotational distribution of MgH (v = 0), with a peak
   ratio of ca. 2:1 for the high-N to low-N components, is consistent with
   the experimental findings. The evaluated vibrational population ratio of
   ca. 0.52 for v = 1 to v = 0 is also within the range of observation, 0.7
   +/- 0.2. In addition, this work provides new information about the
   formation of MgH rotational levels via the angular momentum analysis.
   The trajectory calculations reveals the relation of the rotational
   distribution to the impact parameter, b, and the relative angle,
   epsilon, between the orbital and rotational angular momenta of the
   products. The MgH is preferentially populated in the high-Ar levels at
   small b but favors the low-N distribution at acute-angle (<90<degrees>)
   epsilon. The analysis of vector correlation provides insight into the
   behavior of the MgH rotational population.},

Abstract = {Quasi-classical trajectory calculations for the reaction of
   Mg(3s3p(1)P(1)) with H-2 are performed on two potential energy surfaces
   (PES), the excited state (1)A' (or B-1(2) in the C-2v symmetry) in the
   entrance channel and the ground state (1)A' (or (1)A(1)) in the exit
   channel. A many-body expansion procedure is adopted for the construction
   of the analytical fit functions from the ab initio results. The title
   reaction involves a nonadiabatic transition between the two potential
   surfaces. For simplicity, the transition probability is assumed to be
   unity when the trajectory goes through the region of surface crossing
   and changes to the lower surface. The calculated total collisional
   deactivation and reaction cross sections decrease with the increase of
   translational collision energy. The calculated rotational product
   distributions are characterized by a bimodal feature both fur the MgH v
   = 0 and 1 states. The trend of bimodality is consistent with the
   observation reported in experimental studies. Our inspection of
   individual trajectories reveals that the low-rotational and
   high-rotational populations are caused by two distinct reaction
   pathways. This observation supports our previous expectation for the
   microscopic branching via the PES anisotropy. The angular product
   distribution indicates that the reaction proceeds predominantly via a
   linear collision complex. An increase of the collision energy from 2.026
   to 8.104 kcal/mol has resulted in a shift of the distribution toward
   forward direction. The vibrational product distribution tends to
   decrease with the quantum numbers. The ratio of MgH(v = 1) to MgH(v = 0)
   yields a value of similar to 0.3, which is nevertheless underestimated
   as compared with the observation of 0.7 +/- 0.2. The reasons for the
   discrepancy are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Surface gravities are deduced for Arcturus and five other cool giant
   stars. A temperature and an overall abundance are adopted for each
   object and the surface gravity is then found by requiring the magnesium
   abundance derived from Mg I features to match that derived from MgH. The
   contamination of the MgH features by lines of the C2 system is allowed
   for. The values obtained by this method are compared with those found by
   other spectroscopic methods that use Fe ionization equilibria and the
   pro files of strong lines. The errors inherent in the molecular
   equilibrium methods are discussed. The surface gravities found from
   radii derived from parallaxes and angular diameters, and an assumed mass
   of 1 M., are compared with the spectroscopic results. The results for
   Arcturus are also compared with those found from the molecular
   equilibrium method applied to oxygen features. All the determinations
   discussed here use a consistent set of theoretical, LTE, flux-constant,
   line-blanketed model atmospheres, and the differences in the results are
   taken to be evidence for non-LTE effects. It is suggested that these
   comparisons indicate a range of spectral types for which non-LTE effects
   are important.
   A supplemental abundance analysis for one of the giant stars (phi2Ori)
   is also presented.},

Abstract = {The pure rotational spectrum of the MgH radical (X 2SIGMA+) in its
   ground state v = 0 and v = 1 vibrational modes has been observed in the
   laboratory using millimeter/submillimeter direct absorption
   spectroscopy. The rotational spectra of two isotopically substituted
   species, MgD and (MgH)-Mg-26, have been detected as well. These free
   radicals were produced by the reaction of magnesium, vaporized in a
   Broida-type oven, with hydrogen atoms generated in a microwave
   discharge. All six hyperfine components of the N = 0 --> 1 transition of
   MgH in its v = 0 and v = 1 states have been directly measured to an
   accuracy of + 50 kHz, and five components have been observed for
   (MgH)-Mg-26. The N = 0 --> 1 and N = 1 --> 2 transitions of MgD have
   also been detected. Rotational, fine structure, and hyperfine constants
   were determined for all species from a nonlinear least-squares fit to
   the data using a 2SIGMA Hamiltonian. Measurement of these frequencies
   for MgH should greatly aid in establishing its presence in interstellar
   space.},

Abstract = {The possibility of using MgH lines as a gravity criterion for red giant
   atmospheres is considered. High-resolution spectra of twelve K0-K3
   giants were obtained with the CCD camera in the coude spectrograph of
   the Shajn telescope. The effective temperatures T(ef) of these giants
   have been determined from (Y-K) colors, and the gravities 1g g have been
   obtained from the comparison of observed and calculated equivalent
   widths if MgH features with the wavelengths 5134,6; 5138,7, 5140,2
   angstrom angstrom. The results of the investigation of the influence of
   some parameters (micro- and macroturbulence, metallicity, abundance of
   Mg etc.) on the calculated MgH line profiles are discussed. The values
   of T(ef) and Ig g are compared with those obtained by other methods and
   published ones. The calibration diagrams for the determination of
   gravities of red giants with T(ef) from 4000 K to 5000 K from the
   equivalent widths and the central intensities of MgH lines are proposed.},

Abstract = {Two accompanying papers have used synthetic spectra to discuss the
   calibration of CO band indices and the C(41-42), C(42-45) and C(45-48),
   C(42-45) diagrams of the DDO photometric system.  The band passes of the
   latter system are strongly influenced by lines of CN, CH, MgH, and SiH,
   with the SiH lines affecting the 41 pass band in dwarfs.  Simple
   formulas which make predictions of the strengths of these lines are
   discussed.  The results of these formulas are compared with approximate
   calculations of the ratio of line to continuous absorption coefficients
   in the stellar atmospheres.  Some discussion of the depth dependence of
   the different molecular abundances is also given.  The luminosity
   dependence of the CO bands is shown to be a consequence of the lower
   continuous absorption coefficient in giant star atmospheres as compared
   to dwarfs.  The lesser depletion of carbon by CO formation and lower
   continuous opacity in giants with T(eff) < 4500 K leads to them having
   stronger CN and CH bands than the corresponding dwarfs.  The need to
   include an enhanced nitrogen abundance to explain the observed CN band
   strengths in the hotter giants can be understood.  The relative
   importance of CH as a continuous opacity source is considered.  The SiH
   lines are shown to vary strongly with T(eff) and log g, in a manner
   similar to that of the MgH lines.},

Abstract = {Isotopic abundance ratios (24)Mg:(25)Mg:(26)Mg are derived for 20 stars
   from high-resolution spectra of the MgH A-X 0-0 band at 5140 Angstrom.
   With the exception of the weak G-band giant HR 1299, the stars are
   dwarfs that sample the metallicity range - 1.8 < {[}Fe/H] < 0.0. The
   abundance of (25)Mg and (26)Mg relative to the dominant isotope (24)Mg
   decreases with decreasing {[}Fe/H] in fair accord with predictions from
   a recent model of Galactic chemical evolution in which the Mg isotopes
   are synthesized by massive stars. Several stars appear especially
   enriched in the heavier Mg isotopes, suggesting contamination by
   material from the envelopes of intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch
   stars.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2001},
Volume = {556},
Number = {1, Part 1},
Pages = {357-372},
Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {We present opacity sampling model atmospheres, synthetic spectra, and
   colors for brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the following two
   limiting cases of dust grain formation: (1) Inefficient gravitational
   settling (i.e., the dust is distributed according to the chemical
   equilibrium predictions) and (2) efficient gravitational settling (i.e.,
   the dust forms and depletes refractory elements from the gas, but their
   opacity does not affect the thermal structure). The models include the
   formation of over 600 gas-phase species and 1000 liquids and crystals
   and the opacities of 30 different types of grains including corundum the
   magnesium aluminum spinel MgAl2O4, iron, enstatite (MgSiO3), forsterite
   (Mg2SiO4), amorphous carbon, SiC, and a number of calcium silicates. The
   models extend from the beginning of the grain formation regime well into
   the condensation regime of water ice (T-eff = 3000-100 K) and encompass
   the range of log g = 2.5-6.0 at solar metallicity. We find that silicate
   dust grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of red
   and brown dwarfs with a spectral type later than M8. The greenhouse
   effects of dust opacities provide a natural explanation for the
   peculiarly red spectroscopic distribution of the latest M dwarfs and
   young brown dwarfs. The grainless (cond) models, on the other hand,
   correspond closely to methane brown dwarfs such as Gliese 229B. We also
   discover that the lambda lambda 5891, 5897 Na I D and lambda lambda
   7687, 7701 K I resonance doublets play a critical role in T dwarfs, in
   which their red wings define the pseudocontinuum from the I to the Z
   bandpass.},
