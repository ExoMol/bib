   Mg and O production},

Abstract = {We used multiconfigurational methods and a large basis set to compute
   the potential energy curves of the valence and valence-Rydberg
   electronic states of MgO molecule. New bound electronic states are
   found. Using these highly correlated wave functions, we evaluated their
   mutual spin-orbit couplings and transition moment integrals. For the
   bound electronic states of MgO, we deduced an accurate set of
   spectroscopic constants that agree remarkably well with experimental
   results. Moreover, our potentials, transition moments, and spin-orbit
   coupling evolutions are incorporated into Fermi golden rule calculations
   to deduce the radiative lifetimes of MgO(B (1)Sigma(+)) rovibrational
   levels and the natural lifetimes of MgO(A (1)Pi) vibrational levels,
   where a good agreement is found with experimental values. Finally, we
   suggest new routes for the production of cold Mg and O atoms and cold
   MgO molecules. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {Geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and bond
   dissociation energies are predicted for the simple alkaline earth (Be,
   Mg and Ca) fluorides, chlorides, oxides, and hydroxides at the coupled
   cluster theory {[}CCSD(T)] level including core-valence correlation with
   the aug-cc-pwCVnZ basis sets up to n = 5 in some cases. Additional
   corrections (scalar relativistic effects, vibrational zero-point
   energies, and atomic spin-orbit effects) were necessary to accurately
   calculate the total atomization energies and heats of formation. The
   calculated geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and
   bond dissociation energies are compared with the available experimental
   data. For a number of these alkaline earth compounds, the experimental
   geometries and energies are not reliable. MgF(2) and BeF(2) are
   predicted to be linear and CaF(2) is predicted to be bent. BeOH is
   predicted to be bent, whereas MgOH and CaOH are linear. The OBeO angle
   in Be(OH)(2) is not linear, and the molecule has C(2), symmetry. The
   heat of formation at 298 K for MgO is calculated to be 32.3 kcal/mol,
   and the bond dissociation energy at 0 K is predicted to be 61.5
   kcal/mol.},

Abstract = {From observations of the metallic species sodium (Na), potassium (K).

   distribution and/or line width characteristic of high to extreme
   temperature - tens of thousands of degrees K The temperatures of
   refractory species, Including magnesium and calcium, indicate that the
   source process for the atoms observed in the tail and near-planet
   exosphere are consistent with ion sputtering and/or impact vaporization
   of a molecule with subsequent dissociation into the atomic form The
   extended Mg tall is consistent with a surface abundance of 5-8\% Mg by
   number. if 30\% of impact-vaporized Mg remains as MgO and half of the
   impact vapor condenses Globally, ion sputtering is not a major source of
   Mg, but locally the sputtered source can be larger than the impact vapor
   source We conclude that the Na and K in Mercury's exosphere can be
   derived from a regolith composition similar to that of Luna 16 soil (or

Abstract = {Pure rotational transitions of MgO in the a(3)Pi(i) state and the ground
   X-1 Sigma(+) state (v = 1-3) were observed in the 210-400 GHz region.
   The MgO molecule was produced by a DC discharge in a mixture of Mg vapor
   and N2O. A simultaneous deperturbation analysis for the X-1 Sigma(+),
   a(3)Pi, and A(1)Pi states was carried out for the observed transition
   frequencies including previous high-resolution data, where the energy
   levels were calculated by diagonalizing the energy matrix including the
   spin-orbit and orbit-rotation interactions among three electronic states
   with vibrational levels up to v = 9. A centrifugal term of the
   spin-orbit interaction between the a(3)Pi(i) and X-1 Sigma(+) states was
   newly introduced to improve quality of the fitting, to explain the
   observed A-type doubling of the a(3)Pi(i) state. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra of MgO- and ZnO- have been
   recorded at several photon energies under varied experimental
   conditions. Peaks in these highly structured spectra have been assigned
   to photodetachment transitions from the MgO- and ZnO- ground state (X
   (2)Sigma (+)) to vibrational progressions in the ground and several low
   lying neutral excited states. In addition, a high-temperature MgO-
   spectrum shows spectral features due to photodetachment from an excited
   electronic state of the MgO- anion, which has been assigned to an
   A(2)Pi: anionic state. From the MgO- spectra, the electron affinity of
   the MgO ground state (X (1)Sigma (+)) is determined to be 1.630 (0.025)
   eV. Four electronic excited states of MgO, a(3)Pi, A(1)Pi, b(3)Sigma
   (+), and B(1)Sigma (+), were found to lie 2510, 3390, 8390; and 20 000
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) neutral ground state, respectively. The
   excited MgO- A(2)Pi anion state was found to lie 4791 cm(-1) above the
   MgO- X (2)Sigma (+) anion ground state. The photoelectron spectra of
   ZnO-, presented here at higher photon energies, extend a previous
   photoelectron study by Fancher et al, to the first two excited neutral
   states, a(3)Pi and A(1)Pi, which have been found to lie 2460 and 4960
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) ground state, respectively. From
   Franck-Condon analyses of the well-resolved vibrational progressions for
   each electronic transition, equilibrium internuclear distances and
   fundamental vibrational frequencies of the MgO and ZnO neutral
   electronic states were determined. Moreover, because the sources
   employed produced vibrationally hot anions, the bond length and
   vibrational frequencies of both the MgO- ground and excited states were
   found from the vibrational hot band transitions.},

Abstract = {Extended measurements are reported for rovibronic transitions between
   the strongly mixed low-lying X(1) Sigma(+), a(3) Pi and A(1) Pi
   electronic states of the MgO molecule in the 1640-3510 cm(-1) region.
   The measurements were made with the Faraday laser magnetic resonance
   (LMR) technique utilizing a CO laser and a CO overtone laser. The new
   observed lines include the A(1) Pi-X(1) Sigma(+) (0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-2,
   1-3, 2-2, 2-4, 3-3) bands as well as the much weaker a(3) Pi(0,1)-X(1)
   Sigma(+) (0-0, 1-0) intercombination bands. The present highly precise
   LMR data provide a basis for performing an extensive deperturbation
   analysis including the spin-orbit, orbit-rotation and Zeeman
   interactions between the rovibronic levels of the X(1) Sigma(+) a(3) Pi
   and a(1) Pi states. Thereby the present data are combined with reliable
   earlier experimental results, in particular for the transitions
   involving higher lying vibronic states, in order to obtain the effective
   deperturbed molecular constants and perturbation parameters for the
   three lowest lying electronic states of MgO to as high an accuracy as
   possible. The absolute standard deviation of the LMR data is 6 x 10(-4)
   cm(-1) (18 MHz), which is in accord with the accuracy of our
   measurements. The set of deperturbed molecular parameters reproduces all

Abstract = {The gas-phase infrared absorption spectrum of the A1PI-X1SIGMA+ system
   of MgO was observed in the 2700-5400 cm-1 region with a high-resolution
   Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.  The MgO molecule was produced
   in a reaction of Mg vapor with N2O.  The observed 501 spectral lines
   were assigned to five vibrational bands, upsilon(A)-upsilon(X) = 1-0m
   2-0, 3-0, 2-1, and 0-1 of 24MgO.  These lines were analyzed to determine
   the band origins, the rotational, centrifugal distortion, and
   LAMBDA-type doubling constants in the A1PI state.  The term value T(e)
   of the A1PI state was derived to be 3563.8377 (74) cm-1, with one
   standard deviation in parentheses.  The rotational levels in the A1PI
   state were found to be perturbed by those of the vibrational levels of
   the X1SIGMA+ state through rotational-electronic interaction, and the
   analysis of the perturbation was carried out to determine the
   interaction constants.  The spectra of the upsilon(A)-upsilon(X) = 1-0
   bands of the isotopic species, 25MgO and 26MgO, wer also observed and
   analyzed.  (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

   strongly mixed low lying X1SIGMA+, a3PI and A1PI electronic states of
   (MgO)-Mg-24-O-16. The A1PI-X1SIGMA+ (0-2) band and the a3PI0.1-X1SIGMA+

   performed with the CO laser Faraday laser magnetic resonance (LMR)
   technique in combination with a special oven set-up for the MgO
   production. The LMR data were fitted together with already published
   data to an effective Hamiltonian where the spin-orbit, orbit-rotation
   and Zeeman interactions between these three electronic states are
   included directly. We determined the interaction parameters and obtained
   a set of effective deperturbed molecular parameters of MgO in the
   X1SIGMA+ (v = 0, 1, 2), a3PI (v = 0) and A1PI (v = 0) states. These
   parameters describe the LMR data within 7 x 10(-4) cm-1 (21 MHz) on

Abstract = {The character of low-lying excited states of MgO has been examined using
   cluster models of the MgO crystal. Several different clusters were used;
   in general, the clusters contained a central Mg atom, one or more shells
   of nearest-neighbor Mg and O atoms, and a large number of point charges
   to represent the Madelung potential in the space of the atoms explicitly
   included in the cluster. The excited orbital was occupied in two ways.
   First, an electron was added to a low lying excited level while the Mg2+
   and O2- anion levels were kept fully occupied. In the second way, an
   electron was excited from the oxygen 2p band into a low lying excited
   level. The excited orbitals, for both of these cases are very similar.
   Although the energetics of the excited states depended on the cluster
   model, in particular whether it was Mg or O terminated, the general
   character of the excited orbital remained the same. In all clusters, the
   excited state orbital was diffuse and delocalized. The excited orbital
   has no simple or direct relationship to the 3s orbital of Mg2+. It is
   best described as a `'conduction band'' orbital. It extends up to and
   beyond the edge of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster. In our
   work, we did not find any evidence for localized excitonic states.},

Abstract = {Using a 6-311G{*}{*} basis set with estimation of correlation energy at

   Enthalpy changes at 298.15 K were obtained for isogyric reactions and
   standard enthalpies of formation were derived from these. Comparison of
   the standard enthalpies of formation with the sparse literature data
   suggests the MP2/6-311G{*}{*} standard enthalpies of formation are
   accurate to +/-15 kJ mol-1 and the corresponding G2 enthalpies accurate
   to +/-10 kJ mol-1. The calculated DELTAH(f)0 {[}MgN, g] revealed a gross
   error in the currently accepted value for this function. It is intended
   that these results will be used to parameterize the semiempirical

   Sanchez de Meras, and Nebot Gil to select a CASSCF active space for MgO
   is flawed by local minima in the optimization. We show that their
   correlation treatment underestimates D(e) by 0.2 eV. In addition, the
   small basis set employed resulted in at least another 0.6 eV
   underestimation of the D(e). Thus their computed D(e) value is in error
   by at least 0.8 eV. Our calculations demonstrate that D(e) (to Mg 1S and
   O 3P) is larger than 2.70 eV and strongly support our previous estimate
   of 2.80 +/- 0.1 eV. Hence, this value is not in error by 1 eV as

Abstract = {This paper describes an expanded mechanism of metal combustion that
   emphasizes reactions and phase changes occurring within the burning
   metal in addition to those occurring on and above the metal surface.
   Selected recent experimental work showing the importance of these
   internal processes in metal combustion is surveyed. Gas dissolution
   within the burning metal, ensuing phase changes, and their effects on
   combustion are discussed, Metal-gas phase diagrams are used to interpret
   the experimentally observed metal combustion behavior. Some concepts
   aimed at designing improved metal-based high energy density materials
   and controlling metals flammability are briefly addressed. (C) 2000
