Abstract = {The low-lying electronic states of NiH and NiAt are investigated by
   using multireference second-order perturbation theory with relativistic
   effects taken into account. The potential energy curves as well as the
   corresponding spectroscopic constants are reported. The results are
   grossly in good agreement with the available experimental data and
   should thus be very useful for guiding future experimental measurements.
   A cross comparison with other nickel monohalides NiX (X = F, Cl, Br, and
   I) reveals that the change in the spin-orbit splittings when going from
   lighter to heavier ligands results more from the state interaction than
   from the relativistic effects of the ligands.},

Abstract = {The high resolution magnetic rotation spectrum of a diatomic molecule is
   considered. A procedure is described for calculation of the magnetic
   rotation signal in both first and second harmonic for an oscillating
   magnetic field in the low-field limit. The procedure is simpler than
   other methods available in the literature, and a more complete account
   is taken of the various possible contributions to the signal.
   Perturbations between electronic states that make it possible to observe
   magnetic rotation signals for high-J transitions are discussed, along
   with the associated evolution of line shape that complicates frequency
   measurements from magnetic rotation spectra. Examples are given from a
   recent magnetic rotation study of the A (3)Pi (1u)-X (1)Sigma (+)(g)
   system of Br-79(2). (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {It is typically assumed that once a Hartree-Fock (HF) reference wave
   function is determined, the correlated wave function obtained from that
   HF wave function describes the same electronic state. In this paper, we
   report the appearance of multiple CCSD solutions obtained from the UHF
   reference wave function for the known ground state of a chemically
   interesting molecule, NiH. To determine a correspondence between the
   computed CCSD solutions and the physical electronic states, we consider
   several characteristics of the CCSD wave functions, e.g., potential
   energy curves, spin density isovalue plots, and excited state studies
   via EOM-CCSD calculations. Finally, the use of Brueckner orbitals is
   encouraged as a way to avoid some of the problems highlighted here for
   HF-based coupled cluster calculations in such challenging systems.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {129},

Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {We investigate gas-phase neutral and cationic hydrides formed by 3d
   transition metals from Sc to Cu with density functional theory (DFT)
   methods. The performance of two exchange-correlation functionals,
   Boese-Martin for kinetics (BMK) and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
   (TPSS), in predicting bond lengths and energetics, electronic
   structures, dipole moments, and ionization potentials is evaluated in
   comparison with available experimental data. To ensure a unique
   self-consistent field (SCF) solution, we use stability analysis, Fermi
   smearing, and continuity analysis of the potential energy curves.
   Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively
   correct description of the bond dissociation. We found that on average
   BMK predicted values of dissociation energies and ionization potentials
   are closer to experiment than those obtained with high level wave
   function theory methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the
   fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased.
   Natural bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the
   details of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference
   character in the wave function description of the hydrides is reproduced
   in broken-symmetry DFT description, as evidenced by NBO analysis. We
   also propose a new scheme to correct for spin contamination arising in
   broken-symmetry DFT approach. Unlike conventional schemes, our spin
   correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
   individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
   values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure
   singlet state from the energy of the broken-symmetry DFT description of
   the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
   and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized
   electron pairs). The high spin states are build with canonical natural
   orbitals and do not require SCF convergence.},

Abstract = {A global deperturbation is presented for all electronic states of NiH
   with T0 values below 0.3 eV. These states form an isolated group and are
   treated as components of a molecular ``supermultiplet{''} which is
   derived from a nickel-centered 3d9 electron configuration such as that
   found in the 2D term of Ni+. Observed term energies for all low-lying
   states, including some vibrationally excited levels, are used in a least
   squares fit to the supermultiplet model. A crucial feature of the
   supermultiplet model is its employment, wherever possible, of atomic
   angular (e.g., L +/- \textbackslash{}L-LAMBDA> = {[}L (L + 1 ) - LAMBDA
   (LAMBDA +/- 1)]1/2\textbackslash{}L-LAMBDA +/- 1>) and radial (e.g.,
   spin-orbit coupling constants) matrix elements to define and constrain
   the molecular effective Hamiltonian. A relatively small number of
   adjustable parameters are required to represent the upsilon = 0 and 1, J
   = 0.5-11.5 term values in the supermultiplet picture and accurately
   describe a variety of observations, which include large OMEGA-doublings,
   unusually large and J, OMEGA, e/f-dependent Zeeman g values, and a
   symmetry-forbidden (DELTA-LAMBDA = 2) rotational pertubation. The number
   of independently adjustable parameters required by the supermultiplet
   model is significantly smaller than a standard 2-DELTA, 2-PI, 2-SIGMA+
   deperturbation model. In addition, the fitted deperturbed (i.e.,
   nonrelativistic and nonrotating) molecular constants for the 2-DELTA,
   2-PI, 2-SIGMA+ components of the NiH supermultiplet are in better
   agreement with theoretical descriptions than previous empirical
   constants taken directly, without deperturbation, from spectra. The fit
   model also yields an empirical value of the (3d9) sigma approximately
   3d10 configuration mixing coefficient, which is relevant to a global
   understanding of the d9 and d10 states in the homologous NiH, PdH, PtH
   series of molecules.},

Abstract = {The rotational spectrum of NiD in the lowest three vibrational levels (v

   five isotopes of nickel and within both the lower  2DELTA5/2 and upper
   2DELTA3/2 spin components. The nuclear hyperfine splittings for the
   Ni-61 isotope (I = 3/2) have been resolved. An effective Hamiltonian has
   been used to fit the data which include the known vibration-rotational
   transitions within the 2DELTA5/2(v = 1 <-- v = 0) subsystem and a fine
   structure transition in the v = 0 level of the 2DELTA ground state,
   recently measured by CO2 LMR. From a parity splitting of the rotational

   been observed in neon, argon, and krypton matrices. Bands in the
   600-2000 cm(-1) region were assigned as frequencies of the NiH2 (NiD2,
   NiHD) molecule. Contrary to earlier ab initio calculations, this
   assignment implies that the molecule is strongly bent in its ground
   electronic state. This discrepancy was explored theoretically by
   considering the lowest triplet (linear) and singlet (bent) states of
   NiH2. The relative energies of the two states have not been
   satisfactorily resolved, but the calculated structural and vibrational
   properties of the singlet state are in good agreement with the
   observations. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {The rotational spectrum of NiD in the lowest three vibrational levels (v
   = 0, 1, 2) of its ground 2DELTA state has been studied by far-infrared
   laser magnetic resonance (LMR). Transitions have been detected for all
   five isotopes of nickel and within both the lower  2DELTA5/2 and upper
   2DELTA3/2 spin components. The nuclear hyperfine splittings for the
   Ni-61 isotope (I = 3/2) have been resolved. An effective Hamiltonian has
   been used to fit the data which include the known vibration-rotational
   transitions within the 2DELTA5/2(v = 1 <-- v = 0) subsystem and a fine
   structure transition in the v = 0 level of the 2DELTA ground state,
   recently measured by CO2 LMR. From a parity splitting of the rotational
   transition within the X 2DELTA3/2 spin component we have determined the
   first LAMBDA-type doubling parameter for the X 2DELTA ground state. A
   set of molecular parameters for NiD in the 2DELTA ground state of NiD is
   given which allows a comparison with the parameter set for the well
   known NiH radical.},

Abstract = {In the present work we investigate the adequacy of broken-symmetry
   unrestricted density functional theory for constructing the potential
   energy curve of nickel dimer and nickel hydride, as a model for larger
   bare and hydrogenated nickel cluster calculations. We use three hybrid
   functionals: the popular B3LYP, Becke's newest optimized functional
   Becke98, and the simple FSLYP functional (50\% Hartree-Fock and 50\%
   Slater exchange and LYP gradient-corrected correlation functional) with
   two basis sets: all-electron (AE) Wachters+f basis set and Stuttgart RSC
   effective core potential (ECP) and basis set. We find that, overall, the
   best agreement with experiment, comparable to that of the high-level
   CASPT2, is obtained with B3LYP/AE, closely followed by Becke98/AE and
   Becke98/ECP. FSLYP/AE and B3LYP/ECP give slightly worse agreement with
   experiment, and FSLYP/ECP is the only method among the ones we studied
   that gives an unacceptably large error, underestimating the dissociation
   energy of Ni-2 by 28\%, and being in the largest disagreement with the
   experiment and the other theoretical predictions. We also find that for
   Ni-2, the spin projection for the broken-symmetry unrestricted singlet
   states changes the ordering of the states, but the splittings are less
   than 10 meV. All our calculations predict a deltadelta-hole ground state
   for Ni-2 and delta-hole ground state for NiH. Upon spin projection of
   the singlet state of Ni-2, almost all of our calculations: Becke98 and
   FSLYP both AE and ECP and B3LYP/AE predict (1)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y
   2)(B)) or (1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B)) ground state, which is a mixture of
   (1)Sigma(g)(+) and (1)Gamma(g). B3LYP/ECP predicts a (3)(d(x 2-y
   2)(A)d(xy)(B)) (mixture of (3)Sigma(g)(-) and (3)Gamma(u)) ground state
   virtually degenerate with the (1)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y
   2)(B))/(1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B)) state. The doublet delta-hole ground state
   of NiH predicted by all our calculations is in agreement with the
   experimentally predicted (2)Delta ground state. For Ni-2, all our
   results are consistent with the experimentally predicted ground state of
   0(g)(+) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and (3)Sigma(g)(-)) or 0(u)(-) (a
   mixture of (1)Sigma(u)(-) and (3)Sigma(u)(+)). (C) 2004 American

   both NiH and PtH, in addition to obtaining Zeeman information on the

   sub-Doppler spectra of the X Omega = 0.5 ground state have been recorded
   even though the upper state in the optical transition is strongly

   studies reveal that the g values in each state deviate from their
   nominal Hund's coupling case (a) or (b) value with increasing rotational
   quantum number J. This Zeeman information, in addition to providing a

   evidence of electronic state mixing (which is not present in ordinary
   non-Zeeman spectra) and useful in modeling the interactions between
   electronic states. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

   ability of MRS to simplify and presort spectra. The power of MRS
   originates from its specificity for low-J, DELTA-OMEGA = DELTA-J
   transitions and its ability, based on the sign and magnitude of the MRS
   effect, to partially presort rotational branches. A simple theoretical
   explanation of the MRS results, based on the structure of the underlying
   Zeeman pattern, is presented. Also, the extension of MRS to the more
   complicated and congested spectrum of CeF is presented. Using MRS, a
   previously unassigned CeF band, near 5 68 nm, has been definitively
   assigned as OMEGA' = 4.5 <-- OMEGA{''} = 3.5.},

Abstract = {The kinetic-energy dependences of the reactions of Ni(n)(+) (n=2-16)
   with D(2) are studied in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. The
   products observed are Ni(n)D(+) for all clusters and Ni(n)D(2)(+) for
   n=5-16. Reactions for formation of Ni(n)D(+) are observed to exhibit
   thresholds, whereas cross sections for formation of Ni(n)D(2)(+)
   (n=5-16) exhibit no obvious barriers to reaction. Rate constants of D(2)
   chemisorption on the cationic clusters are compared with results from
   previous work on neutral nickel clusters. Ni(n)(+)-D bond energies as a
   function of cluster size are derived from threshold analysis of the
   kinetic-energy dependence of the endothermic reactions, and are compared
   to previously determined metal-metal bond energies, D(0)(Ni(n)(+)-Ni).
   The bond energies of Ni(n)(+)-D generally increase as the cluster size
   increases, and parallel those for Ni(n)(+)-Ni for many clusters. These
   trends are explained in terms of electronic and geometric structures for
   the Ni(n)(+) clusters. The bond energies of Ni(n)(+)-D for larger
   clusters (ngreater than or equal to11) are found to be close to the
   value for chemsorption of atomic hydrogen on bulk phase nickel. (C) 2002

The force constants for diatomic molecules and isolated bonds may be expressed by using equalized electro-negativities, bond orders, bond strengths and interatomicdistances. We have studied Mn1H, Mn2H, Co2H, Ni1H, Ni2H, Cu1H, Cu2H, Ag1H, and Ag2H and have determined the proportionality constant d, as well as the Lennard-Jones parameters a and b, for the potential energy functions used by Szöke and calculated the anharmonicity [omega]e[xi]e and the rotational-vibrational coupling constant [alpha]e. The relation between electronegativity and ionization potential has been verified and the variations of molecular parameters with atomic number Z have been studied."

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Number = {11},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Abstract = {A method of analysis is proposed and applied to the rotational spectra
   of some diatomic molecules measured in the recent high-precision
   experiments. Such a spectrum is usually fitted by an 8th order
   polynomial assuming that the spectrum is a smooth function of angular
   momentum (the total angular momentum of the system). As a matter of
   fact, the measured spectra often show some irregularities (deviations
   from a smooth behavior) and this becomes clearly visible if one
   analyzes: the data in terms of the present method. This method of
   analysis therefore detects at which angular moments the irregularities
   occur in the data and such information would be most useful for
   understanding the nature of the perturbation which is responsible for
   the occurrence of irregularities. How the actual spectra would look like
   is discussed for a few selected cases in terms of simulations.},
