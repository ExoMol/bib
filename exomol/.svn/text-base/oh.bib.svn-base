Abstract = {Infrared OH lines at 1.55-1.56 mum in the H band were obtained with the
   Phoenix high-resolution spectrograph at the 2.1 m telescope of the Kitt
   Peak National Observatory for a sample of 14 metal-poor stars. Detailed
   analyses of the sample stars have been carried out, deriving stellar
   parameters based on two methods: (a) spectroscopic parameters and (b)
   infrared flux method (IRFM) effective temperatures, trigonometric
   gravities, and metallicities from Fe II lines. The Fe I lines present in
   the H-band region observed were well fitted by the stellar parameters
   within A{[}Fe/H] less than or equal to 0.15 dex. The oxygen abundances
   were derived from fits of spectrum synthesis calculations to the
   infrared OH lines. CO lines in the H and K bands were obtained for a
   subsample in order to determine their carbon abundances. Adopting the
   spectroscopic parameters, a mean oxygen-to-iron ratio of {[}O/Fe]
   approximate to 0.52 is obtained, whereas using the IRFM temperatures,
   Hipparcos gravities, and {[}Fe II/H], {[}O/Fe] approximate to 0.25 is
   found. A mean of the two methods gives a final value of {[}O/Fe]
   approximate to 0.4 for the metallicity range -2.2 < {[}Fe/H] < -1.2 of
   the sample metal-poor stars.},
