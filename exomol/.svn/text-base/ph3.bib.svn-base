  abstract = {Since the original suggestion by Gillett et al. (1969) it has generally

	Jupiter's atmosphere (the 5-/~m window) is bounded by the v4 NH~
	at 6.1 /~m and the va CH4 band at 3.3/~m. New measurements of Jupiter
	and of laboratory phosphine (PH3) samples show that PH3 is a significant
	contributor to the continuum opacity in the window and in fact defines
	its short-wavelength limit. This has important implications for the
	use of 5-/zm observations as a means to probe the deep atmospheric
	structure of Jupiter. The abundance of PH3 which results from a comparison
	of Jovian and laboratory spectra is about 3 to 5 cm-am. This is five
	to eight times less than that found by Larson et al. [Astrophys.

	pure sample of stibine was prepared, phosphine and arsine proved
	to be major impurities. They were separated from the sample; the
	microwave spectrometer was used to monitor the distillation process.
	The quadrupole fine structure associated with the absorption transitions
	for AsH2D is used to illustrate the special assumptions which may
	be made with these molecules having an axis of charge symmetry. These
	assumptions allow one to rotate the coordinate system from the chargesymmetry
	axes to the inertial axes without thereby adding unknown cross derivatives
	to the descriptions of the dyadic "inverse" \delta Ezz. Interpretation
	of the spectrum of SbH2D is more complicated. It is not found possible
	to fit the theory to the observed lines without making use of the
	second-order perturbations caused by a nearby level of different
	symmetry but of the same J. This perturbation involves the cross
	derivatives which had previously been assumed to be zero. With the
	assumption of cross derivatives approximately one percent of the
	diagonal terms, the theory fitted experiment within the experimental
	error. The electric quadrupole interaction in arsine and stibine
	is thus determined.
	
	In order to measure the electric dipole moment of arsine and stibine,
	a slight extension is made to the theory of asymmetric tops in a
	uniform electric field.
	
	The ground-state inversion splitting is determined to be less than
	0.5 Mc/sec for all three molecules.
	
	The rotational transitions observed were such that a determination

	and Moller-Plesset (MP2) level within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
	approximation. At the MP2 level the calculated 0+/0- v2 frequency
	splitting of the vibronic ground state of NH3/ND3 (0.729 cm -1/0.041
	cm-1) is in excellent agreement with the experimental values (0.794
	cm-1/0.053 cm-1). The tunneling rate for PH3 suggests that previously
	published values are wrong by orders of magnitude. Correlation effects
	do not change the barriers significantly in accordance with Freed's
	theorem. This has been studied in more detail for BiH3 at the quadratic
	configuration-interaction (QCI) level. Relativistic effects increase
	the barrier height of BiH3 by 81.6 kJ/mol at the QCI level. Nonrelativistic
	and relativistic extended Huckel calculations suggest that the a1
	highest occupied molecular orbital, which is antibonding to the Bi
	6s, relieves part of its antibonding character near equilibrium geometry
	due to the relativistic radial contraction of the 6s orbital and
	hence increases the barrier height. In the planar transition state
	this orbital is a nonbonding a2?. The increasing trend in barrier
	heights from NH3 to BiH3 can be explained by a second-order Jahn-Teller
	distortion of the trigonal planar geometry. Vibrational frequencies
	are predicted for BiH3.},
