Title = {Dielectric function of a-Si:H based on local network structures},
Journal = PRB,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {83},
Number = {19},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {For hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers prepared by
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, we have found clear
   relationships between the dielectric function in the ultraviolet/visible
   region and SiH(n) (n = 1-2) local bonding states by applying real-time
   spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared attenuated total reflection
   spectroscopy. In particular, the amplitude of the epsilon(2) spectra
   obtained from various a-Si:H layers is expressed completely by the
   SiH(2) bond density in the a-Si:H and reduces strongly with increasing
   the SiH(2) content, indicating that microvoids present in the a-Si:H
   network are surrounded by the SiH(2) bonding state. On the other hand,
   no significant void formation occurs by the generation of the SiH local
   bonding due to rather dense surrounding structures. Depending on the SiH
   n bonding states, the whole a-Si:H dielectric function shifts toward
   higher energies, as the SiH(n) hydrogen contents in the a-Si:H increase.
   Based on these findings, we have established a new a-Si:H dielectric
   function model that incorporates the void structure terminated with
   SiH(2) and epsilon(2) spectral shift induced by the SiH n local
   structures. This model is appropriate for a wide variety of a-Si:H
   layers deposited at different substrate temperatures and plasma
   conditions and, conversely, allows the characterization of the SiH n
   contents from the a-Si:H dielectric functions in the ultraviolet/visible
   region. From results obtained in this study, the local network
   structures and electronic states of a-Si:H are discussed.},

Title = {Overcoming systematic DFT errors for hydrocarbon reaction energies},
Journal = {TCA},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {127},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {429-442},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite the widespread use and numerous successful applications of
   density functional theory, descriptions of hydrocarbon reaction energies
   remain problematic. Illustrative examples include large underestimation
   of energies associated with alkane bond separation reactions and poor
   general description of intramolecular dispersion in hydrocarbons (e.g.,
   B3LYP, MAD = 14.1 kcal mol(-1)). More recent, but not readily availably
   functionals, along with efficient posteriori corrections, not only show
   considerable improvement in the energy description of hydrocarbons but
   also help identify the sources of error in traditional DFT. Interactions
   in branched alkanes and compact hydrocarbons are adequately mimicked by
   systems compressed below their typical van der Waals distances. At these
   distances, standard DFT exchange functionals are overly repulsive for
   non-bonded density overlaps, and significant improvement is offered by
   the long-range corrected exchange functionals (e.g., LC-BLYP0.33, MAD =
   5.5 kcal mol(-1)). For those systems, the neglect of long-range
   dispersion is found to be a critical shortcoming, as well as ``overlap
   dispersion{''}, for which non-negligible amounts are captured by the
   correlation functional. Accounting for the missing dispersion
   interactions is of key importance. Accordingly, most noteworthy
   improvements over standard functionals are obtained by using non-local
   van der Waals density functionals (e.g., LC-S-VV09, MAD = 3.6 kcal
   mol(-1), rPW86-VV09, MAD = 5.8 kcal mol(-1)), a dispersion corrected
   double hybrid (B2PLYP-D, MAD = 2.5 kcal mol(-1)), or by the addition of
   an atom pairwise density-dependent dispersion correction to a standard
   functional (e.g., PBE-dDXDM, MAD = 0.8 kcal mol(-1)). To a lesser
   extent, the reduction of the delocalization error (e.g., MCY3, MAD = 6.3
   kcal mol(-1)) or careful parameter fitting (e.g., M06-2X, MAD = 5.6 kcal
   mol(-1)) also lowers the errors.},

Abstract = {A set of 24 mixed silicon hydrides and halides (SiH(n)X(m-n), where X =
   F, Cl; m = 1-4; and n = 0-m) has been investigated using; (1) CCSD(T)

   the correlation consistent basis sets for the second row atoms (Si and

   approach (ccCA). Optimized geometries and harmonic vibrational
   frequencies are reported, as well as enthalpies of formation, free
   energies of formation, and dissociation reaction enthalpies.
   Relativistic effects, including atomic spin-orbit coupling and scalar
   relativistic effects, and core-valence correlation, have been accounted
   for via the ccCA formulism. As demonstrated in previous studies, the
   tight d basis sets accelerate the convergence, as compared to the
   standard correlation consistent basis sets, of CCSD(T)-computed
   geometries and energetics of molecular species containing second row,

   similar and, on average, better than the corresponding CCSD(T)
   enthalpies of formation for the silicon species. Further, large

Abstract = {Atomization energies at 0 K and heats of formation at 0 and 298 K are

   for first order atomic spin-orbit effects. Vibrational zero point

Abstract = {Recently, the size extensive, ab initio effective valence shell
   Hamiltonian method for spin-orbit coupling has been suggested. In
   essence, this effective Hamiltonian method is equivalent to the
   quasidegenerate perturbation theory. But the difference lies in
   transforming the original Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian
   acting within a relatively small valence in the effective valence shell
   Hamiltonian method. One advantage of the method is that the spin-orbit
   coupling energies of all valence states for both the neutral species and
   its ions are simultaneously determined with a similar accuracy from a
   single computation of the effective spin-orbit coupling operator. Thus,
   fine structure splittings are predicted for a number of states of each
   system for which neither experiment nor theory is available. To assess
   the accuracy of the effective Hamiltonian method more extensively, test
   calculations are performed for the spin-orbit splittings in the valence
   states of small diatomic hydrides and their ions. The calculated
   spin-orbit splittings are generally in good agreement with experiments
   and with other ab initio computations.},

   method combined with the distorted-wave approximation is used to solve
   the scattering equations. Comparisons were made between the calculated
   cross sections for SiH and SiF as well as with the existing experimental
   and theoretical data for electron scattering by silane molecule. Some

Abstract = {The astrophysical importance of the SiH radical has motivated
   significant experimental and theoretical work. However, only the X (2)Pi
   and A (2)Delta states of SiH have been extensively investigated
   experimentally, while the study of higher excited states is rather
   limited. From a theoretical point of view, most of the studies have been
   focused on spectroscopic and thermochemical quantities of the ground
   state. The lack of accurate spectroscopic parameters
   (r(e),D-e,omega(e),omega(e)x(e),alpha(e),(D) over bar (e),T-e)
   pertaining to higher excited states was the driving force of the present

   coupled with very large correlation-consistent basis sets, we have
   constructed potential energy curves for 18 molecular states correlating
   to Si(P-3,D-1,S-1,S-5,P-3,P-1)+H(S-2). At the same level, the potential
   energy curve of the ground SiH+ state (X (1)Sigma(+)) has also been
   constructed. We report total energies, dissociation energies, and the
   usual spectroscopic constants for Si-28-H-1,H-2 and for all states
   studied. Most of our results are in excellent agreement with existing
   experimental values. In particular, we believe that our dissociation

   reported so far in the literature. (C) 2002 American Institute of

Abstract = {Radical species produced in catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD),
   often called hot-wire CVD, processes were identified by using a laser
   induced fluorescence technique. Ground state Si atoms could be detected
   at low pressures where collisional processes in the gas phase could be
   ignored. The electronic temperature of Si atoms just after the formation
   on the catalyzer (tungsten) surfaces was 1320 +/- 490 K, when the
   catalyzer temperature was 2300 K. By the addition of 0.5 Pa of Ar, the
   electronic temperature was lowered down to 450 +/- 30 K. The absolute
   density of Si atoms was 3 +/- 1x10(9) cm(-3) at 10 cm below the
   catalyzer when the flow rate and the pressure of SiH4 were 0.5 sccm and
   4 mPa, respectively. This density is just 0.3\% of that of the parent

   can be concluded that atomic silicon is one of the major products on the

   Previous applications of the BEB theory to the silicon hydrides and
   fluorides have employed a combination of experimental and Koopman's
   theorem binding energies. In the current work binding energies have been
   calculated using the explicitly correlated multiconfigurational spin

   Hartree-Fock (HF)/Koopman's theorem results and available experimental

Abstract = {Electron capture in collisions of C, N, O, and Si atoms with H+ ions is
   studied theoretically based on a molecular representation within a fully
   quantum framework by including six molecular channels both for the
   ground and excited states for the {[}H+ + C] system, and four channels
   for the ground-state {[}H+ + N] and {[}H+ + O] systems. For the {[}H+ +
   Si] system, we employed the molecular representation both in fully
   quantum and semiclassical frameworks to investigate electron capture at
   higher energy as well. The ab initio potential curves and nonadiabatic
   coupling matrix elements for all these systems are obtained from
   multireference single- and double-excitation configuration interaction
   calculations. For all systems, the effect of excited atoms on electron
   capture is examined in addition to that from the ground state. Because
   of a small asymptotic energy defect (near-resonant processes) between
   the initial and closest electron capture channels for almost all
   systems, electron capture cross sections from the ground-state atoms are
   large with values of approximately 10(-16) - 10(-15) cm(2) for all
   systems at above 100 eV. Corresponding rate coefficients are found to be
   much smaller than those previously reported for the NH+ and OH+, but, on
   the contrary, found to be larger by a few orders of magnitude than the
   previously estimated value for the SiH+ system. Those from excited
   states are also found to be extremely efficient for all cases.},

Abstract = {We report measurements of absolute cross sections for the
   electron-impact ionization and dissociative ionization of the SiDx
   (x=1-3) free radicals from threshold to 200 eV using the
   fast-neutral-beam technique. The deuterated rather than the protonated
   target species were used in order to allow a better separation of the
   various product ions from a given parent in our apparatus. A common
   feature of all three radicals studied in this work is a dominant parent
   ionization cross section with essentially the same absolute value of
   roughly 3.7x10(-6) cm(2) at 70 eV. Dissociative ionization processes for
   all three targets are less significant with a single dissociative
   process dominating in each case, viz. the removal of a single D atom
   (SiDx+e(-)-->SiDx-1++D+2e(-)). The cross section for this dominant
   dissociative ionization channel also had the same maximum value of about
   1.2X10(-6) cm(2) for all three targets. A comparison of the
   experimentally determined total single ionization cross sections with
   calculated cross sections using a modified additivity rule showed good
   to satisfactory agreement for all three targets in terms of the absolute
   values, but reveals some discrepancies in the cross section shapes. (C)

Abstract = {A quantitative absorption diagnostic for ppm amounts of silylidyne
   radicals (SiH) was developed. The SiH radicals were produced in high
   diluted mixtures of silane (SiH4) in Ar with and without additional H-2
   at high temperatures. The experiments were performed in the reaction
   zone behind reflected shock waves at temperatures between 1300 and 3000
   K and at pressures 0.9 less than or equal to p less than or equal to
   2.5bar. The SiH radicals were detected by time-resolved narrow-bandwidth
   laser absorption measurements near lambda = 413 nm. A spectroscopic
   model was introduced to describe the absorption cross section of the SiH
   single line transitions in the A-X(0,0) band. The SiH
   absorption-over-time profiles could be transformed into concentration
   time histories by applying this model. The detection limit of the
   present quantitative ring dye laser absorption diagnostic for shock tube
   applications was about 1 x 10(12) cm(-3) and is thus well suited for
   kinetic studies of elementary reactions involving SiH radicals.

Abstract = {SiH bond activation, oxidative addition of the SiH bond of SiH4 to
   coordinatively unsaturated RhCl (PH3)2, was theoretically investigated
   with an ab initio molecular orbital (MO) method, and its potential
   energy profile was compared with that for CH bond activation, oxidative
   addition of the CH bond of CH4. All the stationary points were
   determined at the MP2 level. While CH bond activation passes through an
   eta2-CH4 complex and a three-centered transition state, SiH bond
   activation is downhill and the eta2-SiH4 complex is a transition state
   for intramolecular rearrangement connecting two silyl hydride complexes,
   the products of SiH bond activation. This difference originates from the
   much larger exothermicity of SiH bond activation due to the weaker SiH
   bond and the stronger RhSi bond compared with the C counterparts. The
   RhSi bond is about 20 kcal/mol stronger than the RhC bond; the large
   electron donation from SiH3 to Rh can take place in the late transition
   metal complex to stabilize the electropositive silyl group. However, the
   order in M-R bond strength depends on the transition metal. In the Zr
   complex, a strong back-donation from Zr to CH3 takes place because of
   the small electronegativity of Zr, resulting in the ZrC bond being
   stronger than the ZrSi bond. For Si2H6, activation of both the SiH and
   the SiSi bond takes place easily, and RhCl(PH3)2(SiH3)2 and
   HRhCl(PH3)2(Si2H5) can rearrange with each other intramolecularly. Also,
   the electron correlation effect on structure and energetics is
   discussed.},

   orbital basis sets and coupled cluster methods including all single,

   Core-correlation effects on the bond dissociation energies have been
   explicitly evaluated. For the intermediate hydrides CH(n) and SiH(n)
   (n=1-3), heats of formation are determined from theoretical bond
   dissociation energies in two ways: using experimental heats of formation
   of the H and C (or Si) atoms; and using experimental heats of formation
   of the H atom and the parent hydrides CH4 (or SiH4). In principle, this
   procedure allows us to place rigorous upper and lower bounds on the
   heats of formation of the intermediate hydrides. Because our
   theoretically predicted atomization energies are already of high
   quality, estimation of remaining deficiencies in the one-particle basis
   sets can be obtained from extrapolation of observed trends in
   atomization energies upon basis set expansion. These extrapolated
   results are in outstanding agreement with experimental values where they
   are known to high accuracy. For the SiH(n) compounds, a serious problem
   occurs: our predicted atomization energy of SiH4 is larger than that
   obtained from experimental heats of formation for the silicon atom and
   silane. Thus either relativistic effects on the atomization energy of
   SiH4 are large, or the experimental heats of formation of Si and SiH4
   are incompatible. Excepting the atomization energy of SiH4, and thus the
   heats of formation of Si and SiH4, none of our other SiH(n)
   thermochemical predictions (properly interpreted) are clearly
   incompatible with experiment. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions
