  abstract = {The overtone spectra of SiHD{,} SiHD and SiHD in the range 2000-9000
	cm have been measured up to 720000 Pa m using a Bruker 120HR interferometer.
	The transition frequencies and intensities are reported. The observed
	band centers are found to be in good agreement with the predictions
	from high order canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory (CVPT) calculations.
	A four-dimensional Si-H stretching dipole moment surface (DMS) has
	been determined from coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] methods and expanded
	using a bond dipole model and a Cartesian model. The band intensities
	of the Si-H and Si-D stretching transitions have been computed employing
	these expansions and a local mode force field optimized to the observed
	band centers. The calculations agree reasonably well with observations
	for most bands. The vibrational intensity anomaly in the third local
	mode manifolds is partly reproduced and is attributed to the cancellation
	of linear and quadratic terms in the DMS.},
