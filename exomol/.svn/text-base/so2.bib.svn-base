Abstract = {{Spectra of (a) over tilde B-3(1)(nu (1)nu (2)nu (3))=(110) and (200)-(X)
   over tilde (1)A(1)(000) of (SO2)-S-32 and (SO2)-S-34 are obtained in a
   supersonic jet at a resolution 0.015 cm(-1). The rotational structures
   are analyzed for both isotopic species to obtain precise rotational and
   spin constants. Two new bands at 27 032.222(1) and 27 515.41(1) cm-1
   arising from vibronic interaction separately with vibrational state
   (110) and (200) of (a) over tilde B-3(1) are assigned to transitions to
   (b) over tilde (3)A(2)(011) and (101). The rotational structure of (b)
   over tilde (3)A(2) is observed and analyzed for the first time. The two
   vibrational states are analyzed to yield effective rotational constants
   A=1.4348(3), 1.89(3), B=0.3610(3), 0.412(3), and C=0.2689(3), 0.239(3)
   cm(-1), respectively. Then the difference nu (1)-nu (2) of vibrational
   frequency of (b) over tilde (3)A(2) is obtained to be 483.19 cm(-1).
   Because of interaction to (b) over tilde (3)A(2)(011) the observed
   spacing of K stack and spin constants alpha and beta for (a) over tilde
   B-3(1)(110) are smaller whereas the state (a) over tilde B-3(1)(200) is
   relatively unaffected and only spin constants vary significantly. }},

Title = {{Laser-induced phosphorescence of SO2 in solid neon: Direct observation
   of the (b)over-tilde(3)A(2) state in the (OSO)-O-16-O-18 molecule}},
Journal = JPCA

Abstract = {{Laser excitation of isotopically labeled SO2 molecules in a neon matrix
   has allowed the measurement of dispersed phosphorescence spectra ((a)
   over tilde(3)B(1)-(X) over tilde(1)A(1)) in the wavelength region
   387.5-526.3 nm (19 000-25 800 cm(-1)). The origin of the (a) over
   tilde-(X) over tilde transition lies at 25 747 cm(-1) in
   (OSO)-O-16-O-16, shifted 18 cm(-1) to the red from the gas phase; the
   three vibrational frequencies of the (X) over tilde state are nearly
   unperturbed in the neon matrix (1149, 520, and 1362 cm(-1)). As the
   zero-phonon lines are sharp and well resolved, it has been possible to
   monitor emission from a specific isotopomer to obtain its excitation
   spectrum. The excitation spectra of matrix-isolated (OSO)-O-16-O-16 and
   (OSO)-O-18-O-18 in the region 350.9-388.5 nm (25 740-28 500 cm(-1)) are
   similar to those previously observed in the gas phase, with strong
   perturbations affecting all vibrational levels above a(3)B(1)(110) at 27
   005 cm(-1) (370 nm). Two additional groups of bands are observed for the
   unsymmetrical isotopomer (OSO)-O-18-O-16; they are identified as
   transitions to levels of the (a) over tilde(3)B(1) state with v(3) = 1
   and as direct transitions to the (b) over tilde(3)A(2) state, which both
   become allowed in the lower symmetry. The v(3) frequency of the (a) over
   tilde(3)B(1) state of (OSO)-O-18-O-16 is 922 cm(-1); for the (b) over
   tilde(3)A(2) state, v(1) similar or equal to 791 cm(-1) and v(2) similar
   or equal to 315 cm(-1), while the (b) over tilde (001) level lies 26 653
   cm(-1) above the (X) over tilde (000) level.}},

   in the jet of engine exhaust gases}},
Journal = {{RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {473-482},
Abstract = {{The feasibility of SO2 registration in the plume of a jet engine as one
   of the methods of monitoring of its operation quality is investigated.
   Spectral characteristics are calculated using the line by line method,
   information-computing complex TRAVA developed by the authors, and the
   compiled spectroscopic database on high-temperature SO2. Unlike the
   HITRAN database, the original spectroscopic data possess predictability
   up to T = 1500 K. It is established that in case of active SO2 detection
   using a CO laser, the laser line corresponding to the 32-31 D 5
   transition is promising for temperatures T = 300-1100 K. In addition,
   the most suitable range of the spectrum for passive sensing of hot SO2
   in the engine plume - 1330.0-1331.6 cm(-1) - is established in which the
   useful signal level exceeds background radiation for a minimum SO2
   concentration (5 ppm).}},
