Title = {Volcano related atmospheric toxicants in Hilo and Hawaii Volcanoes
   National Park: Implications for human health},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {555-563},
Abstract = {Volcanic fog (vog)from Kilauea volcano on the island of Hawaii includes
   a variety of chemical species including sulfur compounds and traces of
   metals such as mercury. The metal species seen tended to be in the
   nanograms per cubic meter range, whereas oxides of sulfur: SO2 and SO3
   and sulfate aerosols, were in the range of micrograms per cubic meter
   and rarely even as high as a few milligrams per cubic meter of air
   (nominally ppb to ppm). These sulfur species are being investigated for
   associations with both acute and chronic changes in human health status.
   The sulfate aerosols tend to be less than 1 mu m in diameter and tend to
   dominate the mass of this submicron size mode. The sulfur chemistry is
   dynamic, changing composition from predominantly sulfur dioxide and
   trioxide gasses near the volcano, to predominantly sulfate aerosols on
   the west side of the island. Time, concentration and composition
   characteristics of submicron aerosols and sulfur dioxide are described
   with respect to the related on-going health studies and public health
   management concerns. Exposures to sulfur dioxide and particulate matter
   equal to or less than 1 mu m in size were almost always below the
   national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). These standards do not
   however consider the acidic nature and submicron size of the aerosol,
   nor the possibility of the aerosol and the sulfur dioxide interacting in
   their toxicity. Time series plots, histograms and descriptive statistics
   of hourly averages give the reader a sense of some of the exposures
   observed.},

Abstract = {We have demonstrated a high-sensitivity, room-temperature

   probe infrared absorption features at 7.50 and 7.16 mu m for SO2 and
   SO3, respectively, with a common dual-beam detection system. We inferred
   a noise-equivalent absorbance of similar to 1 X 10(-4) Hz(-1/2). We have
   demonstrated detection limits for both SO2 and SO3 of 1-2 ppmv m/Hz(1/2)
   (where ppmv is parts in 106 by volume) for 300 torr, elevated
   temperature, and path lengths near 1 m. This level of sensitivity
   permits measurement of <1 ppmv of SO2 and SO3 at these conditions with
   modest signal averaging. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.},

Title = {Photolysis of sulphuric acid as the source of sulphur oxides in the
   mesosphere of Venus},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {834-837},
Abstract = {The sulphur cycle plays fundamental roles in the chemistry(1-3) and
   climate(4,5) of Venus. Thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry at the
   surface of Venus favours the production of carbonyl sulphide(6) and to a
   lesser extent sulphur dioxide. These gases are transported to the middle
   atmosphere by the Hadley circulation cell(7,8). Above the cloud top, a
   sulphur oxidation cycle involves conversion of carbonyl sulphide into
   sulphur dioxide, which is then transported further upwards. A
   significant fraction of this sulphur dioxide is subsequently oxidized to
   sulphur trioxide and eventually reacts with water to form sulphuric
   acid(3). Because the vapour pressure of sulphuric acid is low, it
   readily condenses and forms an upper cloud layer at altitudes of 60-70
   km, and an upper haze layer above 70 km (ref. 9), which effectively
   sequesters sulphur oxides from photochemical reactions. Here we present
   simulations of the fate of sulphuric acid in the Venusian mesosphere
   based on the Caltech/JPL kinetics model(3,10), but including the
   photolysis of sulphuric acid. Our model suggests that the mixing ratios
   of sulphur oxides are at least five times higher above 90 km when the
   photolysis of sulphuric acid is included. Our results are inconsistent
   with the previous model results but in agreement with the recent
   observations using ground-based microwave spectroscopy(11) and by Venus
   Express(12).},

Title = {Evaluation of SO3 Measurement Techniques in Air and Oxy-Fuel Combustion},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {5537-5549},
Abstract = {SO2 is enriched in wry-fuel combustion due to flue-gas recycle, and a
   significant higher SO3 concentration can be expected compared to
   air-firing. Since SO3 can cause high and low temperature corrosion, it
   is important to measure the SO3 concentration under oxy-fuel fired
   conditions. However, measurement of SO3 is not straightforward, since
   SO3 is a highly reactive gas. This paper presents an experimental study
   in the Chalmers oxy-fuel test unit, comparing different SO3 measurement
   techniques applied during oxy-fuel and air combustion. Propane (60
   kW(th)) was used as fuel and SO2 was injected in the oxidizer to
   generate a controllable amount of SO3. The SO3 concentration was
   measured with four techniques: the controlled condensation method, the
   salt method, the isopropanol absorption bottle method, and with the
   Pentol SO3 monitor (previously: Severn Science analyzer). The controlled
   condensation method was used as the standard for comparison.
   Additionally, the acid dew-point temperature was measured with a
   dew-point meter. The controlled condensation and the salt method gave
   comparable results, and the repeatability with these methods was good.
   The SO3 concentrations measured with the Pentol SO3 monitor differed in
   average less than 20\% from the SO3 concentrations obtained with the
   controlled condensation method. With the isopropanol absorption bottle
   method, a large amount of the SO2 was absorbed in the isopropanol
   solution, which gives a positive bias if the SO2 is oxidized to sulfate
   in the isopropanol solution. This was minimized by reducing the
   measurement time, bubbling argon through the absorption bottles after
   the measurement to force the SO2 out, and analyzing the solution
   immediately after the measurement. No principal differences between
   measuring the SO3 concentration during oxy-fuel combustion and
   air-firing were obtained. However, a correction factor for the mass flow
   meter of the Pentol SO3 monitor has to be used because of the high CO,
   concentration during oxy-fuel operation.},
