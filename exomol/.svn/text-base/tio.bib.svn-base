Abstract = {We have carried out calculations of re-vibrational energy levels of the
   13 lowest electronic states of TiO. The dominant couplings between the
   various states are included, with the coupling parameters and potential
   parameters optimized to match experimental energy levels. We have also
   performed ab initio electronic structure calculations of the spin-orbit
   and rotation-orbit couplings, to verify that the physical results are
   obtained from the optimization. Our wavefunctions were used to predict
   the intensities of both well characterized and unobserved forbidden
   bands.},

Journal = AA,

Volume = {330},
Pages = {1109-1119},
Abstract = {From near-infrared, narrow-band photometry of 256 oxygen-rich Mira
   variables we obtain evidence about the loops that these stars follow in
   colour-colour diagrams. We also find a phase lag between indices related
   to molecular band-strength of titanium oxide and vanadium oxide. We
   compute colours for normal M-giants and Miras using hydrostatic and
   hydrodynamic model atmospheres and very extensive up-to-date line lists.
   Normal M-giants colours are well reproduced, reaching a high
   quantitative agreement with observations for spectral types earlier than
   M7. The out-of-phase variations of the various spectral features of
   Miras are also acceptably reproduced, despite limitations in the
   modelling. This enables us to confirm that the phase lag phenomenon
   results from the propagation of perturbations in the extended
   atmosphere. It opens new perspectives in the spectral modelling of
   Miras.}

Year = {1998},

Pages = {495-500},
Abstract = {A new line list for 9 electronic transitions of TiO (alpha, beta, gamma,
   gamma', delta, epsilon, phi, a-f, and E-B) is presented and made
   publicly available. It is the latest and much improved version of a
   suite of TiO line lists inaugurated in Plez et al. (1992). It includes
   the transition moments of Langhoff (1997) and provides a better match to
   both high- and low-resolution spectra of cool stars than any previous
   extensive TiO line list. It is shown to be adequate for most purposes in
   stellar atmosphere modelling sind spectroscopy. The line strengths
   appear to match observations very well, except for a mismatch of the
   delta band system, when using Langhoff's transition moment. It appears
   too strong in the calculations. It would be very valuable to perform
   accurate lifetime and branching ratios measurements for the delta and
   phi transitions.}}

Title = {{Theoretical study of the spectroscopy of TiO}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{481}},
Pages = {1007-1015},
Abstract = {{Theoretical electronic transition moments are presented for all of the
   dipole-allowed transitions connecting the f(1) Delta, c(1) Phi, b(1) Pi,
   d(1) Sigma(+), and a(1) Delta singlet states and the C-3 Delta, B-3 Pi,
   A(3) Phi, E-3 Pi, and X-3 Delta triplet states of TiO. The transition
   moments connecting the C-3 Delta state with lower states were determined
   at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level, and
   the transition moments connecting the other states were determined at
   both the CASSCF and the internally contracted multireference
   configuration-interacti on (IC-MRCI) level. The CASSCF active space can
   be made sufficiently large that the effect of electron correlation on
   the transition moments is included quantitatively. The theoretical
   radiative lifetimes for the short-lived states are generally within 10\%
   of the recent laser fluorescence measurements of Hedgecock, Naulin, \&
   Costes. For the v = 0 level of the E-3 Pi. state, we obtain a radiative
   lifetime of 4259 ns, consistent with their determination of tau(v=0) >
   2000 ns, but much longer than the lifetime of 770 +/- 40 ns reported by
   Simard \& Hackett. Except for the 8-bands, the theoretical oscillator
   strengths are less than those currently employed in molecular opacity
   calculations.}},
