Abstract = {We present a comprehensive description of the theory and practice of
   opacity calculations from the infrared to the ultraviolet needed to
   generate models of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant
   planets. Methods for using existing line lists and spectroscopic
   databases in disparate formats are presented, and plots of the resulting
   absorptive opacities versus wavelength for the most important molecules
   and atoms at representative temperature/pressure points are provided.
   Electronic, rovibrational, bound-free, bound-bound, free-free, and
   collision-induced transitions and monochromatic opacities are derived,
   discussed, and analyzed. The species addressed include the alkali
   metals, iron, heavy metal oxides, metal hydrides, H-2, H2O, CH4, CO,
   NH3, H2S, PH3, and representative grains. Once monochromatic absorption
   cross sections for all constituents have been derived, chemical
   abundances have to be obtained before the resulting product can be
   summed to obtain total opacities. Hence, we include a review of the
   thermochemistry, techniques, and databases needed to derive equilibrium
   abundances and provide some sample results.},

Title = {Hybrid density functional theory study of vanadium monoxide},
Journal = PRB,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {69},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {First-principles calculations of nondefective VO in the Fm (3) over barm
   structure based on a range of single-particle Hamiltonians containing
   varying amounts of exact exchange indicate that the ground electronic
   state is that of a d(3) high spin, antiferromagnetic (AF), Mott-Hubbard
   insulator with an AF(1) spin alignment of the local cation moments. This
   description remains essentially unchanged down to 10\% exact exchange,
   and only for the pure density functional theory (DFT) potential is the
   AF(1) phase found to be metallic. Strong spin-lattice interaction is
   predicted with differences in lattice constant of up to 1.6\% between
   AF(1) and FM (ferromagnetic) order. The AF(1) lattice constant is
   predicted to be similar to4.37 Angstrom, which is roughly 7\% greater
   than the reported lattice constants for the defective material. The bulk
   modulus is comparable to those of CaO, MnO, and NiO. A mapping of total
   energies onto an Ising spin Hamiltonian containing both direct and
   superexchange interactions reveals the dominant magnetic interaction to
   be the direct coupling of antiferromagnetically aligned nearest-neighbor
   cation spins, which leads to the stability of the AF(1) phase. Direct
   coupling energies are found in the range -11.1 to -44.3 meV as the
   proportion of exact exchange is reduced, leading to an estimated
   critical disorder temperature in the range 300-450 K. However, the
   limitations of such mapping are exposed by a consideration of the
   relative stabilities of the AF(1) and AF(3) alignments. Orbital
   projected densities of states reveal filled to unfilled gaps which
   depend strongly on the proportion of exact exchange and for the B3LYP
   potential (20\% exact exchange) are similar to2.5 eV for the
   spin-forbidden xy(up arrow)-->xy(down arrow) excitation, similar to3.0
   eV for xy(up arrow)-->z(2)(up arrow), and similar to3.5 eV for V-->O
   charge transfer. Variationally stable, highly local crystal-field
   excited states ranging in energy from similar to0.6 to similar to2.7 eV
   are predicted for exchange-correlation potentials down to 30\% exact
   exchange and from comparisons with the corresponding band excitation
   estimates of similar to1 to similar to2 eV are obtained for the
   localization energy of Frenkel excitons. From a mapping of the excited
   crystal-field energies onto a Kanamori Hamiltonian, values are obtained
   for the lattice Racah B and C parameters and the d-orbital averaged
   exchange and crystal-field energies. A comparison of mapped and directly
   calculated energies of the two-electron excitation
   (xz,yz)-->(z(2),x(2)-y(2)) confirms the validity of Kanamori mapping,
   notably in the limit of exact exchange.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Number = {11},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Abstract = {Resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization spectra of vanadium monoxide

   system allowing the first direct determination of a spin-orbit coupling

   provide absolute energies for several doublet electronic states with

   3d elements: A comparative density functional study},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {128},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {The 3d-element transition metal dioxide MO(2), peroxide M(O(2)), and
   superoxide MOO clusters (M=Sc-Zn), are studied by density functional
   theory with the B1LYP functional. The reliability of the methods and
   basis sets employed was tested by a reinvestigation of the monoxides,
   for which a database of experimental data is available. The global
   minima on the M+O(2) potential energy surfaces correspond to dioxide
   structure, the only exception being CuOO, with a superoxide structure.
   All Zn dioxygen clusters are thermodynamically unstable-their ground
   states lie higher than the dissociation limit to Zn+O(2). Our
   calculations are in favor of the high-spin configurations for the
   FeO(2), CoO(2), and NiO(2) ground states, which are still a subject of
   extensive theoretical and experimental studies. These assignments are
   confirmed by the coupled-cluster method, CCSD(T), except for NiO(2).
   Based on the existence of a stable NiO(2) monoanion in a (4)B(1) state,
   however, it can be concluded that NiO(2) in its (5)A(1) state should
   also be stable. The vibrational frequencies are calculated for clusters
   entrapped in the cubic cell of solid Ar matrix and compared with those
   obtained for gas-phase clusters. The matrix has no influence on the
   vibrations of the monoxides and most of the dioxides; however, Co and
   Ni-dioxoclusters interact strongly with the atoms from the noble gas
   matrix. The most intense frequencies in the IR spectra are shifted to
   lower energies and the ordering of the low-lying electronic states by
   stability is also reversed. According to the electrostatic potential
   maps, the oxygen atoms in the peroxides are more nucleophilic than those
   in the dioxides and superoxides. The terminal oxygen atom in superoxides
   is more nucleophilic than its M-bonded oxygen atom, though charge
   distribution analysis predicts a smaller negative charge on the terminal
   oxygen. TiO(2) is the only dioxide in which nucleophilic character in
   the vicinity of the metal cation is induced. (C) 2008 American Institute

   ((2)A `'), VO4 ((2)A(2)) and VO5 (B-4(2)) The geometric configurations
   of the ground states VOx (x = 3 similar to 5) are stereo- structures,
   which exhibit obvious John-Teller or Renner-Teller effect, that is, the
   higher the stability is, the lower the symmetry is. Their first vertical
   ionization energies increase with the number of oxygen atoms in VOx (x =
   1 similar to 4). The molecule VO3 ((2)A `') has the largest vertical
   electron affinity energy in VOx (x = 1 similar to 5) and the strongest
   attraction for electron among these molecules. The energy of the highest
   occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) decreases with the number of oxygen
   atoms in VOx, (x = 1 similar to 4), but the rule can not be applied to
   VO5. From he views of electron transition, the VO4 molecule has the most

Abstract = {The pure rotational spectra of VN (X-3 Delta(r)) and VO (X-4 Sigma(-))
   have been recorded in the frequency range 290-520 GHz using direct
   absorption spectroscopy. These radicals were synthesized in the
   gas-phase from the reaction Of VCl4 with either N-2 or H2O in an AC
   discharge. Seven rotational transitions were recorded for each molecule;
   in both sets of spectra, fine and hyperfine structures were resolved.
   The data sets for VN and VO were fit with Hund's case (a) and case (b)
   Hamiltonians, respectively, and rotational, fine structure, and
   hyperfine constants determined. For VN, however, an additional hyperfine
   parameter, Delta a, was necessary for the analysis of the Omega = 2
   sublevel to account for perturbations from a nearby (1)Delta state, in
   addition to the usual Frosch and Foley constants. Determination of Delta
   a suggests that the (1)Delta state lies similar to 3000 cm(-1) above the
   ground state. In VO, the hyperfine structure in the F-2 and F-3
   components was found to become heavily mixed due to an avoided crossing,
   predicted by previous optical studies to be near the N = 15 level. The
   hyperfine constants established for these two molecules are consistent
   with the proposed sigma(1)delta(1) and sigma(1)delta(2) electron
   configurations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Bond distances, vibrational frequencies, electron affinities, ionization
   potentials, and dissociation energies of the diatomic 5d transition
   metal (except La) monoxides and their positively and negatively charged
   ions were studied by use of density functional methods B3LYP, BLYP,
   B3PW91, BPW91, B3P86, BP86, MPW1PW91, PBE1PBE, and SVWN. Our calculation
   shows that for each individual species, the calculated properties are
   quite sensitive to the method used. Compared with hybrid density
   functional method B3PW91 (B3P86), pure density functional method BPW91
   (BP86) gives longer bond distance (lower vibrational frequency) from HfO
   to PtO for neutral species, HfO+ to IrO+ for cationic species, and HfO-
   to AuO- for anionic species. While for B3LYP and BLYP, the trend was
   observed for cationic species from HfO+ to IrO+ and anionic species from
   HfO- to AuO- (except TaO-), but not for neutrals. Pure density function
   methods BLYP, BPW91, and BP86 give larger dissociation energy compared
   with hybrid density functional methods B3LYP, B3PW91, and B3P86. SVWN in
   most cases gives the smallest bond distance, while BLYP gives the
   largest value. MPW1PW91 and PBE1PBE show the same performance in
   predicting the spectroscopic constants. In addition, useful empirical
   criteria that one has obtained the ground states of a species and its
   ions are the spin multiplicities of a neutral and its single charged
   ions which differs by +/- 1.},

Abstract = {High-resolution spectra of VO have been reinvestigated in the

   present in the system as an impurity. Three new bands observed in the
   21000-22100 cm(-1) region have been attributed to a new
   (2)Delta-1(2)Delta electronic transition of VO. Two bands, with origins
   near 21044 and 22038 cm(-1), have been assigned as the 0-1 and 0-0 bands

Abstract = {Non-local, density functional calculations have been performed on the
   ground and low-lying excited states of the 3d transition metal monoxide

   lengths, bond energies, vibrational force constants and dipole moments

   the electronic structures of the molecules reveals the d-orbital
   splitting to be d(pi)> d(sigma)greater than or equal to d(delta) and
   shows the non-bonding role of the d(sigma) and d(delta) functions. This
   sequence mirrors that in the electronically related dichloride molecules
   and leads to similarities in the periodic trends with those in the
   solids. Systematic errors in the calculated bond energies and
   vibrational frequencies are identified. The successful use of a
   correctly parameterized ligand-field model is reported allowing
   quantitative reproduction of the `d-d' spectra of the monoxide molecules

   At low laser fluence, the major photofragmentation channel observed is
   the loss of O-2 or consecutive O-2 units from clusters that are oxygen
   rich. When the laser fluence is increased, additional fragmentation
   channels are observed. The majority of the clusters investigated, from

Abstract = {We report on a photoelectron spectroscopic study of monovanadium oxides,

   Vibrationally resolved spectra are obtained for VO- at 532 and 355 nm
   detachment photon energies. Two new low-lying excited states are
   observed for VO at 5630 and 14 920 cm(-1) above the ground state. These
   states are assigned to two doublet states, (2) Sigma(-) and (2) Phi,
   respectively. The 532 and 355 nm spectra of VO2- reveal a single
   vibrational progression for the ground state with a frequency of 970
   cm(-1) (nu(1)). Three electronic excited states are observed for VO2 in
   the 193 nm spectrum. For VO3-, three surprisingly sharp detachment
   transitions are observed at 193 nm, The two excited states of VO3 are
   measured to be 0.59 and 0.79 eV above the ground state. The spectra of
   VO2- and VO3 are interpreted using the molecular-orbital schemes
   obtained in a recent ab initio theoretical study {[}Knight, Jr, et al.,
   J. Chem. Phys. 105, 10237 (1996)], which predicts that both VO2 and VO3
   neutrals are of C-2 upsilon symmetry with a doublet ground state. The

   of VO;, but much more broadened, The adiabatic electron affinities of

Abstract = {The first spectroscopic characterization of the VO2 radical is reported
   along with new results for (VO)-O-17 and tentative assignments for the
   VO3 and V-2(+) radicals. These vanadium radicals were investigated in
   neon matrices at 4 K by electron spin resonance utilizing conventional
   high temperature vaporization and pulsed laser ablation generation
   methods. A detailed ESR study of VO, showed it to be nonlinear with a
   (2)A(1) ground state; the g tensor analysis reveals the presence of an
   excited electronic state (B-2(1)) approximately 1 eV above the ground
   state. This excited state prediction and the observed nuclear hyperfine
   interactions (A tensors) for V-51 and O-17 were compared with
   theoretical results obtained from various ab initio computational
   methods. Ab initio calculations with an extended basis set were
   performed at various levels of theory including UHF, ROHF, CAS-SCF, and
   MR-SDCI (multireference single and double configuration interaction).
   While UHF calculations of the hyperfine interaction were grossly in
   error, the better levels of theory gave qualitative agreement with
   experiment and provided an aid to interpretation. VO2 is predicted to be
   a bent (2)A(1) state, correlating with the linear (2) Delta
   configuration having the odd electron predominantly in the V 3d orbital.
   VO3 is predicted to be planar C-2 upsilon, with the odd electron in a
   b(2) orbital localized in the oxygen in-plane n-type p orbitals. (C)

Abstract = {The ground and selected low-lying electronic states of the entire series
   of the first-row transition-metal neutral oxides are investigated by the
   use of an improved atom superposition and electron delocalization
   molecular orbital (ASED-MO) approach. Two quantities are found to be
   very important in achieving agreement with experiment: these are the
   (kappa,delta) parameter set - involved in the Wolfsberg-Helmholz
   constant, K - and the charge dependent Slater-type orbital exponents.
   For SeO through CrO the optimum (kappa,delta) set of (0.87, 0.24
   Angstrom(-1)) yields ground states and spectroscopic constants (R(e),
   D-0, omega(e) and mu) in good agreement with experiment. The set (1.00,
   0.35 Angstrom(-1)) works well for MnO to CuO and (0.75, 0.13
   Angstrom(-1)) for ZnO. Calculations are consistent with both ionic and
   covalent bonding contributions in the monoxides. The M-O bond strengths
   exhibit the `'double humped'' shape, characteristic of many periodic
   properties of the transition metals. Moreover, the sharp contrast in the
   calculated bond energies between the early and late transition-metal
   oxides accounts well for the pronounced differences in their
   reactivities.},

Title = {ROTATIONAL AND HYPERFINE-STRUCTURE IN THE B(4)PI-X(4)SIGMA(-) (0,0) BAND
   OF VO AT 7900 ANGSTROM - PERTURBATIONS BY THE A(2)SIGMA(+), V=2 LEVEL},

Abstract = {The (0,0) band of the (BII)-I-4-X(4) Sigma(-) system of VO near 7900
   Angstrom has been analyzed from Doppler-limited Fourier transform
   emission spectra, together with wavelength-resolved laser-induced
   fluorescence and sub-Doppler intermodulated fluorescence spectra. The
   (BII)-I-4, v = 0 level is heavily perturbed by the a(2) Sigma(+), v = 2
   level. Because the 3d delta(2) 4s sigma a(2) Sigma(+) and 3d delta(2) 3d
   pi B4II states have very different hyperfine parameters, the hyperfine
   patterns of the rotational lines vary dramatically with J at the
   perturbations. The observed hyperfine structure of the band, including
   the lowest-J perturbation, near J = 381/2, could be explained in detail
   by a model Hamiltonian that takes the interactions into account: 3211
   hyperfine line frequencies have been fitted with an rms error of 11 MHz.
   The b parameter (the coefficient of I.S in the magnetic hyperfine
   Hamiltonian) is well determined for the a(2) Sigma(+) state and provides
   the evidence for its electron configuration. The hyperfine structure of
   the (BII)-I-4 state shows no effects of spin-orbit distortion and is
   well explained by the standard case (a(beta J)) model. Only the
   spin-orbit operator is needed to describe the interaction between the a
   and B states; the parameter for the direct dipolar interaction between
   them is too small to be determined. A fit to the higher-J rotational
   data showed that the spin-orbit interaction matrix element, which arises
   as a result of configuration interaction in the two states, has an
   apparent J dependence; this presumably means that the mixing is r
   dependent, Improved values for the ground state hyperfine parameters
   have been obtained from the new data, supplemented by the three very
   precise microwave frequencies measured by Suenram el al. (J. Mel.
   Spectrosc. 148, 114, 1991). (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {The first transition row oxides and sulfides are studied using several
   different levels of theory. The calculations show the bonding mechanism
   in the sulfides and oxides to be very similar. For the oxides, accurate
   experimental data anew the theoretical methods to be calibrated. The
   same level of theory is used to study the sulfides where there is far
   less experimental information. For ScO through MnO and CuO the coupled
   cluster singles and doubles technique including a perturbational
   estimate of the connected triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)] yields
   spectroscopic constants (r(c), omega(c), and D-o) in good agreement with
   experiment. The triple excitations are found to be very important in
   achieving this accuracy. For FeO to NiO, the self-consistent-field (SCF)
   approach yields pi. orbitals that are localized on the metal or oxygen.
   This appears to cause problems for the single reference techniques; this
   is discussed in detail for NiO. The complete-active-space SCF/internally
   contracted averaged coupled pair functional approach (CASSCF/ICACPF)
   works well for FeO to NiO. The calculation of accurate dipole moments is
   found to be very difficult.},
