abstract = {Abstract A new room temperature line list for 15NH3 is presented. This line list comprised of transition frequencies and Einstein coefficients has been generated using the ‘spectroscopic’ potential energy surface NH3-Y2010 and an ab initio dipole moment surface. The 15NH3 line list is based on the same computational procedure used for the line list for 14NH3 \{BYTe\} reported recently and should be as accurate. Comparisons with experimental frequencies and intensities are presented. The synthetic spectra show excellent agreement with experimental spectra. }

Abstract = {{(NH3)-N-15 is the object of extensive investigation due to the central
   role of ammonia in astronomical sciences and to the complexity of
   modeling its interacting vibrationally excited states. Of major interest
   in astrochemistry is the determination of the N-14/N-15 ratio in space,
   characterized by unexpected variability among different solar system
   objects and reservoirs. Recently, the spectroscopic analysis of ground
   and v(2) = 1 a, s states of (NH3)-N-15 has been completed at
   experimental accuracy. Here, the characterization of the a, s inversion
   symmetry levels of v(2) = 1, 2 and v(4) = 1 states is presented. New
   spectra of (NH3)-N-15 have been recorded from 325 to 2000 cm(-1) at a
   resolution ranging from 0.00096 cm(-1) to 0.003 cm(-1), using the
   Canadian Light Source synchrotron at CLS. 7518 transitions covering nine
   bands, V-2, 2V(2), V-4, 2V(2) VV2, V-4 VV2, 2v(2) <-> V-4 and the
   inversion-rotation transitions in the excited states, have been fitted
   simultaneously. The effective Hamiltonian adopted includes all symmetry
   allowed interactions between and within the studied excited states,
   according to the most recent results on ammonia. The transitions have
   been reproduced at experimental accuracy using 185 spectroscopic
   parameters, determined with high precision. The leading diagonal
   parameters, Gv, B, C, D's, compare well with those of (NH3)-N-14. The
   wavenumbers of the assigned transitions are compared with their
   theoretically predicted values. An improved set of ground state
   parameters is also derived. These results noticeably improve the
   wavenumber line list in the high-resolution transmission molecular
   absorption (HITRAN) database.}},

abstract = {Abstract The Texas Echelon cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES), mounted on NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF),
was used to map mid-infrared ammonia absorption features on both Jupiter and Saturn in February 2013.
Ammonia is the principle reservoir of nitrogen on the giant planets, and the ratio of isotopologues ( 15 N/ 14 N)
can reveal insights into the molecular carrier (e.g., as \{N2\} or NH3) of nitrogen to the forming protoplanets,
and hence the source reservoirs from which these worlds accreted. We targeted two spectral intervals (900 and 960 cm-1)
 that were relatively clear of terrestrial atmospheric contamination and contained close features of 14 \{NH3\} and 15 NH3,
allowing us to derive the ratio from a single spectrum without ambiguity due to radiometric calibration
(the primary source of uncertainty in this study). We present the first ground-based determination of Jupiterâ 15 N/ 14 N
ratio (in the range from 1.4 Ã— 10 - 3 to 2.5 Ã— 10 - 3 ), which is consistent with both previous space-based studies
and with the primordial value of the protosolar nebula. On Saturn, we present the first upper limit on the 15 N/ 14 N
ratio of no larger than 2.0 Ã— 10 - 3 for the 900-cm-1 channel and a less stringent requirement that the ratio be no
larger than 2.8 Ã— 10 - 3 for the 960-cmâˆ’1 channel ( 1 Ïƒ confidence). Specifically, the data rule out
strong 15 N-enrichments such as those observed in Titanâ€™s atmosphere and in cometary nitrogen compounds.
To the extent possible with ground-based radiometric uncertainties, the saturnian and jovian 15 N/ 14 N ratios
appear indistinguishable, implying that 15 N-enriched ammonia ices could not have been a substantial
contributor to the bulk nitrogen inventory of either planet. This result favours accretion of primordial
\{N2\} on both planets, either in the gas phase from the solar nebula, or as ices formed at very low temperatures.
Finally, spatially-resolved \{TEXES\} observations are used to derive zonal contrasts in tropospheric temperatures,
phosphine and 14 \{NH3\} on both planets, allowing us to relate thermal conditions and chemical compositions
to phenomena observed at visible wavelengths in 2013 (e.g., Jupiterâ€™s faint equatorial red colouration event
and wave activity in the equatorial belts, plus the remnant warm band on Saturn following the 2010 springtime storm). }

   Methods. With the IRAM-30m telescope, we obtained deep integrations of

   imaging spectrometer covering the wavelength range 0.3-5.2 mum in 352
   spectral channels, with a nominal instantaneous field of view of 0.5
   mrad. The Cassini flyby of Jupiter represented a unique opportunity to
   accomplish two important goals: scientific observations of the jovian
   system and functional tests of the VIMS instrument under conditions
   similar to those expected to obtain during Cassini's 4-year tour of the
   saturnian system. Results acquired over a complete range of visual to
   near-infrared wavelengths from 0.3 to 5.2 mum are presented. First
   detections include methane fluorescence on Jupiter, a surprisingly high
   opposition surge on Europa, the first visual-near-IR spectra of Himalia
   and Jupiter's optically-thin ring system, and the first near-infrared
   observations of the rings over an extensive range of phase angles
   (0-120degrees). Similarities in the center-to-limb profiles of H-3(+)
   and CH4 emissions indicate that the H-3(+) ionospheric density is
   solar-controlled outside of the auroral regions. The existence of jovian
   NH3 absorption at 0.93 mum is confirmed. Himalia has a slightly reddish
   spectrum, an apparent absorption near 3 mum, and a geometric albedo of
   0.06+/-0.01 at 2.2 mum (assuming an 85-km radius). If the 3-mum feature
   in Himalia's spectrum is eventually confirmed, it would be suggestive of
   the presence of water in some form, either free, bound, or incorporated
   in layer-lattice silicates. Finally, a mean ring-particle radius of 10
   mum is found to be consistent with Mie-scattering models fit to VIMS
   near-infrared observations acquired over 0-120degrees phase angle. (C)

	Spectrometer (ISO-SWS) observations of Jupiter related to ammonia.
	We focus on two spectral regions; the first one (the 10-mu m region),
	ranging from 9.5 to 11.5 mu m, probes atmospheric levels between
	1 and 0.2 bar, while the second one (the 5-mu m window), ranging
	from 4.8 to 5.5 mu m, sounds the atmosphere between 8 and 2 bar.
	The two spectral windows cannot be fitted with the same ammonia vertical
	distribution. From the 10-mu m region we infer an ammonia distribution
	of about half the saturation profile above the 1-bar level, where
	the N/H ratio is roughly solar. A totally different picture is derived
	from the 5-mu m window, where we determine an upper limit of 3.7
	x 10(-5) at 1 bar and find an increasing NH(3) abundance at least
	down to 4 bar. This profile is similar to that measured by the Galileo
	probe. The discrepancy between the two spectral regions most likely
	arises from the spatial heterogeneity of Jupiter, the 5-mu m window
	sounding dry areas unveiled by a locally thin cloud cover (the 5-mu
	m hot spots), and the 10-mu m region probing the mean jovian atmosphere
	above 1 bar. The (15)NH(3) mixing ratio is measured around 400 mbar

	= (1.9(-1.0)(+0.9)) X 10(-3), while ((15)N/(14)N)(+) = 3.68 X 10(-3)].
	It is not clear whether this depletion reveals the global jovian
	(15)N/(14)N ratio. Instead an isotopic fractionation process, taking
	place during the ammonia cloud condensation, is indicated as a possible
	mechanism. A fractionation coefficient alpha higher than 1.08 would
	explain the observed isotopic ratio, but the lack of laboratory data
	does not allow us to decide unambiguously on the origin of the observed
	low (15)N/(14)N ratio. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

	CO2 laser and a pulsed ultraviolet (UV) laser system. Infrared radiation
	was used to prepare molecules in individual rotational levels of
	the upsilon(2) = 1 vibrational state of the electronic ground state
	of {[}N-15]ammonia. These molecules were then photoionized via transitions
	of the (\$) over tilde C-(\$) over tilde X band in a (2 + 1) process
	using the doubled output of a pulsed dye laser. The ion signal was
	detected using a time of flight mass spectrometer. Two known coincidences
	between CO2 laser lines and individual rovibrational transitions
	of (NH3)-N-15 were used to populate the (J, K) = (5, 4) and (3, 0)
	symmetric levels of upsilon(2) = 1. Double resonance signals corresponding
	to O, P, Q, R, and S branch two photon transitions in the (\$) over
	tilde C'-(\$) over tilde X band were observed and measured accurately.
	These data were augmented by conventional (2 + 1) REMPI measurements
	on the 2(0)(0), 2(0)(1), and 2(0)(2) sub-bands of (NH3)-N-15. A complete
	set of molecular parameters for the upsilon(2) = 0, 1, and 2 levels
	of the (\$) over tilde C' state was calculated from these data. The
	results represent the most detailed information so far produced over
	the (\$) over tilde C' state of ammonia. The relevance of these experiments
	for the investigation of molecular clusters produced in a free expansion
	jet is discussed.},

	with water. It is possible that the nitrogen-containing species is
	an NH group. With V2O5/TiO2 the only remaining product is (NNO)-N-14-N-15.
	However, this is largely replaced by doubly labeled products, N-14(2),
	N-15(2), and (N2O)-N-15, when using alpha-Cr2O3.},

	against the ultracompact HII region, as are the highly excited (NH3)-N-14
	lines, the (NH3)-N-15 (4,3) and (4,4) lines are seen in weak emission.
	It is argued that the (4,3) and (4,4) lines must be weak masers amplifying
	the continuum of the UCHII region. The well studied (NH3)-N-15(3,3)
	maser was remeasured and does not appear to vary on a timescale of
	years. We report sensitive upper limits to the (7,7) and several
	non-metastable lines of (NH3)-N-15. The existence of the (4,3) and
	(4,4) masers is a challenge to the usual NH3 maser pumping models
	since such models do not allow simultaneous masing of the (4,3) and
	the (3,3) line and do not predict (4,4) masing. We investigate the
	question if it is possible to explain all masers in the frame of
	the current model or if it has to be extended. One possible explanation
	of the observations would be the pumping of the maser by 10-mu-m
	continuum radiation via the v2 = 1 level. This is not totally ad
	hoc because vibrationally excited ammonia has been detected in NGC
	7538 by Schilke et al. (1990a).},
