The ground X9Σ−g and the first excited 7Σ−u states have been detailed by a multitude of plain and explicitly correlated F12 methods at both the valence and core-valence computational levels. The potential curves of most of the states present strong interactions/avoided crossings that trigger a severe non adiabatic behavior.

	Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of 59 Ω states generated from the 17 Λ-S states (X1Σ+, a3Σ +, 15Σ+, b3Δ, c 3Π, 15Π, 25Σ+, 2 3Δ, 23Π, 33Σ+, A 1Π, 23Σ+, 35Σ +, 17Σ+, 15Δ, 2 5Δ, and 25Π) of AsP molecule are studied for the first time for internuclear separations from about 0.10 to 1.10 nm. All the Λ-S states are contributed to the first three dissociation channels of AsP molecule except for the A1Π. The 23Σ +, 35Σ+, 17Σ +, 15Δ, 25Δ, and 25Π are found to be the repulsive states. The a3Σ+, 15Π, b3Δ, 17Σ+, 15Δ, 25Δ, and 25Π are found to be the inverted states. Each of the 33Σ+, c 3Π, 23Π, 15Π, and 1 5Σ+ states has one potential barrier. The PECs are calculated by the CASSCF method, which is followed by the internally contracted MRCI approach with Davidson correction. Core-valence correlation and scalar relativistic corrections are included. The convergent behavior of present calculations is discussed with respect to the basis set and level of theory. The spin-orbit coupling effect is accounted for. All these PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The spectroscopic parameters are evaluated for the bound states involved, and are compared with available measurements. Excellent agreement has been found between the present results and the measurements. It shows that the spectroscopic parameters reported in this paper can be expected to be reliably predicted ones. The conclusion is gained that the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the spectroscopic parameters is not obvious for all the Λ-S bound states except for few ones such as 1 5Σ+ and c3Π. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For the two lowest quartet states (X 4Σ− and A 4Π), a focal point analysis (FPA) approach was used that conjoined a correlation-consistent family of basis sets up to aug-cc-pwCV5Z-DK with high-order coupled cluster theory through pentuple (CCSDTQP) excitations. FPA adiabatic excitation energies (T 0) and spectroscopic constants (r e, r 0, B e, B 0, D⎯⎯⎯ e, H e, ω e, v 0, α e, ω e x e) were extrapolated to the valence complete basis set Douglas-Kroll (DK) aug-cc-pV∞Z-DK CCSDT level of theory, and additional treatments accounted for higher-order valence electron correlation, core correlation, and spin-orbit coupling. Due to the delicate interplay between dynamical and static electronic correlation, single reference coupled cluster theory is able to provide the correct ground electronic state (X 4Σ−), while multireference configuration interaction theory cannot. Perturbations from the first- and second-order spin orbit coupling of low-lying states with quartet spin multiplicity reveal an immensely complex rotational spectrum relative to the isovalent species VO, VS, and TiCl. Computational data on the doublet manifold suggest that the lowest-lying doublet state (2Γ) has a T e of ∼11 200 cm−1. Overall, this study shows that laboratory and theoretical rotational spectroscopists must work more closely in tandem to better understand the bonding and structure of molecules containing transition metals.},

Adiabatic excitation energies (T 0) and spectroscopic constants (r e, r 0, B e, B 0, D⎯⎯⎯ e, ω e, v 0, α e, ω e x e) were extrapolated to the valence complete basis set Douglas-Kroll (DK) aug-cc-pwCV∞Z-DK CCSDT level of theory, and additional treatments accounted for higher-order valence electron correlation, core correlation, spin-orbit coupling, and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. The purely ab initio FPA approach yields the following T 0 results (in eV) for the lowest spin-orbit components of each electronic state: 0 (X  4Δ) < 0.132 (A  4Π) < 0.190 (a  6Δ) < 0.444 (b  6Π). The computed anharmonic fundamental vibrational frequencies (v 0) for the 4,6Δ electronic states are within 3 cm−1 of experiment and provide reliable predictions for the 4,6Π states. With the cc-pVDZ basis set, even CCSDTQPH energies give an incorrect ground state of FeH, highlighting the importance of combining high-order electron correlation treatments with robust basis sets when studying transition-metal radicals. The FPA computations provide D 0 = 1.86 eV (42.9 kcal mol−1) for the 0 K dissociation energy of FeH and ΔfH∘298 [FeH(g)] = 107.7 kcal mol−1 for the enthalpy of formation at room temperature. Despite sizable multireference character in the quartet states, high-order single-reference coupled cluster computations improve the spectroscopic parameters over previous multireference theoretical studies; for example, the X  4Δ → A  4Π and a  6Δ → b  6Π transition energies are reproduced to 0.012 and 0.002 eV, respectively, while the error for the problematic X  4Δ → a  6Δ intercombination excitation is reduced from at least 0.17 eV to about 0.04 eV.},

Rotationally resolved spectroscopy has established a ground statebond length of 1.7024(3) {\AA}, quite similar to that found for Cr2 (r0 = 1.6858 {\AA}).

	Abstract = {
The problem of calculation of the electronic structure of transition-metal clusters (even dimers) still presents a challenge for computational chemistry. The reason is that the expansion of the ground state wave function on electronic configurations does not contain a principal configuration and a large number of reference configurations must be treated equally. Thus the multireference (MR) approaches are, in general, mandatory.

According to our studies of Mn2 by the MRCISD(+Q)/aug-cc-pVQZ and ACPF approaches, the ground state is the singlet, X1Σ+g, with the binding energy D e = 1.7 kcal/mol (0.07 eV) and R e = 3.6 {\AA}. It was proved that the binding in the Mn2 dimer is of the van der Waals type. The calculation of Sc2 at the MRCISD(+Q)/cc-pV5Z level, showed that its ground state corresponds to a quintet, 5Σ−u, in agreement with experiment and previous precise calculations. The triplet 3Σ−u state is located about 1.1 kcal/mol above. The ground state, X5Σ−u, of the Sc2 dimer was calculated by the MRCISD(+Q) method at the complete basis set (CBS) limit. This is the first MRCISD(+Q) calculation of 3d transition-metal clusters at the CBS limit. From the Mulliken population analysis and comparison with atomic energies follows that in the ground state Sc2 dissociates on one Sc in the ground state and the other in the second excited quartet state, 4Fu. The spectroscopic parameters of the ground potential curve, obtained by the Dunham analysis at the valence MRCISD(+Q)/CBS level, are: R e = 5.20 bohr, D e = 50.37 kcal/mol, and ω e = 234.5 cm−1. The obtained value for the harmonic frequency agrees very well with the experimental one, ω e = 239.9 cm−1. The Sc2 dimer is stabilized by the covalent bonding on the hybrid atomic orbitals.

Here, we investigate the binding energy, geometry, electronic structure, and potential energy curves for diatomic TM carbides using several exchange-correlation functionals. The functionals that include explicit dependence on the kinetic energy density (τ-functionals) are considered, among others. We have found M05-2x performance to be the best, followed by BMK, when compared with experimental and high level WFT energetics.

The effects on the spectroscopic parameters by the core--valence correlation, relativistic and nonadiabatic corrections have been discussed in detail. The core--valence correlation correction is carried out at the aug-cc-pCVTZ basis set. The nonadiabatic correction is performed at the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. And the relativistic correction is made at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. The way to consider the relativistic correction is to employ the second-order Douglas--Kroll Hamiltonian (DKH2) approximation. To obtain more reliable PECs, the Davidson modification is also included in the present study. To reduce the incomplete basis set error, the \{PECs\} of these electronic states are extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. With these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters of these low-lying electronic states are determined. On the one hand, analyses demonstrate that the effects on the spectroscopic parameters by the core--valence correlation correction, relativistic correction and Davidson modification are very obvious, whereas the effect on the spectroscopic parameters by the nonadiabatic correction is very small. On the other hand, comparison with the \{RKR\} data shows that the two-point total-energy extrapolation could improve the quality of spectroscopic parameters. On the whole, as expected, the most accurate spectroscopic parameters of GeS molecule are determined by the MRCI+Q/CV+DK+Q5 calculations. },

@article{06Raxxxx.Re,
	Abstract = {A comprehensive analysis on the successes and failures of the theoretical spectroscopy of copper and silver monohalides is presented in light of the recent theoretical versus experimental information for these systems. It is shown that although for copper monohalides the standard quantum chemical multireference SCF, perturbational or CI approaches work well to describe their spectroscopy, for their silver counterparts this is not the case always. While density functional theory is intrinsically unable to deal with the most intense transition (B1∑+-X1∑+) observed in the whole CuX and AgX series, the CASSCF+CASPT2 method fails for the AgX family is describing this excitation, even with the largest physically meaningful valence orbital active space. The complexity of silver halides arises from the concatenation of three independent problems: first, the isolated atom spectroscopy is much more complex for Ag than for Cu, since for silver the Rydberg 2P(4d 105p 1) state lies close but below the valence 2 D(4d 95s 2) one; secondly, the spin-orbit coupling for silver is much larger and thus the fine-structure components of these doublets are intertwined, leading to very large ΛS∑ mixing effects in the molecular case. Finally, rather strong interactions exist between the numerous Ag(4d 95s 2)X(np 5) and Ag(4d 105p 1)X(np 5) neutral configurations with the Ag+(4d 95s1)X -(np 6) ionic structures, making the accurate description of these mixtures an extremely difficult task, especially for the second 1∑+ state, where even large CASSCF calculations fail at providing continuous state-specific potential energy curves. This remains a true theoretical impasse related to the still unsolved and complex convergence for the coupled CI-orbital multivariate minimization problem. Therefore, it is only possible to properly describe the electronic structure of the excited states of silver monohalides using the full valence active space, to perform variational treatments of the non-dynamic and dynamic electronic correlation treatments with especially optimized and extended RECP-basis sets; then the spin-orbit effects must imperatively be taken into account to qualitatively explain the nature of the observed AgX spectra. However, non-negligible errors are found for some of the basic spectroscopic quantities such as transition energies and vibrational frequencies for the most spectroscopically active excited states.},

	Abstract = {In the present work, all-electron ab initio multi-configuration self-consistent-field (CASSCF) and multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations have been carried out to determine the low-lying electronic states of the molecule RhN. In addition, the relativistic corrections for the one-electron Darwin contact term and the relativistic mass-velocity correction have been determined in perturbation calculations. The spectroscopic constants for the seven low-lying electronic states have been derived by solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the nuclear motion numerically. The predicted ground state of RhN is 1∑+, and this state is separated from the states 3Π, 1Π, 5Δ, 3∑−, 3Δ and 1Δ by transition energies of 1833, 4278, 6579, 8042, 9632, and 13886 cm−1, respectively. For the 1∑+ ground state, the equilibrium distance has been determined as 1.640 {\AA}, and the vibrational frequency as 846 cm−1. The chemical bond in the 1∑+ electronic ground state has triple bond character due to the formation of delocalized bonding π and σ orbitals. The chemical bond in the RhN molecule is polar with charge transfer from Rh to N giving rise to a dipole moment of 2.08 Debye at 3.1 a.u. in the 1∑+ ground state. An approximate treatment of the spin-orbit coupling effect shows that the lowest-lying spin-orbit coupled state is 0+. This state is essentially derived from the 1∑+ ground state. The second and third state, 0+ and 0−, mainly arise from the 3Π state. The dissociation energy of the RhN molecule in its 1∑+ ground state has been derived as 1.74 eV. },

	Abstract = {Ab initio multireference configuration-interaction (MRCI) calculations using localized molecular orbitals (LMO) were made to estimate adiabatic purely electronic transition energies of the six lowest excited states (a 3Σ+, A 3Π, B 1Σ+, C 1Π, E 1Δ) to the X 1Σ+ ground state of the CuF molecule. Spectroscopic constants for these states arefound to be in very good agreement with experimental data and are also reported. Results show again the very strong ionic character of the wavefunctions for all the studied states and that the excited states arise from the Cu+ 3D(d9s1) F− 1S(s2p6) and Cu+ 1D(d9s configurations. },
