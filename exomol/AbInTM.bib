	Abstract = {The CrB+ cation molecular system has been investigated with the help of semi-quantitative basis sets [(7s6p4d3f)Cr/(4s3p2d1f)B] and highly correlated (valence) multi-reference wave functions. Out of a possible manifold of 70 states correlating to the Cr+(6S,6D, 4D, 4G)+B(2P) atomic states, we have explored a total of 35 states spanning an energy range of about 3.4 eV. The ground state is of X 7Sigma+ symmetry with a binding energy of 28.8 kcal/mol at an internuclear distance of 2.242 {\AA}. The next three excited states 1 5Sigma+, 2 5Pi, and 37Pi with energy splittings 7.1, 12.9, and 24.3 kcal/mol from the X state, have binding energies of 21.8, 16.5, and 5.1 kcal/mol, respectively. For practically all states we report potential energy curves, total energies, the most common spectroscopic parameters, while we discuss the binding modes using simple chemical diagrams based on valence-bond concepts. },

	Abstract = {A comprehensive analysis on the successes and failures of the theoretical spectroscopy of copper and silver monohalides is presented in light of the recent theoretical versus experimental information for these systems. It is shown that although for copper monohalides the standard quantum chemical multireference SCF, perturbational or CI approaches work well to describe their spectroscopy, for their silver counterparts this is not the case always. While density functional theory is intrinsically unable to deal with the most intense transition (B1∑+-X1∑+) observed in the whole CuX and AgX series, the CASSCF+CASPT2 method fails for the AgX family is describing this excitation, even with the largest physically meaningful valence orbital active space. The complexity of silver halides arises from the concatenation of three independent problems: first, the isolated atom spectroscopy is much more complex for Ag than for Cu, since for silver the Rydberg 2P(4d 105p 1) state lies close but below the valence 2 D(4d 95s 2) one; secondly, the spin-orbit coupling for silver is much larger and thus the fine-structure components of these doublets are intertwined, leading to very large ΛS∑ mixing effects in the molecular case. Finally, rather strong interactions exist between the numerous Ag(4d 95s 2)X(np 5) and Ag(4d 105p 1)X(np 5) neutral configurations with the Ag+(4d 95s1)X -(np 6) ionic structures, making the accurate description of these mixtures an extremely difficult task, especially for the second 1∑+ state, where even large CASSCF calculations fail at providing continuous state-specific potential energy curves. This remains a true theoretical impasse related to the still unsolved and complex convergence for the coupled CI-orbital multivariate minimization problem. Therefore, it is only possible to properly describe the electronic structure of the excited states of silver monohalides using the full valence active space, to perform variational treatments of the non-dynamic and dynamic electronic correlation treatments with especially optimized and extended RECP-basis sets; then the spin-orbit effects must imperatively be taken into account to qualitatively explain the nature of the observed AgX spectra. However, non-negligible errors are found for some of the basic spectroscopic quantities such as transition energies and vibrational frequencies for the most spectroscopically active excited states.},

Their existences are related to the charge transfer process between the two ionic systems Na+Rb and NaRb+. The accurate potential energy curves have been exploited to realize a long-range vibrational level spacing analysis using the \{WKB\} semi-classical approximation in order to extract the Na and Rb atomic static dipole polarizabilities.

	Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of six low-lying electronic states (X1Σ+, a3Σ+, b3Π, A1Π, 13Σ− and 15Σ+) of GeS molecule have been investigated employing the full valence complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) method followed by the highly accurate valence internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach with large correlation-consistent basis sets for internuclear separations from 0.08 to 2.00&#xa0;nm. The effects on the spectroscopic parameters by the core--valence correlation, relativistic and nonadiabatic corrections have been discussed in detail. The core--valence correlation correction is carried out at the aug-cc-pCVTZ basis set. The nonadiabatic correction is performed at the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. And the relativistic correction is made at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. The way to consider the relativistic correction is to employ the second-order Douglas--Kroll Hamiltonian (DKH2) approximation. To obtain more reliable PECs, the Davidson modification is also included in the present study. To reduce the incomplete basis set error, the \{PECs\} of these electronic states are extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. With these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters of these low-lying electronic states are determined. On the one hand, analyses demonstrate that the effects on the spectroscopic parameters by the core--valence correlation correction, relativistic correction and Davidson modification are very obvious, whereas the effect on the spectroscopic parameters by the nonadiabatic correction is very small. On the other hand, comparison with the \{RKR\} data shows that the two-point total-energy extrapolation could improve the quality of spectroscopic parameters. On the whole, as expected, the most accurate spectroscopic parameters of GeS molecule are determined by the MRCI+Q/CV+DK+Q5 calculations. },

The chemical bond in the RhN molecule is polar with charge transfer from Rh to N giving rise to a dipole moment of 2.08 Debye at 3.1 a.u. in the 1∑+ ground state. An approximate treatment of the spin-orbit coupling effect shows that the lowest-lying spin-orbit coupled state is 0+. This state is essentially derived from the 1∑+ ground state. The second and third state, 0+ and 0−, mainly arise from the 3Π state. The dissociation energy of the RhN molecule in its 1∑+ ground state has been derived as 1.74 eV. },

	Abstract = {
The problem of calculation of the electronic structure of transition-metal clusters (even dimers) still presents a challenge for computational chemistry. The reason is that the expansion of the ground state wave function on electronic configurations does not contain a principal configuration and a large number of reference configurations must be treated equally. Thus the multireference (MR) approaches are, in general, mandatory.

According to our studies of Mn2 by the MRCISD(+Q)/aug-cc-pVQZ and ACPF approaches, the ground state is the singlet, X1Σ+g, with the binding energy D e = 1.7 kcal/mol (0.07 eV) and R e = 3.6 {\AA}. It was proved that the binding in the Mn2 dimer is of the van der Waals type. The calculation of Sc2 at the MRCISD(+Q)/cc-pV5Z level, showed that its ground state corresponds to a quintet, 5Σ−u, in agreement with experiment and previous precise calculations. The triplet 3Σ−u state is located about 1.1 kcal/mol above. The ground state, X5Σ−u, of the Sc2 dimer was calculated by the MRCISD(+Q) method at the complete basis set (CBS) limit. This is the first MRCISD(+Q) calculation of 3d transition-metal clusters at the CBS limit. From the Mulliken population analysis and comparison with atomic energies follows that in the ground state Sc2 dissociates on one Sc in the ground state and the other in the second excited quartet state, 4Fu. The spectroscopic parameters of the ground potential curve, obtained by the Dunham analysis at the valence MRCISD(+Q)/CBS level, are: R e = 5.20 bohr, D e = 50.37 kcal/mol, and ω e = 234.5 cm−1. The obtained value for the harmonic frequency agrees very well with the experimental one, ω e = 239.9 cm−1. The Sc2 dimer is stabilized by the covalent bonding on the hybrid atomic orbitals.

In our previous report [Goel and Masunov, J Chem Phys, 129, 214302, 2008], we studied TM hydrides and found that Boese--Martin functional for kinetics (BMK) combined with broken symmetry approach described dissociation process more accurately than multireference wavefunction theory (WFT) methods and some other functionals. Here, we investigate the binding energy, geometry, electronic structure, and potential energy curves for diatomic TM carbides using several exchange-correlation functionals. The functionals that include explicit dependence on the kinetic energy density (τ-functionals) are considered, among others. We have found M05-2x performance to be the best, followed by BMK, when compared with experimental and high level WFT energetics. This agreement deteriorates quickly for other functionals when the fraction of the Hartree--Fock exchange is decreased.

Adiabatic excitation energies (T 0) and spectroscopic constants (r e, r 0, B e, B 0, D⎯⎯⎯ e, ω e, v 0, α e, ω e x e) were extrapolated to the valence complete basis set Douglas-Kroll (DK) aug-cc-pwCV∞Z-DK CCSDT level of theory, and additional treatments accounted for higher-order valence electron correlation, core correlation, spin-orbit coupling, and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. The purely ab initio FPA approach yields the following T 0 results (in eV) for the lowest spin-orbit components of each electronic state: 0 (X  4Δ) < 0.132 (A  4Π) < 0.190 (a  6Δ) < 0.444 (b  6Π). The computed anharmonic fundamental vibrational frequencies (v 0) for the 4,6Δ electronic states are within 3 cm−1 of experiment and provide reliable predictions for the 4,6Π states.

FPA adiabatic excitation energies (T 0) and spectroscopic constants (r e, r 0, B e, B 0, D⎯⎯⎯ e, H e, ω e, v 0, α e, ω e x e) were extrapolated to the valence complete basis set Douglas-Kroll (DK) aug-cc-pV∞Z-DK CCSDT level of theory, and additional treatments accounted for higher-order valence electron correlation, core correlation, and spin-orbit coupling. Due to the delicate interplay between dynamical and static electronic correlation, single reference coupled cluster theory is able to provide the correct ground electronic state (X 4Σ−), while multireference configuration interaction theory cannot. Perturbations from the first- and second-order spin orbit coupling of low-lying states with quartet spin multiplicity reveal an immensely complex rotational spectrum relative to the isovalent species VO, VS, and TiCl. Computational data on the doublet manifold suggest that the lowest-lying doublet state (2Γ) has a T e of ∼11 200 cm−1. Overall, this study shows that laboratory and theoretical rotational spectroscopists must work more closely in tandem to better understand the bonding and structure of molecules containing transition metals.},
