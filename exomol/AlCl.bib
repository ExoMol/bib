Title = {{Vibronic spectra of aluminium monochloride relevant to circumstellar
   molecule{*}}},
Journal = {{Chinese Phys. B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Abstract = {{The A(1)pi -> X-1 sigma(+) transition system of aluminium monochloride
   is determined by using ab initio quantum chemistry. Based on the
   multi-reference configuration interaction method in conjugate to the
   Davidson correction (MRCI + Q), the potential energy curves (PECs) of
   the three electronic states are obtained. Transition dipole moments
   (TDMs) and the vibrational energy levels are studied by employing the
   aug-cc-pwCV5Z-DK basis set with 4220-active space. The rovibrational
   constants are first determined from the analytic potential by solving
   the rovibrational Schrodinger equation, and then the spectroscopic
   constants are determined by fitting the vibrational levels, and these
   values are well consistent with the experimental data. The effect of
   spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the spectra and vibrational properties are
   evaluated. The results show that the SOC effect has almost no influence
   on the spectroscopic constants of AlCl molecules. For the A(1)pi -> X-1
   sigma(+) transition, the highly diagonalized Frank-Condon factor (FCF)
   is f(00) = 0.9988. Additionally, Einstein coefficients and radiative
   lifetimes are studied, where the vibrational bands include nu `' = 0-19
   -> nu ` = 0-9. The ro-vibrational intensity is calculated at a
   temperature of 296 K, which can have certain astrophysical applications.
   At present, there is no report on the calculation of AlCl ro-vibrational
   intensity, so we hope that our results will be useful in analyzing the
   interstellar AlCl based on the absorption from A(1)pi -> X-1 sigma(+).}},

	abstract = {The A-X, a-X and b-a systems of AlCl molecule have been photographed under high resolution. The rotational structure in 18 bands of the A-X system involving 0 ⩽ v' ⩽ 10 and 0 ⩽ v" ⩽ 15; in the (0, 0) bands of the a-X system; and in the (0, 0), (0, 1) and (0, 2) bands of the b-a system has been analysed and precise molecular constants for the four states involved in these transitions have been determined. The Λ-doubling in each of the A1Π, a3Π1 and a3Π2 states is found to be negligible as is the spin splitting in the b3Σ+ state. However the a3Π0 state shows appreciable Λ-doubling. Our constants are able to explain several hitherto unexplained features in the structure. The predissociations observed in the v = 9 and 10 levels of the A1Π state lead to a reliable estimate for the dissociation energy of the molecule. Some comments are made regarding the predissociating state.}
