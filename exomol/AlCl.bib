Title = {Molecular abundances in the inner layers of IRC+10216},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {543},
Abstract = {Context. The inner layers of circumstellar envelopes around asymptotic
   giant branch stars are sites where a variety of processes such as
   thermochemical equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation, and
   condensation of dust grains determine the chemical composition of the
   material that is expelled into the outer envelope layers and,
   ultimately, into interstellar space.
   Aims. We aim at studying the abundances, throughout the whole
   circumstellar envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to constrain the different
   processes at work in such regions.
   Methods. Observations towards IRC +10216 of CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl,
   AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope
   in the 80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of rotational
   transitions covering a wide range of energy levels, including highly
   excited vibrational states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer calculations based
   on the LVG formalism have been performed to derive molecular abundances
   from the innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation calculations
   include infrared pumping to excited vibrational states and inelastic
   collisions, for which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational and,
   in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are used.
   Results. We find that in the inner layers CS, SiO, and SiS have
   abundances relative to H-2 of 4 x 10(-6), 1.8 x 10(-7), and 3 x 10(-6),
   respectively, and that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively contribute to the
   formation of dust. Moreover, in the inner layers, the amount of sulfur
   and silicon in gas phase molecules is only 27\% for S and 5.6\% for Si,
   implying that these elements have already condensed onto grains, most
   likely in the form of MgS and SiC. Metal-bearing molecules lock up a
   relatively small fraction of metals, although our results indicate that
   NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their refractory character, are
   not significantly depleted in the cold outer layers. In these regions a
   few percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the gas phase, either
   in atomic or molecular form, and are therefore available to participate
   in the gas phase chemistry in the outer envelope.},

Title = {{Temperature-dependent direct photodissociation cross sections and rates
   of AlCl}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{508}},
Pages = {2848-2854},
Abstract = {{The photodissociation process of aluminium monochloride (AlCl) plays an
   important role in modelling the chemistry of the circumstellar envelope.
   In this work, direct photodissociation cross sections of AlCl have been
   computed for transitions from the ground X-1 Sigma(+) state to six
   low-lying excited electronic states by using ab initio potential energy
   curves and transition dipole moments, which are obtained by the
   internally contracted multireference configuration-interaction method
   with Davidson correction and the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. State-resolved
   cross sections for transitions from 38 958 rovibrational levels (v `' <=
   100, J `' <= 400) of the ground X-1 Sigma(+) state have been obtained
   for photon wavelengths from 500 angstrom to the dissociation threshold.
   Photodissociation cross sections in local thermal equilibrium are
   evaluated for gas temperatures from 500 to 10 000 K. Using the computed
   cross sections, temperature-dependent photodissociation rates of X-1
   Sigma(+) in the interstellar and blackbody radiation fields are
   determined. The results can be applied to the investigation of the
   chemical evolution of Al in the envelope of carbon-rich and oxygen-rich
   stars.}},

Title = {{Vibronic spectra of aluminium monochloride relevant to circumstellar
   molecule{*}}},
Journal = {Chinese Phys. B},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
pages = {033102},
Abstract = {The A(1)pi -> X-1 sigma(+) transition system of aluminium monochloride
   is determined by using ab initio quantum chemistry. Based on the
   multi-reference configuration interaction method in conjugate to the
   Davidson correction (MRCI + Q), the potential energy curves (PECs) of
   the three electronic states are obtained. Transition dipole moments
   (TDMs) and the vibrational energy levels are studied by employing the
   aug-cc-pwCV5Z-DK basis set with 4220-active space. The rovibrational
   constants are first determined from the analytic potential by solving
   the rovibrational Schrodinger equation, and then the spectroscopic
   constants are determined by fitting the vibrational levels, and these
   values are well consistent with the experimental data. The effect of
   spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the spectra and vibrational properties are
   evaluated. The results show that the SOC effect has almost no influence
   on the spectroscopic constants of AlCl molecules. For the A(1)pi -> X-1
   sigma(+) transition, the highly diagonalized Frank-Condon factor (FCF)
   is f(00) = 0.9988. Additionally, Einstein coefficients and radiative
   lifetimes are studied, where the vibrational bands include nu `' = 0-19
   -> nu ` = 0-9. The ro-vibrational intensity is calculated at a
   temperature of 296 K, which can have certain astrophysical applications.
   At present, there is no report on the calculation of AlCl ro-vibrational
   intensity, so we hope that our results will be useful in analyzing the
   interstellar AlCl based on the absorption from A(1)pi -> X-1 sigma(+)},

precise molecular constants for the four states involved in these transitions have
been determined. The Λ-doubling in each of the A1Π, a3Π1 and a3Π2 states is found
to be negligible as is the spin splitting in the b3Σ+ state. However the a3Π0
state shows appreciable Λ-doubling. Our constants are able to explain several
hitherto unexplained features in the structure. The predissociations observed
in the v = 9 and 10 levels of the A1Π state lead to a reliable estimate for the
dissociation energy of the molecule. Some comments are made regarding the
predissociating state.}
