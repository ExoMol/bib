Title = {{ATOMIUM: halide molecules around the S-type AGB star W Aquilae}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {655},
Abstract = {Context. S-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are thought to be
   intermediates in the evolution of oxygen- to carbon-rich AGB stars. The
   chemical compositions of their circumstellar envelopes are also
   intermediate but have not been studied in as much detail as their
   carbon- and oxygen-rich counterparts. W Aql is a nearby S-type star,
   with well-known circumstellar parameters, making it an ideal object for
   in-depth study of less common molecules.
   Aims. We aim to determine the abundances of AlCl and AlF from rotational
   lines, which have been observed for the first time towards an S-type AGB
   star. In combination with models based on PACS observations, we aim to
   update our chemical kinetics network based on these results.
   Methods. We analyse ALMA observations towards W Aql of AlCl in the
   ground and first two vibrationally excited states and AlF in the ground
   vibrational state. Using radiative transfer models, we determine the
   abundances and spatial abundance distributions of (AlCl)-Cl-35,
   (AlCl)-Cl-37, and AlF. We also model HCl and HF emission and compare
   these models to PACS spectra to constrain the abundances of these
   species.
   Results. AlCl is found in clumps very close to the star, with emission
   confined within 0 `'.1 of the star. AlF emission is more extended, with
   faint emission extending 0 `'.2 to 0 `'.6 from the continuum peak. We
   find peak abundances, relative to H-2, of 1.7 x 10(-7) for (AlCl)-Cl-35,
   7 x 10(-8) for (AlCl)-Cl-37, and 1 x 10(-7) for AlF. From the PACS
   spectra, we find abundances of 9.7 x 10(-8) and <= 10(-8), relative to
   H-2, for HCl and HF, respectively.
   Conclusions. The AlF abundance exceeds the solar F abundance, indicating
   that fluorine synthesised in the AGB star has already been dredged up to
   the surface of the star and ejected into the circumstellar envelope.
   From our analysis of chemical reactions in the wind, we conclude that
   AlF may participate in the dust formation process, but we cannot fully
   explain the rapid depletion of AlCl seen in the wind.},

Abstract = {{The photodissociation process of aluminium monochloride (AlCl) plays an
   important role in modelling the chemistry of the circumstellar envelope.
   In this work, direct photodissociation cross sections of AlCl have been
   computed for transitions from the ground X-1 Sigma(+) state to six
   low-lying excited electronic states by using ab initio potential energy
   curves and transition dipole moments, which are obtained by the
   internally contracted multireference configuration-interaction method
   with Davidson correction and the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. State-resolved
   cross sections for transitions from 38 958 rovibrational levels (v `' <=
   100, J `' <= 400) of the ground X-1 Sigma(+) state have been obtained
   for photon wavelengths from 500 angstrom to the dissociation threshold.
   Photodissociation cross sections in local thermal equilibrium are
   evaluated for gas temperatures from 500 to 10 000 K. Using the computed
   cross sections, temperature-dependent photodissociation rates of X-1
   Sigma(+) in the interstellar and blackbody radiation fields are
   determined. The results can be applied to the investigation of the
   chemical evolution of Al in the envelope of carbon-rich and oxygen-rich
   stars.}},

Title = {{Vibronic spectra of aluminium monochloride relevant to circumstellar
   molecule{*}}},
Journal = {Chinese Phys. B},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
pages = {033102},
Abstract = {The A(1)pi -> X-1 sigma(+) transition system of aluminium monochloride
   is determined by using ab initio quantum chemistry. Based on the
   multi-reference configuration interaction method in conjugate to the
   Davidson correction (MRCI + Q), the potential energy curves (PECs) of
   the three electronic states are obtained. Transition dipole moments
   (TDMs) and the vibrational energy levels are studied by employing the
   aug-cc-pwCV5Z-DK basis set with 4220-active space. The rovibrational
   constants are first determined from the analytic potential by solving
   the rovibrational Schrodinger equation, and then the spectroscopic
   constants are determined by fitting the vibrational levels, and these
   values are well consistent with the experimental data. The effect of
   spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the spectra and vibrational properties are
   evaluated. The results show that the SOC effect has almost no influence
   on the spectroscopic constants of AlCl molecules. For the A(1)pi -> X-1
   sigma(+) transition, the highly diagonalized Frank-Condon factor (FCF)
   is f(00) = 0.9988. Additionally, Einstein coefficients and radiative
   lifetimes are studied, where the vibrational bands include nu `' = 0-19
   -> nu ` = 0-9. The ro-vibrational intensity is calculated at a
   temperature of 296 K, which can have certain astrophysical applications.
   At present, there is no report on the calculation of AlCl ro-vibrational
   intensity, so we hope that our results will be useful in analyzing the
   interstellar AlCl based on the absorption from A(1)pi -> X-1 sigma(+)},

Title = {Study of the aluminium content in AGB winds using ALMA Indications for
   the presence of gas-phase (Al2O3)n clusters},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2017},
Volume = {608},
Abstract = {Context. The condensation of inorganic dust grains in the winds of
   evolved stars is poorly understood. As of today, it is not yet known
   which molecular clusters form the first dust grains in oxygen-rich (C/O
   < 1) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) winds. Aluminium oxides and iron-free
   silicates are often put forward as promising candidates for the first
   dust seeds.
   Aims. We aim to constrain the dust formation histories in the winds of
   oxygen-rich AGB stars.
   Methods. We obtained Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter array
   (ALMA) observations with a spatial resolution of 120 x 150 mas tracing
   the dust formation region of the low mass-loss rate AGB star, R Dor, and
   the high mass-loss rate AGB star, IK Tau. We detected emission line
   profiles of AlO, AlOH, and AlCl in the ALMA data and used these line
   profiles to derive a lower limit of atomic aluminium incorporated in
   molecules. This constrains the aluminium budget that can condense into
   grains.
   Results. Radiative transfer models constrain the fractional abundances
   of AlO, AlOH, and AlCl in IK Tau and R Dor. We show that the gas-phase
   aluminium chemistry is completely different in both stars with a
   remarkable difference in the AlO and AlOH abundance stratification. The
   amount of aluminium locked up in these three molecules is small, <= 1.1
   x 10(-7) w.r.t. H-2, for both stars, i.e. only <= 2\% of the total
   aluminium budget. An important result is that AlO and AlOH, which are
   the direct precursors of alumina (Al2O3) grains, are detected well
   beyond the onset of the dust condensation, which proves that the
   aluminium oxide condensation cycle is not fully efficient. The ALMA
   observations allow us to quantitatively assess the current generation of
   theoretical dynamical-chemical models for AGB winds. We discuss how the
   current proposed scenario of aluminium dust condensation for low
   mass-loss rate AGB stars within a few stellar radii from the star, in
   particular for R Dor and W Hya, poses a challenge if one wishes to
   explain both the dust spectral features in the spectral energy
   distribution (SED) in interferometric data and in the polarized light
   signal. In particular, the estimated grain temperature of Al2O3 is too
   high for the grains to retain their amorphous structure. We advocate
   that large gas-phase (Al2O3)(n) clusters (n > 34) can be the potential
   agents of the broad 11 mu m feature in the SED and in the
   interferometric data and we propose potential formation mechanisms for
   these large clusters.},

Title = {Molecular abundances in the inner layers of IRC+10216},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {543},
Abstract = {Context. The inner layers of circumstellar envelopes around asymptotic
   giant branch stars are sites where a variety of processes such as
   thermochemical equilibrium, shocks induced by the stellar pulsation, and
   condensation of dust grains determine the chemical composition of the
   material that is expelled into the outer envelope layers and,
   ultimately, into interstellar space.
   Aims. We aim at studying the abundances, throughout the whole
   circumstellar envelope of the carbon star IRC +10216, of several
   molecules formed in the inner layers in order to constrain the different
   processes at work in such regions.
   Methods. Observations towards IRC +10216 of CS, SiO, SiS, NaCl, KCl,
   AlCl, AlF, and NaCN have been carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope
   in the 80-357.5 GHz frequency range. A large number of rotational
   transitions covering a wide range of energy levels, including highly
   excited vibrational states, are detected in emission and serve to trace
   different regions of the envelope. Radiative transfer calculations based
   on the LVG formalism have been performed to derive molecular abundances
   from the innermost out to the outer layers. The excitation calculations
   include infrared pumping to excited vibrational states and inelastic
   collisions, for which up-to-date rate coefficients for rotational and,
   in some cases, ro-vibrational transitions are used.
   Results. We find that in the inner layers CS, SiO, and SiS have
   abundances relative to H-2 of 4 x 10(-6), 1.8 x 10(-7), and 3 x 10(-6),
   respectively, and that CS and SiS have significant lower abundances in
   the outer envelope, which implies that they actively contribute to the
   formation of dust. Moreover, in the inner layers, the amount of sulfur
   and silicon in gas phase molecules is only 27\% for S and 5.6\% for Si,
   implying that these elements have already condensed onto grains, most
   likely in the form of MgS and SiC. Metal-bearing molecules lock up a
   relatively small fraction of metals, although our results indicate that
   NaCl, KCl, AlCl, AlF, and NaCN, despite their refractory character, are
   not significantly depleted in the cold outer layers. In these regions a
   few percent of the metals Na, K, and Al survive in the gas phase, either
   in atomic or molecular form, and are therefore available to participate
   in the gas phase chemistry in the outer envelope.},
