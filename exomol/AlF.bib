Abstract = {Recently, we determined the detailed energy level structure of the X-1
   Sigma(+), A(1)Pi and a(3)Pi states of AlF that are relevant to laser
   cooling and trapping experiments {[}Truppe et al., Phys. Rev. A. 100
   (5), 052513 (2019)]. Here, we investigate the b(3)Sigma(+), v = 0 state
   of the AlF molecule. A rotationally resolved (1+2)-REMPI spectrum of the
   b(3)Sigma(+), v' = 0 <- a(3)Pi, v `' = 0 band is presented and the
   lifetime of the b(3)Sigma(+), v = 0 state is measured to be 190(2) ns.
   Hyperfine-resolved, laser-induced fluorescence spectra of the
   b(3)Sigma(+), v' = 0 <- X-1 Sigma(+), v `' = 1 and the b(3)Sigma(+), v'
   = 0 <- a(3)Pi, v `' = 0 bands are recorded to determine fine- and
   hyperfine structure parameters. The interaction between the
   b(3)Sigma(+), v = 0 and the nearby A(1)Pi state is studied and the
   magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling between the two electronic states
   is derived using three independent methods to give a consistent value of
   10(1) cm(-1). The triplet character of the A state causes an A -> alpha
   loss from the main A-X laser cooling cycle below the 10(-6) level.
