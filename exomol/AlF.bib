Title = {{Using $^{26}$Al to detect ongoing self-enrichment in young
   massive star clusters}},

Abstract = {Self-enrichment is one of the leading explanations for chemical
   anomalies in globular clusters. In this scenario, various candidate
   polluter stars have been proposed to eject gas with altered chemical
   composition during the self-enrichment process. Most of the proposed
   polluters will also eject radioactive Al-26 into the surroundings.
   Hence, any detection of Al-26 in young massive star clusters (YMCs)
   would support the self-enrichment scenario if YMCs were indeed the
   progenitors of globular clusters. Observations of gamma-ray data from
   COMPTEL and INTEGRAL, as well as detections of (AlF)-Al-26 molecules by
   the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA), indicate the
   maturing of Al-26 detection methods. Detection possibilities will be
   enhanced in the short- to mid-term by the upcoming launch of the Compton
   Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could
   in principle also detect radio recombination lines of the positronium
   formed from the decay products of Al-26. Here, we show for a sample of
   YMCs in the nearby Universe, where self-enrichment could plausibly take
   place. For some nearby galaxies, this could enhance Al-26 by an order of
   one magnitude. Detecting (AlF)-Al-26 with ALMA appears feasible for many
   candidate self-enrichment clusters, although significant challenges
   remain with other detection methods. The Large Magellanic Cloud, with
   its YMC R136, stands out as the most promising candidate. Detecting a
   1.8 MeV radioactive decay line of Al-26 here would require at least 15
   months of targeted observation with COSI, assuming ongoing
   self-enrichment in R136.},

Title = {{Characterisation of the b(3)Sigma(+), v=0 state and its interaction with
   the A(1)Pi state in aluminium monofluoride}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {119},
pages = {e1810351},
Abstract = {Recently, we determined the detailed energy level structure of the X-1
   Sigma(+), A(1)Pi and a(3)Pi states of AlF that are relevant to laser
   cooling and trapping experiments {[}Truppe et al., Phys. Rev. A. 100
   (5), 052513 (2019)]. Here, we investigate the b(3)Sigma(+), v = 0 state
   of the AlF molecule. A rotationally resolved (1+2)-REMPI spectrum of the
   b(3)Sigma(+), v' = 0 <- a(3)Pi, v `' = 0 band is presented and the
   lifetime of the b(3)Sigma(+), v = 0 state is measured to be 190(2) ns.
   Hyperfine-resolved, laser-induced fluorescence spectra of the
   b(3)Sigma(+), v' = 0 <- X-1 Sigma(+), v `' = 1 and the b(3)Sigma(+), v'
   = 0 <- a(3)Pi, v `' = 0 bands are recorded to determine fine- and
   hyperfine structure parameters. The interaction between the
   b(3)Sigma(+), v = 0 and the nearby A(1)Pi state is studied and the
   magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling between the two electronic states
   is derived using three independent methods to give a consistent value of
   10(1) cm(-1). The triplet character of the A state causes an A -> alpha
   loss from the main A-X laser cooling cycle below the 10(-6) level.
