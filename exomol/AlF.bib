abstract = { Recently, we determined the detailed energy level structure of the X 1 Σ + , A 1 Π and a 3 Π states of AlF that are relevant to laser cooling and trapping experiments [Truppe et al., Phys. Rev. A. 100 (5), 052513 (2019)]. Here, we investigate the b 3 Σ + , v = 0 state of the AlF molecule. A rotationally resolved (1 + 2)-REMPI spectrum of the b 3 Σ + , v ′ = 0 ← a 3 Π , v ″ = 0 band is presented and the lifetime of the b 3 Σ + , v = 0 state is measured to be 190(2) ns. Hyperfine-resolved, laser-induced fluorescence spectra of the b 3 Σ + , v ′ = 0 ← X 1 Σ + , v ″ = 1 and the b 3 Σ + , v ′ = 0 ← a 3 Π , v ″ = 0 bands are recorded to determine fine- and hyperfine structure parameters. The interaction between the b 3 Σ + , v = 0 and the nearby A 1 Π state is studied and the magnitude of the spin–orbit coupling between the two electronic states is derived using three independent methods to give a consistent value of 10(1) cm − 1 . The triplet character of the A state causes an A → a loss from the main A−X laser cooling cycle below the 10 − 6 level. }
