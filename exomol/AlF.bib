Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of eight low-lying electronic states
   (X-1 Sigma(+), a(3)Sigma(+), b(3)Pi, d(3)Delta, C-1 Sigma(-), e3
   Sigma(-), D-1 Delta and A(1)Pi) of SiS molecule were investigated with
   the full valence complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)
   method followed by the highly accurate valence internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach with the
   correlation-consistent basis sets, aug-cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV6Z. Effect
   on the PECs by the relativistic correction is taken into account. The
   way to consider the relativistic correction is to use the second-order
   Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian (DKH2) approximation. And the relativistic
   correction is made at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. To obtain more
   reliable results, the PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are also
   corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson
   modification (MRCI+Q). The PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis
   set (CBS) limit by the two-point total-energy extrapolation scheme. With
   these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, D-e, R-e, omega(e)x(e),
   omega Y-e(e), B-e and alpha(e)) are determined and compared with those
   reported in the literature. With the PECs obtained by the MRCI+Q/DK+56
   calculations, the vibrational levels and inertial rotation and
   centrifugal distortion constants of the first 30 vibrational states are
   calculated for each electronic state involved here when the rotational
   quantum number J is equal to zero. Comparison with the measurements
   shows that the present total-energy extrapolation could improve the
   quality of spectroscopic parameters. On the whole, as expected, the
   spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants closest to the
   experimental data are determined by the MRCI+QJDK+56 calculations for
   these electronic states. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Vibration-rotation line lists for AlF, Al 35 Cl, and Al 37 Cl have been prepared in their ground electronic states (X ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/237/1/8/apjsaacc6aieqn1.gif] {${}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$} ). Experimental rotational and ro-vibrational lines were employed to calculate a potential energy surface (PES) by direct potential fitting. The PES was used to calculate ro-vibrational energy levels. Born–Oppenheimer Breakdown corrections were included in the energy level calculations for AlCl. Ro-vibrational energy levels were calculated for the v = 0 to v  = 11 vibrational levels and up to J max = 200 for the rotational levels. Dipole moment functions covering the range of the PES turning points were calculated for AlCl and AlF by ab initio methods and used to determine line intensities. Partition functions for temperatures up to 3000 K were calculated. AlF and AlCl have been detected in circumstellar envelopes and are predicted to occur in cool stellar and sub-stellar atmospheres.}
