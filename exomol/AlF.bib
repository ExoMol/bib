  abstract={Vibration-rotation line lists for AlF, Al 35 Cl, and Al 37 Cl have been prepared in their ground electronic states (X ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/237/1/8/apjsaacc6aieqn1.gif] {${}^{1}{{\rm{\Sigma }}}^{+}$} ). Experimental rotational and ro-vibrational lines were employed to calculate a potential energy surface (PES) by direct potential fitting. The PES was used to calculate ro-vibrational energy levels. Born–Oppenheimer Breakdown corrections were included in the energy level calculations for AlCl. Ro-vibrational energy levels were calculated for the v = 0 to v  = 11 vibrational levels and up to J max = 200 for the rotational levels. Dipole moment functions covering the range of the PES turning points were calculated for AlCl and AlF by ab initio methods and used to determine line intensities. Partition functions for temperatures up to 3000 K were calculated. AlF and AlCl have been detected in circumstellar envelopes and are predicted to occur in cool stellar and sub-stellar atmospheres.}
