Title = {{Theoretical study on spectroscopic properties of 10 Lambda-Sigma and 26 Omega states
   for AlH molecule}},
Journal = {ACTA PHYSICA SINICA},

Volume = {72},
Abstract = {On the basis of correcting various errors caused by spin-orbit coupling
   effects, scalar relativity effects, corevalence correlation effects and
   basis set truncation, the potential energy curves of 10 Lambda-S states
   and 26 Omega states of AlH molecule are calculated by using icMRCI + Q
   method. The transition dipole moments of 6 pairs of transitions between
   the X-1 Sigma(+)(0+), a(3)Pi(0+), a(3)Pi(1), a(3)Pi(2), and A(1)Pi(1)
   states are calculated by using the icMRCI/AV6Z{*} theory with the
   consideration of spin-orbit coupling effects. The spectral and
   transition data obtained here for AlH molecule are in very good
   agreement with the available experimental measurements. The findings are
   below. 1) The transition intensities are relatively strong of the Q(J')
   branches for the (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3),
   (1, 4) and (1, 5) bands of the A(1)Pi(1) - X-1 Sigma(+)(0+) transition,
   with the increase of J.; the Einstein A coefficients and vibrational
   branching ratio gradually decrease, and the weighted absorption
   oscillator strength gradually increases of Delta v = 0 band, the
   Einstein A coefficient, vibrational branching ratio, and weighted
   absorption oscillator strength gradually increase for the Delta v not
   equal 0 bands. 2) The radiation lifetimes of A(1)Pi(1)(v' = 0, 1)
   increases slowly as the J' increases. 3) The A(1)Pi(1) (v' = 0 and 1, J'
   = 1, +) -> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+) (v'' = 0-3, J'' = 1, -) transition of AlH
   molecule satisfies the criteria for laser cooling of diatomic molecules,
   that is, the vibrational branching ratio of the highly diagonal
   distribution, the extremely short radiation lifetimes of the
   A(1)Pi(1)(v' = 0 and 1, J' = 1, +) states, and the intermediate
   electronic states a(3)Pi(0+), a(3)Pi(1), and a(3)Pi(2) do not interfere
   with laser cooling. Therefore, based on the cyclic transition
   A(1)Pi(1)(v' = 0 and 1, J' = 1, +) <-> X-1 Sigma(+)(0+)(v'' = 0-3, J'' =
   1, -), we propose a feasible scheme for laser cooling of AlH molecule.
   When cooled, 2.541 x 10(4) photons can be scattered by four pump lasers
   used in the visible range, which are enough to cool AlH to the
   ultra-cold temperature, and the Doppler temperature and recoil
   temperature of the main transition are on the order of mu K.},

rotational structure of the Q branches in both bands has been measured
for the first time, and the A-doubling in the a(3)Pi,v = 0,1 levels
has been described by o,p and q parameters. For example, the values
for the v = 0 level are P-0 = 1.754(14) x 10(-2) cm(-1), q(0) =

molecular constants and b(3)Sigma(-) state by term values. The
observed irregularities in the b(3)Sigma(-) state have been
graphically described by plotting experimental minus calculated term
values versus quantum number N for the v = 0 level, as well as by
plotting reduced term values versus N(N + 1) for the v = 1 level.},

abstract = {Context. Dust is efficiently produced by cool giant stars, but the
condensation of inorganic dust is poorly understood. Observations of
key aluminum bearing molecules around evolved stars has enabled us to
investigate the nucleation of alumina (Al2O3)dust in the gas. Aims. We
aim to identify and characterize aluminum bearing species in the
circumstellar gas of Mira (o Ceti) in order to elucidate their role in
the production of Al2O3 dust. Methods. We used multiepoch spectral
line observations at (sub-) millimeter, far-infrared, and optical
wavelengths including: maps with ALMA that probe the gas distribution
in the immediate vicinity of the star at similar to 30 mas;
observations with ALMA, APEX, and Herschel in 2013 2015 for studying
cycle and inter-cycle variability of the rotational lines of Al-
bearing molecules; optical records as far back as 1965 to examine
variations in electronic transitions over time spans of days to
decades; and velocity measurements and excitation analysis of the
spectral features that constrain the physical parameters of the gas.
Results. Three diatomic molecules AlO, AlOH, and AlH, and atomic Al i
are the main observable aluminum species in Mira, although a
significant fraction of aluminum might reside in other species that
have not yet been identified. Strong irregular variability in the
(sub-) millimeter and optical features of AlO (possibly the direct
precursor of Al2O3) indicates substantial changes in the excitation
conditions, or varying abundance that is likely related to shocks in
the star. The inhomogeneous distribution of AlO might influence the
spatial and temporal characteristics of dust production. Conclusions.
We are unable to quantitatively trace aluminum depletion from the gas,
but the rich observational material constrains time-dependent chemical
networks. Future improvements should include spectroscopic
characterization of higher aluminum oxides, coordinated observations
of dust and gas species at different variability phases, and tools to
derive abundances in shock-excited gas.},

The ground state dipole moment has been determined for both
isotopologues (AlH and AID) and shown to depend critically on
vibrational averaging. For completeness, the isotropic and anisotropic
nuclear magnetic shielding tensors are also reported. All the results
agree well with the best available experimental measurements, and in
some cases (spin-rotation constants and dipole moments) refine the
known data. The present computational results for the vibrationally
averaged electric field gradients suggest that the currently accepted
nuclear quadruple moment for Al-27 of 146.6 +/- 1.0 mb may be slightly
underestimated. Based on the experimental measurements of the nuclear
quadrupole coupling for AlH (AID) and best computational
determinations of the vibrationally averaged electric field gradients,
the quadruple moment of Al-27 is determined to be 149 +/- 2 mb (148
+/- 3 mb). However, this conclusion would be further strengthened with
more precise experimental measurement of the Al-27 nuclear quadrupole
coupling for AlH and AID.},

elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long
remained a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation).
Aims. Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres,
update the M dwarf T-eff-spectral type relation, and find the
atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample. Methods. We compare
two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M dwarf sequence
with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a chi(2)
minimization technique to determine T-eff. The first sample consists
of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology Telescope
(NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55 medium-
resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO).
The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already classified
M dwarfs. Results. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra
reproduce the slope of the spectral energy distribution and most of
its features. Only the CaOH band at 5570 angstrom and AlH and NaH
hydrides in the blue part of the spectra are still missing in the
models. The T-eff scale obtained with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m
spectra is consistent with that obtained with the NTT spectra. We
compare our T-eff scale with those of other authors and with published
isochrones using the BT-Settl colors. We also present relations
between effective temperature, spectral type, and colors of the M
dwarfs.},

abstract = {The composition of the most primitive solar system condensates, such
as calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and micron-sized corundum
grains, show that short-lived radionuclides (SLR), e.g., 26Al, were
present in the early solar system. Their abundances require a local or
stellar origin, which, however, is far from being understood. We
present for the first time the abundances of several SLR up to 60Fe
predicted from stars with initial mass in the range approximately 711
M circle dot. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning.
After core C burning they go through a Super-asymptotic giant branch
(Super-AGB) phase, with the H and He shells activated alternately,
episodic thermal pulses in the He shell, a very hot temperature at the
base of the convective envelope (approximately 108 K), and strong
stellar winds driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding
interstellar medium. The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB
stars are mostly ONe white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce
26Al/27Al yield ratios approximately 0.020.26. These models can
account for the canonical value of the 26Al/27Al ratio using dilutions
with the solar nebula of the order of 1 part of Super-AGB mass per
several 102 to several 103 of solar nebula mass, resulting in
associated changes in the O-isotope composition in the range Delta 17O
from 3 to 20 parts per thousand. This is in agreement with
observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive solar system
condensates, which do not carry the signature of a stellar polluter.
The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron captures in
Super-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also matched by
some of our models, depending on the nuclear and stellar physics
uncertainties as well as the meteoritic experimental data. We also
expect and are currently investigating Super-AGB production of SLR
heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.},

are blended together. The data for AlD were fit with an effective
Hamiltonian and rotational, electric quadrupole, and nuclear spin-

of photolyzed trimethylaluminum with hydrogen or deuterium.
Spectroscopic constants for the upper and lower vibronic levels were
derived from fits to the measured transition wave numbers of the
rotational lines. Lifetimes of J' = 1 rotational/fine-structure levels
of electronically excited AlH/AlD(b 3Sigma-, upsilon' = 0) were
determined from fluorescence decay waveforms with laser excitation on
isolated rotational lines. The measured lifetimes were compared with
values obtained in a theoretical treatment of the excited-state decay
dynamics, wherein both radiative decay to the a (3)Pi state and
nonradiative decay through the repulsive 1 (3)Sigma(+) state were
considered. The experimental and theoretical lifetimes are in good
agreement. The theoretical treatment shows that the nonradiative
excited-state decay dominates over radiative decay. The observed fine-
structure dependence of the lifetimes results is due to the nature of
the spin-orbit coupling of the b (3)Sigma(-) state with the 1
(3)Sigma(+) continuum. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{92ZhShGr.AlH,
abstract = {We report the production of radical transients AlH and AlD in a
filament-source pulsed free-jet expansion. In this source, hydrogen
gas from a pulsed valve passes over hot tungsten filament wrapped by a
layer of aluminum wire. Liquid aluminum wetting the filament reacts
rapidly to form (AlH3)x oligomer. Depending on filament temperature,
either AlH or AlH2 sublimes from this oligomeric coating to be
entrained in subsequent pulses of H-2. The source has been
characterized by laser induced fluorescence and ionization-detected
one-photon absorption with time-of-flight mass resolution. Laser-
induced fluorescence measurements focus on the well-known A-X
transition of AIH. Higher energy ionization-detected absorption
spectra resolve the C 1-SIGMA+-X 1-SIGMA+, transition in AlH and AlD,
and for the first time the forbidden transition, b 3-SIGMA--X
1-SIGMA+, in AlH. Spectroscopic constants determined from an analysis
of bands assigned to upsilon = 0 and upsilon = 1 of the b 3-SIGMA-
state are T(e) = 40 524 cm-1, B(e) = 7.0675 cm-1, D(e) = 6.1 x 10(-5)
cm-1, alpha(e) = 0.637 cm-1, beta(e) = 6.38 x 10(-4), and gamma(e) =
1.5725, with upsilon = 0 spin-orbit and spin-rotation coupling
parameters lambda-0 = 0.29 cm-1, and gamma-0 = 0.03 cm-1, inducing
structure in a transition that appears to be predominantly parallel.
For upsilon = 1, spin-orbit coupling is much stronger, and rotational
branch intensities suggest interference, indicating that both parallel
and perpendicular components of the transition moment contribute to
the total oscillator strength. Results for the C-X (0-0) transitions
give B0 = 6.3869 cm-1 and D0 = 5.329 x 10(-4) with T0 = 44 594.05 cm-1
for the AlH C state, and B0 = 3.3457 cm-1 and D0 = 1.380 X 10(-4) cm-1
with T0 = 44 631.09 cm-1 for the AlD C state.},

abstract = {The electronic structure and electronic states of AlPh (P = porphin
dianion) have been investigated by means of SCF, two-configurations
SCF (TC-SCF) and contracted Cl calculations.  The binding energy
corresponding to the dissociation of the Al-H bond is 82 and 92
kcal/mol at the TC-SCF and Cl levels, appreciably larger than the
values of 55 and 59 kcal/mol obtained at the same levels of theory for
the diatomic hydride AlH (a consequence of the different nature of the
bonding with a sigma-bond involving a 3s orbital of Al in AlPH and a
3p-sigma orbital in AlH).  The two 3E-pi --> pi{*} states were
calculated at 20400 and 21200 cm-1 and the corresponding 1E states at
24600 and 44100 cm-1.  The 1E and 3E sigma --> pi{*} states (sigma
being the m.o. which is bonding between Al and H) were located at
33200 and 35400 cm-1.  The potential energy curves corresponding to
the dissociation of the Al-H bond in AlPH were calculated at the MR-
ClSD level with six electrons correlated.  A qualitative mechanism has
been proposed for the photolysis of the Al-X bond in AlPX (X = H or
CH3) on the basis of these potential energy curves.  A rationale has
also been given for the accelerating effect of visible light in the
reactions of aluminium alkyl- and arylporphyrins with nucleophiles.},

abstract={BY the aid of graphical methods1, we have constructed the potential curves Vj(r) for different rotational states of 1II in aluminium hydride. From estimations on the line width of the diffuse lines in the 1II; 1 band system, we were able to extend our constructions to wide nuclear spacing (r 3 {\texttimes} 108 cm.) as shown in Fig. 1. Reproducing the curve we found, that even now a potential barrier remains in 1II, the height of which is 400 cm.1, as related to the limit of dissociation. This result appears somewhat surprising, as in the few cases hitherto investigated (hydrogen, mercury hydride, etc.) a smooth approach of the potential curves to the limit of dissociation has been assumed. We are not in the position to distinguish between the alternatives, whether this barrier is a feature of the 1II--state itself or produced by the intersection of some unknown and repulsive 1II*;--state, as suggested in Fig. 1. In the latter case, the actual 1II--curve should be correlated to some excited state in the Al atom as already suggested by Kronig2, although for other reasons. In any event, by this construction the level scheme of AlH has been related to that of the Al atom, the position of the level = 0, J = 0 in 1II situated 1400 {\textpm} 50 cm1 below the limit of dissociation. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that some interesting cases of perturbations and predissociations in the excited 1 and 1 states4 are readily explained hereby.},

abstract={Eine neue Bande $\lambda$ 2033 wurde gefunden und einem Elektronensprung1$\Sigma${\textacutedbl}{\textrightarrow}1$\Sigma$ zugeschrieben. Die Kenntnis der schon vorher bekannten Bandensysteme ist erweitert. Der Intensit{\"a}tseffekt der Banden bei verschiedenen Drucken wurde eingehend studiert. Aus dem Zusammenhang zwischen den Tennen von AlH einerseits und den Termen von Al-Atomen andererseits wird versucht, einige Schl{\"u}sse auf die Dissoziationswerte zu ziehen. Gewisse Folgerungen {\"u}ber den Zerfall des Molek{\"u}ls sind aus den Rotationstermen abgeleitet, wobei auch die St{\"o}rungen eingehend behandelt werden. Von der Relation{\$}{\$}I = i.e^{\{}{\{}{\{}E{\_}0 {\}} {\backslash}mathord{\{}{\backslash}left/ {\{}{\backslash}vphantom {\{}{\{}E{\_}0 {\}} {\{}RT{\}}{\}}{\}} {\backslash}right. {\backslash}kern-{\backslash}nulldelimiterspace{\}} {\{}RT{\}}{\}}{\}} {\$}{\$}ausgehend, wurde die Intensit{\"a}tsverteilung innerhalb einer Bande diskutiert. Schlie{\ss}lich machen wir es wahrscheinlich, da{\ss} dem Intensit{\"a}tseffekt ein Labilwerden des Molek{\"u}ls im Zustand1II zugeschrieben werden mu{\ss}.},
