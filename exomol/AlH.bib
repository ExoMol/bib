abstract = {Context. Dust is efficiently produced by cool giant stars, but the
condensation of inorganic dust is poorly understood. Observations of
key aluminum bearing molecules around evolved stars has enabled us to
investigate the nucleation of alumina (Al2O3)dust in the gas. Aims. We
aim to identify and characterize aluminum bearing species in the
circumstellar gas of Mira (o Ceti) in order to elucidate their role in
the production of Al2O3 dust. Methods. We used multiepoch spectral
line observations at (sub-) millimeter, far-infrared, and optical
wavelengths including: maps with ALMA that probe the gas distribution
in the immediate vicinity of the star at similar to 30 mas;
observations with ALMA, APEX, and Herschel in 2013 2015 for studying
cycle and inter-cycle variability of the rotational lines of Al-
bearing molecules; optical records as far back as 1965 to examine
variations in electronic transitions over time spans of days to
decades; and velocity measurements and excitation analysis of the
spectral features that constrain the physical parameters of the gas.
Results. Three diatomic molecules AlO, AlOH, and AlH, and atomic Al i
are the main observable aluminum species in Mira, although a
significant fraction of aluminum might reside in other species that
have not yet been identified. Strong irregular variability in the
(sub-) millimeter and optical features of AlO (possibly the direct
precursor of Al2O3) indicates substantial changes in the excitation
conditions, or varying abundance that is likely related to shocks in
the star. The inhomogeneous distribution of AlO might influence the
spatial and temporal characteristics of dust production. Conclusions.
We are unable to quantitatively trace aluminum depletion from the gas,
but the rich observational material constrains time-dependent chemical
networks. Future improvements should include spectroscopic
characterization of higher aluminum oxides, coordinated observations
of dust and gas species at different variability phases, and tools to
derive abundances in shock-excited gas.},

minimization technique to determine T-eff. The first sample consists
of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology Telescope
(NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55 medium-
resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO).
The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already classified
M dwarfs. Results. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra
reproduce the slope of the spectral energy distribution and most of
its features. Only the CaOH band at 5570 angstrom and AlH and NaH
hydrides in the blue part of the spectra are still missing in the
models. The T-eff scale obtained with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m
spectra is consistent with that obtained with the NTT spectra. We
compare our T-eff scale with those of other authors and with published
isochrones using the BT-Settl colors. We also present relations
between effective temperature, spectral type, and colors of the M
dwarfs.},

abstract = {The composition of the most primitive solar system condensates, such
as calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and micron-sized corundum
grains, show that short-lived radionuclides (SLR), e.g., 26Al, were
present in the early solar system. Their abundances require a local or
stellar origin, which, however, is far from being understood. We
present for the first time the abundances of several SLR up to 60Fe
predicted from stars with initial mass in the range approximately 711
M circle dot. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning.
After core C burning they go through a Super-asymptotic giant branch
(Super-AGB) phase, with the H and He shells activated alternately,
episodic thermal pulses in the He shell, a very hot temperature at the
base of the convective envelope (approximately 108 K), and strong
stellar winds driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding
interstellar medium. The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB
stars are mostly ONe white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce
26Al/27Al yield ratios approximately 0.020.26. These models can
account for the canonical value of the 26Al/27Al ratio using dilutions
with the solar nebula of the order of 1 part of Super-AGB mass per
several 102 to several 103 of solar nebula mass, resulting in
associated changes in the O-isotope composition in the range Delta 17O
from 3 to 20 parts per thousand. This is in agreement with
observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive solar system
condensates, which do not carry the signature of a stellar polluter.
The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron captures in
Super-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also matched by
some of our models, depending on the nuclear and stellar physics
uncertainties as well as the meteoritic experimental data. We also
expect and are currently investigating Super-AGB production of SLR
heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.},

Each transition was found to be split into multiple hyperfine

are blended together. The data for AlD were fit with an effective
Hamiltonian and rotational, electric quadrupole, and nuclear spin-
rotation constants were determined for the molecule. The accuracy of
these constants has been improved by a factor of 2-3, compared to
previous studies. From these data, predictions for the J = 1 -> 0 and

been observed via its A (1)Pi-X (1)Sigma(+) electronic transition,
suggesting that this species may be present in circumstellar gas

@article{91RoVexx.AlH,
abstract = {The electronic structure and electronic states of AlPh (P = porphin
dianion) have been investigated by means of SCF, two-configurations
SCF (TC-SCF) and contracted Cl calculations.  The binding energy
corresponding to the dissociation of the Al-H bond is 82 and 92
kcal/mol at the TC-SCF and Cl levels, appreciably larger than the
values of 55 and 59 kcal/mol obtained at the same levels of theory for
the diatomic hydride AlH (a consequence of the different nature of the
bonding with a sigma-bond involving a 3s orbital of Al in AlPH and a
3p-sigma orbital in AlH).  The two 3E-pi --> pi{*} states were
calculated at 20400 and 21200 cm-1 and the corresponding 1E states at
24600 and 44100 cm-1.  The 1E and 3E sigma --> pi{*} states (sigma
being the m.o. which is bonding between Al and H) were located at
33200 and 35400 cm-1.  The potential energy curves corresponding to
the dissociation of the Al-H bond in AlPH were calculated at the MR-
ClSD level with six electrons correlated.  A qualitative mechanism has
been proposed for the photolysis of the Al-X bond in AlPX (X = H or
CH3) on the basis of these potential energy curves.  A rationale has
also been given for the accelerating effect of visible light in the
reactions of aluminium alkyl- and arylporphyrins with nucleophiles.},

abstract = {Simplified models of thermally pulsing red giants are investigated,
with particular emphasis on predicting the extent to which nuclear
processing at the base of the convective envelope in conjunction with
processing in the thermally unstable He shell can synthesize Al-26
(tau/1/2/ = 7.2 x 10 to the 5th yr). Values of Al-26/Al-27 of about
0.5-1, with Al-27/Al-27(solar) of about 1-2, are predicted in some
cases. It is pointed out that such results can lead to isotope shifts
in the absorption lines of AlH and AlO, which should be
observationally identifiable in some late-type supergiants. The
possible connection with the anomalous Mg-26 content (assigned to the
decay of Al-26) detected in some meteorites and the connection with
formation of the solar system are also touched on.},
