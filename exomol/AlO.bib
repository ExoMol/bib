Abstract = {A combined analysis of the A(2)Pi(i) -> X(2)Sigma(+) and B(2)Sigma(+) ->
   X(2)Sigma(+) band systems of AlO, involving 21,500 line assignments, has
   been performed. The analysis indicates that the previously reported
   gamma values of the B(2)Sigma(+) state are questionable. The present
   analysis shows that gamma(B(2)Sigma(+))approximate to 0.014 cm(-1),
   essentially independent of the vibrational level. The positive sign is
   consistent with second order interaction with the higher-lying C(2)Pi(r)
   and lower-lying A(2)Pi(i) states. It also appears that many of the
   previously reported gamma and gamma(D) values of X(2)Sigma(+) (v > 0)
   are doubtful. In fact, gamma(X(2)Sigma(+)) is observed to become
   increasingly negative for v `' > 1, due to second order interaction with
   the low-lying A(2)Pi(i) state. The present results are based on models
   where the hyperfine structure of the (2)Sigma(+) states has been taken
   into account explicitly. Intensity patterns of the branches of the
   B(2)Sigma(+) -> X(2)Sigma(+) system have been shown to be influenced by
   the case b beta(s) coupling in the ground state v = 0,1 levels. This
   gives rise to intensity differences of around 10 percent in the
   R(1)/R(2) and P(1)/P(2) doublet components. The synthesized intensity
   patterns are fully in accord with the F(1)/F(2) assignments of the
   present work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Molecular vibrations and electronic structure of the X(2)Sigma(+),
   B(2)Sigma(+), D(2)Sigma(+), and F(2)Sigma(+) states of AlO are studied

   potential energy curves occurs in the neighborhood of 4.0 a(0) and
   results in irregular vibrational levels of the D and F(2)Sigma(+)
   states. The vibrational constants for the F(2)Sigma(+) state are
   predicted from the vibrational levels not involved in the irregularity.
   Configuration mixing is important in describing the B, D, and
   F(2)Sigma(+) states. The F(2)Sigma(+) state at and around its well
   minimum and the D and F(2)Sigma(+) states in the avoided crossing region

Title = {{The g-tensor of AlO: Principal problems and first approaches}},
Journal = CP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {343},
Pages = {258-269},
Abstract = {Theoretical evaluations of g-tensors have seen noticeable progress in
   recent years. Promising results in agreement with experiment have been
   reported especially for small systems. However, the diatomic molecule
   AlO has proved to be a difficult test case. In contradiction to common
   understanding, the g-tensor of this system is strongly dependent on the
   internuclear distance. The vicinity of the first excited state A(2)Pi to
   the ground state X-2 Sigma(+) and their potential energy curve crossing
   close to the equilibrium distance contraindicate strongly the
   application of a conventional perturbation approach. Using a diabatic
   representation of the lowest electronic states, a vibrationally averaged
   value for Delta g(perpendicular to)(v = 0) = -608 ppm is obtained. The
   non-negligible contribution of high-lying excited states to the g-tensor
   indicate that a sum-over-states calculation is difficult to converge.
   Translating the ground state potential energy curve as to reproduce the
   relative position inferred from experiment and including higher (2)Pi
   states perturbationally yields our best estimate of Delta
   g(perpendicular to)(v = 0) = -1048 ppm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The spectrum of B-2 Sigma(+) system of AlO has been reduced on BOMEM DA8

   Nineteen bands of the Delta v = 1, 0, -1, and -2 sequences of this band

   fitted in a simultaneous least squares fit. The study has resulted in
   determining more precise vibrational and rotational constants of the two

   BeF, BeO-, BeCl,MgF, MgO-, and MgCl (class I); BF+, BCl+, AlF+, and
   AlCl+ (class II); and BO, BN-, BS, BP-, AlO, AlN-, AlS, and AlP- (class
   III). Most radicals have small Deltag(parallel to) values (approximate
   to -100 ppm) and large negative agi values (-800 to -8500 ppm), except
   for AlN- and AlP-, which have positive agi values (1400 and 10 000 ppm)
   due to the quasi-degeneracy X(2)Sigma (+)/1(2)Pi (i). The
   sum-over-states expansions for Deltag(perpendicular to) are dominated in
   classes I and II by the coupling with 1(2)Pi (r), and in class III with
   both 1(2)Pi (i) and 2(2)Pi (r). The (2)Pi (r)(3 sigma -->2 pi) state
   always contributes negatively, whereas (2)Pi (i)(1 pi -->3 sigma)
   contributes positively for most radicals but negatively for the boron
   series BO, BN-, BS, and BP-. Experimental g shifts, which are available
   for eight of the radicals studied here, are generally well reproduced by
   the Deltag values calculated at R,. However, for radicals having a very
   low-lying 1(2)Pi (i) state, such as AlN- and AlP-, our study suggests
   that future calculations should include vibrational averaging to
   describe the (unknown) experimental data correctly. Theoretical and

Journal = JCP,

Volume = {110},
Pages = {6240-6245},
Abstract = {The adiabatic electron affinities of five second row atoms (Al, Si, P,

   different density functional or hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional
   methods. The 15 species selected form a convenient closed set for which
   reliable experimental electron affinities exist for 13 of the species.
   Zero-point vibrational energy corrected electron affinities are also
   reported. Equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies were
   determined with each density functional method. The method based on the
   Becke exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation (BLYP)
   functional reproduced the experimental electron affinities most
   accurately, having an average absolute error of 0.15 eV. Using this
   functional, the electron affinities were predicted for SiO and SiO2,
   molecules for which electron affinities are not known experimentally, as
   0.11 eV and 2.03 eV, respectively. It is concluded that the accuracy
   observed for density functional theory methods applied to first row
   atoms and molecules extends to molecules containing second row atoms and
   that density functional theory continues to provide a computationally
   affordable means of producing electron affinities reliable to within a
   few tenths of an eV of definitive experimental values. (C) 1999 American

Abstract = {The infrared A2PI(i)-X2SIGMA+ band system of AlO has been recorded with
   Fourier transform techniques using an electrodeless 2450-MHz discharge
   as a source.  Transitions involving upsilon = 0-3 of X2SIGMA+ and
   upsilon = 0-10 of A2PI(i) have been observed.  Local perturbations
   affect the different levels of the A2PI(i) state, and all these
   perturbations are shown to be caused by vibrational levels of the
   X2SIGMA+ state.  Extra lines originating from the nominal upsilon = 7, 8
   levels of X2SIGMA+ are observed in the proximity of the A2PI(i) (upsilon
   = 2) <-> X2SIGMA+ (upsilon = 7) and A2PI(i) (upsilon = 3) <-> X2SIGMA+
   (upsilon = 8) crossings.  In total, data from 23 vibrational bands are
   included in the analysis.  The spin splittings of the X2SIGMA+ state are
   strongly dependent of upsilon''.  The X2SIGMA+ state also shows clearly
   noticeable nuclear hyperfine effects, manifested by numerous
   hyperfine-induced DELTAJ = +/-2 branches.  A global deperturbation has
   been performed for upsilon = 0-8 of A2PI(i) and for the corresponding
   intersecting levels upsilon = 5-11 of X2SIGMA+.  The X2SIGMA+ state has
   been fitted both with and without hyperfine parameters.  The inclusion
   of the hyperfine interaction was found to be necessary in order to
   describe the X2SIGMA+ ground state adequately.  The anomalous intensity
   distributions among branches terminating at different vibrational levels
   of the X2SIGMA+ state are discussed.  The strong B2SIGMA+-X2SIGMA+
   system has been recorded with FTS techniques, and the contradictory
   results of Mahieu et al. and Lagerqvist et al. regarding the gamma value
   of the B2SIGMA+ state are discussed in the light of the new
   parameterization of the X2SIGMA+ state, and the spin component
   assignments presented in the work of Lagerqvist et al. have been
   reestablished.  (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Abstract = {SCF calculations using an extended double-zeta basis set have been
   performed in order to obtain information about the energy spectrum of
   AlO. The variational calculations concerned six states of AlO and three
   states of AlO+. Correlation energy differences were estimated
   semiempirically to correct the single-configuration approximation. The
   predominant configurations of the observed states of AlO have been
   identified by using a comparison between the calculated and observed
   spectroscopic elements: term values, rotational, vibrational and
   spin-orbit constants, compatibility of observed systems. This has led us
   to deduce the probable locations of as yet unobserved states and to
   predict the wavelength of a number of transitions in which they are
   involved. The ground state of AlO+ has been found to be stable but its
   symmetry ((3)Pi or (1)Sigma(+)) could not be ascertained. Particular
   emphasis has been laid on a study of the (2 pi(3) 6 sigma(2) 7o3 pi)
   configuration or the highest-lying observed states of AlO. D-2 Sigma(+)
   and E-2 Delta(j). It is suggested that the quartet levels of this
   configuration are responsible for the perturbations experimentally found
   in C-2 Pi(I). The predissociation observed for E-2 Delta(i) is finally
   discussed in terms of avoided crossings of potential curves.},

Abstract = {A new circumstellar molecule, the radical AlO (X (2)Sigma(+)), has been
   detected toward the envelope of the oxygen-rich supergiant star VY Canis
   Majoris (VY CMa) using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). The N = 7 ->
   6 and 6 -> 5 rotational transitions of AlO at 268 and 230 GHz were
   observed at 1 mm using the ARO Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) and the N =
   4 -> 3 line was detected at 2 mm using the ARO 12 m telescope. Based on
   the shape of the line profiles, AlO most likely arises from the
   dust-forming region in the spherical outflow of VY CMa, as opposed to
   the blue or redshifted winds, with a source size of theta(s) similar to
   0.'' 5. Given this source size, the column density of AlO was found to
   be N(tot) similar to 2 x 10(15) cm(-2) for T(rot) similar to 230 K, with
   a fractional abundance, relative to H(2), of similar to 10(-8).
   Gas-phase thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry is the likely formation
   mechanism for AlO in VY CMa, but either shocks disrupt the condensation
   process into Al(2)O(3), or chemical ``freezeout{''} occurs. The species
   therefore survives further into the circumstellar envelope to a radius
   of r similar to 20 R({*}). The detection of AlO in VY CMa is additional
   evidence of an active gas-phase refractory chemistry in oxygen-rich
   envelopes, and suggests such objects may be fruitful sources for other
   new oxide identifications.},

Abstract = {Using density functional theory methods and large basis sets, we
   calculated hyperfine coupling constants (HFCCs) for the B-11, O-17,
   Al-27, and Ga-69 nuclei of the radicals BO, AlO, and GaO (XO), embedded
   in 2-14 rare gas (Rg) Ne and Ar atoms. Kr atoms were included for AlO.
   The distance of the Rg atoms from XO was varied from 4 to 12 bohr.
   Matrix effects cause A(iso)(X) to increase, accompanied by decreases in
   A(dip)(X) and A(dip)(O), while A(iso)(O) remains close to zero. Changes
   are largest for AlO, slightly smaller for GaO, and very small for BO, in
   line with the molecular polarizabilities. Observed changes of A(iso)(X)
   and A(dip)(X) for BO in Ne matrixes and for AlO in Ne, Ar, and Kr
   matrixes are reproduced in complexes with 12 Rg atoms at distances of
   5-6 bohr or 14 Rg atoms at distances of 6-7 bohr. For GaO, experimental
   data are available only in Ne matrixes. Theoretical results obtained for
   HFCCs of O-17 could not be verified due to insufficient experimental
   information. Estimates of HFCCs in matrixes not yet experimentally
   studied and for GaO in the gas phase have been made. Due to the
   interaction with rare gas atoms, p-spin density on the X and O atoms of
   XO is converted into s-spin density on X, thereby causing an increase
   (in magnitude) of A(iso)(X), accompanied by decreases in A(dip) of X and
   O. The higher polarizability of XO along the bond axis is reflected in
   complexes that have axial Rg atoms showing larger changes in HFCCs than
   comparable complexes without axial Rg atoms.},

Abstract = {A streak camera is used to obtain time-resolved AlO emission spectra
   from burning 10 micron aluminum particles in a CO2/Ar mixture at 8.6
   atmospheres in a shock tube. Digital spectra are obtained with a
   temporal resolution of 16 microseconds over the entire 180 microsecond
   combustion event. These spectra are fit to vibrational temperatures in
   the range of 4225 to 5900 K, with uncertainties ranging from 500 to 1400
   K. The estimated temperatures are in agreement to within experimental
   uncertainty with the predicted aluminum combustion temperatures under
   these conditions. The spectra show some evidence of a non-equilibrium
   vibrational population distribution during peak of the combustion event.},

   ion beam bombardment or laser ablation of an Al2O3 (Al) surface}},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {171},
Pages = {259-276},
Abstract = {A complex emission spectrum in the 440-550 nm region has been recorded
   by bombarding targets of Al2O3 (and Al under low O-2 partial pressure)
   polycrystalline surface with fast (5 keV) Kr+ ion beams under high
   vacuum (10(-8) Torr). This spectrum has been compared with the
   chemiluminescence spectrum of AlO formed by laser ablation of an Al
   target in the presence of oxygen. Both spectra exhibit strong Al lines,
   weak Al+ lines and very weak molecular features, among which bandheads
   of the Delta nu = 0, +/-1, +/-2 sequences of the AlO B(2)Sigma
   (+)-X(2)Sigma (+) system have been identified. The internal energy
   distribution of the AlO B state, determined by simulation of the B-X
   system, shows that both techniques yield highly vibrationally and
   rotationally excited AlO molecules in the B state. Local equilibrium is
   achieved (T-rot = T-vib similar or equal to 4000 K) for the B(2)Sigma
   (+) State of AlO formed via laser ablation, in agreement with previous
   studies and with a reaction scheme proceeding through a long-lived
   intermediate. In contrast, the AlO molecules formed in the B(2)Sigma (+)
   state through fast ion beam bombardment are much more rotationally than
   vibrationally excited. The rovibronic population distributions, most
   probably highly non-thermal, can be roughly represented by thermal
   populations corresponding to rotational and vibrational temperatures of
   13 000 and 5000 K, respectively. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Year = {2000},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {210-222},
Abstract = {High accuracy ab initio methods for computational thermochemistry have
   been applied to aluminum compounds expected to be present during
   combustion of aluminum particles. The computed enthalpies of formation
   at 298.15 It agree well with experimental values from the literature for
   AlCl, AlCl3, AlO, AlOAl, linear OAlO, planar Al2O2, AlOH, AlH, and AlN.
   The agreement is fair for AlCl2. Major revisions to the recommended
   thermochemistry must be considered for OAlCl, OAlH, OAlOH, and AlC. This
   is not surprising since the thermodynamic data for OAlCl, OAlN, OAlOH,
   and AlC are given in the literature as rough estimates. Calculated
   thermochemical data are also presented for several species never studied
   experimentally including AlH2, AlH3, AlOO, cyclic-AlO2, linear AlOAlO,
   AlHCl, AlHCl2, and others. Based on the performance of the CBS-Q and G2,
   methods observed in other systems, the calculated enthalpies of
   formation would be expected to be accurate to within +/-1 to 2 kcal
   mol(-1). However, relatively large differences between the results from
   the CBS-Q and G2 methods for the aluminum oxides indicate that the
   uncertainties are slightly larger for these compounds. The
   thermochemistry proposed here is shown to predict substantially
   different equilibrium composition from the thermochemistry previously
   available in the literature. (C) 2000 by The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {We describe a search for the A-X infrared bands of AlO with a view
	toward better understanding the characteristics of this radical.
	These bands are infrequently encountered in astronomical sources
	but surprisingly were very prominent in the spectra of two well-known,
	novalike variables (V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr) thereby motivating us
	to explore the physical conditions necessary for their excitation.
	In this study, we present the detection of A-X bands in the spectra
	of 13 out of 17 stars, selected on the basis of their J-K colors
	as potential candidates for detection of these bands. The majority
	of the AlO detections are in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,
	viz., nine OH/IR stars, two Mira variables, and two bright infrared
	sources. Our study shows that the A-X bands are fairly prevalent
	in sources with low temperature and O-rich environments. Interesting
	variation in the strength of the AlO bands in one of the sources
	(IRAS 18530+0817) is reported and the cause for this is examined.
	Possible applications of the present study are discussed in terms
	of the role of AlO in alumina dust formation, the scope for estimating
	the radioactive Al-26 content in AGB stars from the A-X bands, and
	providing possible targets for further mm/radio studies of AlO which
	has recently been discovered at millimeter wavelengths.},

  abstract = {The J = 2 <- 1 and 3 <- 2 rotational transitions of AlD (X (1)Sigma(+))
	near 393 and 590 GHz have been measured using submillimeter direct
	absorption spectroscopy. AlD was created in an AC discharge of Al(CH3)(3)
	and D-2 in the presence of argon. This work is the first direct measurement
	of the J = 3 <- 2 transition of AlD. Each transition was found to
	be split into multiple hyperfine components due to the Al-27 nuclear
	spin of I = 5/2, some of which are blended together. The data for
	AlD were fit with an effective Hamiltonian and rotational, electric
	quadrupole, and nuclear spin-rotation constants were determined for
	the molecule. The accuracy of these constants has been improved by
	a factor of 2-3, compared to previous studies. From these data, predictions
	for the J = 1 -> 0 and 4 -> 3 transitions of AlD have also been made.
	Photospheric AlH has been observed via its A (1)Pi-X (1)Sigma(+)
	electronic transition, suggesting that this species may be present
	in circumstellar gas surrounding late-type stars, where four aluminum-bearing

	a feasible candidate for searches in these objects as well.},

	Simulating the bands of AlO, we derive a rotational temperature of

	components of the bands, we derive the kinematical characteristics
	of the gas, finding that the emission is centred at the stellar radial
	velocity and its intrinsic width is 13.5 km s(-1) (full width at
	half maximum). It is the narrowest emission among all (thermal) features
	observed in VYCMa so far. The temperature and line widths suggest
	that the emission arises in gas located within similar to 20 stellar

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{610}},
Pages = {L29-L32},
Abstract = {{We have searched for the important radioactive isotope Al-26 in the
   nova-like source V4332 Sgr. Recent results from gamma-ray astronomy show
   that there is pervasive emission of the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray photon,
   arising from the decay of Al-26 to Mg-26, from all over the Galactic
   plane. Although the sites from where this emission originates are not
   clearly established, novae are believed to be an important contributing
   source. In this context, V4332 Sgr presented a rare opportunity to
   observationally investigate whether novae or nova-like sources
   synthesize Al-26 and to what extent. Strong AlO bands in the near-IR
   have been reported in this object recently. As molecular bands of
   different isotopic compositions are readily resolved spectroscopically
   (e.g., (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13), it was thought that the components of
   AlO associated with Al-26 and stable Al-27 could be detected as separate
   bands. Our spectra indicate that there is no strong presence of Al-26 in
   V4332 Sgr. A reliable upper limit of 0.10 for the Al-26/Al-27 ratio is
   determined, which constitutes the first observational constraint for
   this ratio in a potential Al-26-producing source. While V4332 Sgr is not
   a typical nova, its outburst amplitude and light-curve behavior bear
   close similarity to that of novae. Hence, although the results from
   V4332 Sgr cannot be directly extended to novae in general, the limit on
   the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio could be a useful input in constraining
   rather uncertain nucleosynthesis models for the production of Al-26 in
   novae/nova-like sources. When we compare the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio
   in V4332 Sgr with that expected in classical novae, it appears unlikely
   that the progenitor of V4332 Sgr is an oxygen-neon-magnesium white
   dwarf.}},

Abstract = {{The eruption of V4332 Sgr discovered in February 1994 shows striking
   similarities to that of V838 Mon started in January 2002. The nature of
   these eruptions is, however, enigmatic and unclear. We present new
   photometric and spectroscopic data on V4332 Sgr obtained in April-May
   2003 at the SAAO. The obtained spectrum shows an unusual emission-line
   component superimposed on an early M-type stellar spectrum. The
   emission-line spectrum is of very low excitation and is dominated by
   lines from neutral elemets ( NaI, FeI, CaI) and molecular bands ( TiO,
   ScO, AlO). We also analyse all the observational data, mainly
   photometric measurements, available for V4332 Sgr. This allows us to
   follow the evolution of the effective temperature, radius and luminosity
   of the object since February 1994 till 2003. We show that the observed
   decline of V4332 Sgr can be accounted for by a gravitational contraction
   of an inflated stellar envelope. The combined optical and infrared
   photometry in 2003 shows that apart from the M-type stellar component
   there is a strong infrared excess in the KLM bands. This excess was
   absent in the 2MASS measurements done in 1998 but was probably starting
   to appear in K in 1999 when the object was observed in the DENIS survey.
   We interpret the results in terms of a stellar merger scenario proposed
   by Soker \& Tylenda. The infrared excess is likely to be due to a
   disc-like structure which is either of protostellar nature or has been
   produced during the 1994 eruption and stores angular momentum from the
   merger event.}},

Title = {{Experimental determination of the temperature range of AlO molecular
   emission in laser-induced aluminum plasma in air}},
Journal = SCAB,
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Measurements with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIES) usually
   take place in the atmospheric air. For quantitative analysis of metallic
   elements, oxidation may represent an important issue which can
   significantly modify the stoichiometry of the plasma. Molecule formation
   in plasma should be therefore studied and taken into account in the LIBS
   practice. In this work, we experimentally investigated the temporal
   evolution and transformation of the plasma induced on an aluminum target
   by a nanosecond infrared (1064 nm) laser in the atmospheric air, in
   terms of its temperatures over a large interval of time from hundreds of
   nanoseconds to tens of microseconds. Such evolution was then correlated
   to the temporal evolution of the emission intensity from AlO molecules
   in the ablation plume. In particular, for a given ablation laser pulse
   energy, the appearance of the molecular emission while the plume cools
   down allows determining a minimal delay, tau(min), which corresponds to
   a maximal value of the temperature, T-max, below which the molecular
   emission begins to be clearly observed and to grow as a function of the
   delay. Such delay or such temperature indicates the longest delay or the
   lowest temperature for laser-induced plasma to be suitable for a correct
   analysis of metallic elements without significant influence of the
   alternation of the stoichiometry by oxidation. In our experiment, the
   values of tau(min), and T-max have been determined for a range of
   ablation laser pulse energies from 5 rill to 50 mJ. These values lie
   respectively in the range of 3 to 15 mu s for tau(min), and 4500 K to
   6600 K in terms of the molecule temperature for T-max. Beyond the
   practical interest for LIBS, our results provide also insights to the
   kinetics of the AlO molecule formation in laser-induced plasma.}},

AlO partial pressure dominates all the range of \{O2\} pressures/temperatures. AlO2 is the second most abundant species at low to intermediate temperatures (1200–1727 °C) and Al2O at higher temperatures (∼3300 °C). Al2O and Al2O2 are stable when ionized into mass spectrometer. Al2O3, AlO2 and, to a lesser extent AlO, will decompose, hindering their quantitative observation using this technique. "

Title = {{Search for aluminium monoxide in the winds of oxygen-rich AGB stars}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{598}},
Abstract = {{Context. Aluminium monoxide (AlO) is likely efficiently depleted from
   the gas around oxygen-rich evolved stars to form alumina (Al2O3)
   clusters and dust seeds. The presence of AlO gas in the extended
   atmospheres of evolved stars has been derived from optical spectroscopy.
   More recently, AlO gas was also detected at long wavelengths around the
   supergiant VY CMa and the oxygenrich asymptotic giant branch star o Cet
   (Mira A). The central role aluminium might play in dust formation and
   wind driving, in combination with these first detections of AlO at long
   wavelengths, shows the need for a wider search for this molecule in the
   winds of evolved stars.
   Aims. The detection at long wavelengths of emission in rotational
   transitions of AlO towards asymptotic giant branch stars can help
   constrain the presence and location of AlO gas in the outflows and
   ultimately also the efficiency of the depletion process.
   Methods. In search of AlO, we mined data obtained with APEX, the IRAM
   30m telescope, Herschel / HIFI, SMA, and ALMA, which were primarily
   aimed at studying other species around asymptotic giant branch stars. We
   report here on observations of AlO towards a sample of eight oxygen-rich
   asymptotic giant branch stars in different rotational transitions, up to
   seven for some stars. Results. We present definite detections of one
   rotational transition of AlO for o Cet and R Aqr, and tentative
   detections of one transition for R Dor and o Cet and two transitions for
   IK Tau and W Hya. The presented spectra of WX Psc, R Cas, and TX Cam
   show no signature of AlO. For o Cet, R Aqr, and IK Tau, we find that the
   AlO (N = 9 8) emission likely traces the inner parts of the wind, out to
   only a few tens of AU, where the gas has not yet been accelerated to its
   terminal velocity. This is in agreement with recently published results
   from a detailed study on o Cet.
   Conclusions. The conclusive detections of AlO emission in the case of o
   Cet and R Aqr confirm the presence of AlO in the gas phase in outflows
   of asymptotic giant branch stars. The tentative detections further
   support this. Since most of the observations presented in this study
   were obtained with stronger emission from other species than AlO in
   mind, observations with higher sensitivity in combination with high
   angular resolution will improve our understanding of the presence and
   behaviour of AlO. From the current data sets we cannot firmly conclude
   whether there is a direct correlation between the wind properties and
   the detection rate of AlO emission. We hope that this study can serve as
   a stimulus to perform sample studies in search of AlO in oxygen-rich
   outflows.}},

abstract = "Abstract Imaging emission spectroscopy, spatially resolved laser-absorption spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) are applied to a flat flame stabilized in a suspension of micron-sized aluminum. The results from the combination of diagnostics are used to infer the combustion regime of the particles and to estimate the characteristic combustion time of the suspension. It is observed that the reaction zone of the flame in stoichiometric aluminum–air suspensions exhibits strong self-reversal of the atomic aluminum emission lines. These lines also exhibit high optical depths in both emission and absorption spectroscopy. The strong self-reversal and high optical depths indicate high concentrations of aluminum vapor within the reaction zone of the flame at multiple temperatures. These features provide evidence of the formation of vapor-phase micro-diffusion flames around the individual particles in the suspension. In aluminum–methane–air flames, the lack of self-reversal and lower optical depths of the aluminum atomic lines indicate the absence of vapor-phase micro-diffusion flames, and point to a more heterogeneous, and likely kinetically-controlled, particle combustion regime. The reaction zone thickness is estimated from the spatially resolved profiles of aluminum resonance lines in both absorption and emission through the flame. The emission measurements yield a reaction zone thickness on the order of 1.7±0.3 mm in aluminum–air flames, and the absorption measurements yield a thickness on the order of 2.3±0.5. It is demonstrated that the combination of the combustion zone thickness measurement, flame temperatures determined from molecular AlO emission spectra, and particle velocity measurements from the \{PIV\} diagnostic permits an estimation of the burning time in the suspension. The burning time in stoichiometric aluminum–air suspensions using the suite of diagnostics is estimated to be on the order of 0.7 ms. "
