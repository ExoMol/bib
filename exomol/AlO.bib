Title = {{An optical transmission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33 b
   First indication of aluminum oxide in an exoplanet}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {622},
pages = {A71},
Abstract = {There has been increasing progress toward detailed characterization of
   exoplanetary atmospheres, in both observations and theoretical methods.
   Improvements in observational facilities and data reduction and analysis
   techniques are enabling increasingly higher quality spectra, especially
   from ground-based facilities. The high data quality also necessitates
   concomitant improvements in models required to interpret such data. In
   particular, the detection of trace species such as metal oxides has been
   challenging. Extremely irradiated exo-planets (similar to 3000 K) are
   expected to show oxides with strong absorption signals in the optical.
   However, there are only a few hot Jupiters where such signatures have
   been reported. Here we aim to characterize the atmosphere of the
   ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33 b using two primary transits taken 18 orbits
   apart. Our atmospheric retrieval, performed on the combined data sets,
   provides initial constraints on the atmospheric composition of WASP-33
   b. We report a possible indication of aluminum oxide (AlO) at 3.3-sigma
   significance. The data were obtained with the long slit OSIRIS
   spectrograph mounted at the 10-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We cleaned
   the brightness variations from the light curves produced by stellar
   pulsations, and we determined the wavelength-dependent variability of
   the planetary radius caused by the atmospheric absorption of stellar
   light. A simultaneous fit to the two transit light curves allowed us to
   refine the transit parameters, and the common wavelength coverage
   between the two transits served to contrast our results. Future
   observations with HST as well as other large ground-based facilities
   will be able to further constrain the atmospheric chemical composition
   of the planet.},

   seven lowest-lying doublet states of the AlO radical}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {37-48},
Abstract = {In this work, we report the potential energy curves for the X-2 Pi,
   A(2)Sigma(+), B-2 Sigma(+), G(2)Delta, G'(2)Sigma(-), C-2 Pi, and D-2
   Sigma(+) states of the AlO radical and the transition dipole moments
   between these states. The calculations are performed with the complete
   active space selfconsistent field method, followed by the valence
   internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach
   under the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that
   the rotationless radiative lifetimes are in the order of several hundred
   ns for the B-2 Sigma(+) state, several tens of ns for the C-2 Pi state,
   and several to more than ten ns for the first well of the D-2 Sigma(+)
   state. These lifetimes indicate that the transitions originated from
   these states easily occur. The rotationless radiative lifetimes are
   several to several hundred mu s for the G(2)Delta and G'(2)Sigma(-)
   states, and in the order of 10 to 100 mu s for the A(2)Sigma(+) state.
   The Einstein coefficients of emissions from the B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2
   Sigma(+), C-2 Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) and C-2 Pi-A(2)Pi systems, as well as from
   the first well of the D-2 Sigma(+) state to the X-2 Sigma(+) and A(2)Pi
   states are very large, suggesting that the transitions from these
   systems should be able to be measured readily via spectroscopy. The
   rovibrational constants are first obtained from the analytic potential
   by numerically solving the rovibrational Schrodinger equation, and then
   the spectroscopic parameters are evaluated by fitting the vibrational
   levels. The distributions of the intensity and wavelength of the
   spectral transitions are new. The radiative lifetimes reported in this
   work are also new for all vibrational levels of the C-2 Pi, G(2)Delta
   and G'(2)Sigma(-) states, as well as for upsilon >= 1 levels of the C-2
   Pi state. The results reported in this study can be used to detect the
   (AlO)-Al-26-O-16 radical in outer space.},

Abstract = {The long pulse ablation of aluminum wafers in ambient air using an Er:
   YAG laser at 2.94 mu m wavelength is presented. Visible emission spectra
   collected during ablation are assigned to the B-2 Sigma(+) -> X-2
   Sigma(+) molecular electronic transition of aluminum monoxide (AlO). A
   rovibronic model including self-absorption within the plume is developed
   to determine the molecular temperature. For a 60.2 mu s pulse at a
   fluence of 249.92 +/- 40 J/cm(2), a temperature of 2843 +/- 32 K and
   3013 +/- 30 K was found with the linear and nonlinear models,
   respectively. A greybody background with an emissivity of approximately
   1.3 x 10(-6) was observed, implying a low-volume mixing fraction of
   particulates in the plume. A linear fit of the Delta nu = -1 sequence
   was developed to rapidly analyze hundreds of spectra taken as background
   pressure was varied from 400 to 1000 mbar. The AlO temperature is
   approximately independent of background pressure. Finally, comparisons
   to other laser ablation studies at shorter wavelengths and shorter pulse
   durations are made wherever possible.},

Title = {{Search for aluminium monoxide in the winds of oxygen-rich AGB stars}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2017},
Volume = {598},
pages = {A53},
Abstract = {Context. Aluminium monoxide (AlO) is likely efficiently depleted from
   the gas around oxygen-rich evolved stars to form alumina (Al2O3)
   clusters and dust seeds. The presence of AlO gas in the extended
   atmospheres of evolved stars has been derived from optical spectroscopy.
   More recently, AlO gas was also detected at long wavelengths around the
   supergiant VY CMa and the oxygenrich asymptotic giant branch star o Cet
   (Mira A). The central role aluminium might play in dust formation and
   wind driving, in combination with these first detections of AlO at long
   wavelengths, shows the need for a wider search for this molecule in the
   winds of evolved stars.
   Aims. The detection at long wavelengths of emission in rotational
   transitions of AlO towards asymptotic giant branch stars can help
   constrain the presence and location of AlO gas in the outflows and
   ultimately also the efficiency of the depletion process.
   Methods. In search of AlO, we mined data obtained with APEX, the IRAM
   30m telescope, Herschel / HIFI, SMA, and ALMA, which were primarily
   aimed at studying other species around asymptotic giant branch stars. We
   report here on observations of AlO towards a sample of eight oxygen-rich
   asymptotic giant branch stars in different rotational transitions, up to
   seven for some stars. Results. We present definite detections of one
   rotational transition of AlO for o Cet and R Aqr, and tentative
   detections of one transition for R Dor and o Cet and two transitions for
   IK Tau and W Hya. The presented spectra of WX Psc, R Cas, and TX Cam
   show no signature of AlO. For o Cet, R Aqr, and IK Tau, we find that the
   AlO (N = 9 8) emission likely traces the inner parts of the wind, out to
   only a few tens of AU, where the gas has not yet been accelerated to its
   terminal velocity. This is in agreement with recently published results
   from a detailed study on o Cet.
   Conclusions. The conclusive detections of AlO emission in the case of o
   Cet and R Aqr confirm the presence of AlO in the gas phase in outflows
   of asymptotic giant branch stars. The tentative detections further
   support this. Since most of the observations presented in this study
   were obtained with stronger emission from other species than AlO in
   mind, observations with higher sensitivity in combination with high
   angular resolution will improve our understanding of the presence and
   behaviour of AlO. From the current data sets we cannot firmly conclude
   whether there is a direct correlation between the wind properties and
   the detection rate of AlO emission. We hope that this study can serve as
   a stimulus to perform sample studies in search of AlO in oxygen-rich
   outflows.},

abstract = {Abstract Imaging emission spectroscopy, spatially resolved laser-absorption
spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) are applied to a flat flame stabilized
in a suspension of micron-sized aluminum. The results from the combination of diagnostics
are used to infer the combustion regime of the particles and to estimate the characteristic
combustion time of the suspension. It is observed that the reaction zone of the flame
in stoichiometric aluminum–air suspensions exhibits strong self-reversal of the atomic
aluminum emission lines. These lines also exhibit high optical depths in both emission
and absorption spectroscopy. The strong self-reversal and high optical depths indicate high
concentrations of aluminum vapor within the reaction zone of the flame at multiple temperatures.
These features provide evidence of the formation of vapor-phase micro-diffusion flames around the
individual particles in the suspension. In aluminum–methane–air flames, the lack of self-reversal
and lower optical depths of the aluminum atomic lines indicate the absence of vapor-phase
micro-diffusion flames, and point to a more heterogeneous, and likely kinetically-controlled,
particle combustion regime. The reaction zone thickness is estimated from the spatially resolved
profiles of aluminum resonance lines in both absorption and emission through the flame.
The emission measurements yield a reaction zone thickness on the order of 1.7±0.3 mm in
aluminum–air flames, and the absorption measurements yield a thickness on the order of 2.3±0.5.
It is demonstrated that the combination of the combustion zone thickness measurement, flame
temperatures determined from molecular AlO emission spectra, and particle velocity measurements
from the \{PIV\} diagnostic permits an estimation of the burning time in the suspension.
The burning time in stoichiometric aluminum–air suspensions using the suite of diagnostics
is estimated to be on the order of 0.7 ms.},

   emission in laser-induced aluminum plasma in air}},
Journal = SCAB,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {193-200},
Abstract = {Measurements with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIES) usually
   take place in the atmospheric air. For quantitative analysis of metallic
   elements, oxidation may represent an important issue which can
   significantly modify the stoichiometry of the plasma. Molecule formation
   in plasma should be therefore studied and taken into account in the LIBS
   practice. In this work, we experimentally investigated the temporal
   evolution and transformation of the plasma induced on an aluminum target
   by a nanosecond infrared (1064 nm) laser in the atmospheric air, in
   terms of its temperatures over a large interval of time from hundreds of
   nanoseconds to tens of microseconds. Such evolution was then correlated
   to the temporal evolution of the emission intensity from AlO molecules
   in the ablation plume. In particular, for a given ablation laser pulse
   energy, the appearance of the molecular emission while the plume cools
   down allows determining a minimal delay, tau(min), which corresponds to
   a maximal value of the temperature, T-max, below which the molecular
   emission begins to be clearly observed and to grow as a function of the
   delay. Such delay or such temperature indicates the longest delay or the
   lowest temperature for laser-induced plasma to be suitable for a correct
   analysis of metallic elements without significant influence of the
   alternation of the stoichiometry by oxidation. In our experiment, the
   values of tau(min), and T-max have been determined for a range of
   ablation laser pulse energies from 5 rill to 50 mJ. These values lie
   respectively in the range of 3 to 15 mu s for tau(min), and 4500 K to
   6600 K in terms of the molecule temperature for T-max. Beyond the
   practical interest for LIBS, our results provide also insights to the
   kinetics of the AlO molecule formation in laser-induced plasma.},

  abstract = {We describe a search for the A-X infrared bands of AlO with a view
	toward better understanding the characteristics of this radical.
	These bands are infrequently encountered in astronomical sources
	but surprisingly were very prominent in the spectra of two well-known,
	novalike variables (V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr) thereby motivating us
	to explore the physical conditions necessary for their excitation.
	In this study, we present the detection of A-X bands in the spectra
	of 13 out of 17 stars, selected on the basis of their J-K colors
	as potential candidates for detection of these bands. The majority
	of the AlO detections are in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,
	viz., nine OH/IR stars, two Mira variables, and two bright infrared
	sources. Our study shows that the A-X bands are fairly prevalent
	in sources with low temperature and O-rich environments. Interesting
	variation in the strength of the AlO bands in one of the sources
	(IRAS 18530+0817) is reported and the cause for this is examined.
	Possible applications of the present study are discussed in terms
	of the role of AlO in alumina dust formation, the scope for estimating
	the radioactive Al-26 content in AGB stars from the A-X bands, and
	providing possible targets for further mm/radio studies of AlO which
	has recently been discovered at millimeter wavelengths.},

Abstract = {A combined analysis of the A(2)Pi(i) -> X(2)Sigma(+) and B(2)Sigma(+) ->
   X(2)Sigma(+) band systems of AlO, involving 21,500 line assignments, has
   been performed. The analysis indicates that the previously reported
   gamma values of the B(2)Sigma(+) state are questionable. The present
   analysis shows that gamma(B(2)Sigma(+))approximate to 0.014 cm(-1),
   essentially independent of the vibrational level. The positive sign is
   consistent with second order interaction with the higher-lying C(2)Pi(r)
   and lower-lying A(2)Pi(i) states. It also appears that many of the
   previously reported gamma and gamma(D) values of X(2)Sigma(+) (v > 0)
   are doubtful. In fact, gamma(X(2)Sigma(+)) is observed to become
   increasingly negative for v `' > 1, due to second order interaction with
   the low-lying A(2)Pi(i) state. The present results are based on models
   where the hyperfine structure of the (2)Sigma(+) states has been taken
   into account explicitly. Intensity patterns of the branches of the
   B(2)Sigma(+) -> X(2)Sigma(+) system have been shown to be influenced by
   the case b beta(s) coupling in the ground state v = 0,1 levels. This
   gives rise to intensity differences of around 10 percent in the
   R(1)/R(2) and P(1)/P(2) doublet components. The synthesized intensity
   patterns are fully in accord with the F(1)/F(2) assignments of the

Abstract = {A new circumstellar molecule, the radical AlO (X (2)Sigma(+)), has been
   detected toward the envelope of the oxygen-rich supergiant star VY Canis
   Majoris (VY CMa) using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). The N = 7 ->
   6 and 6 -> 5 rotational transitions of AlO at 268 and 230 GHz were
   observed at 1 mm using the ARO Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) and the N =
   4 -> 3 line was detected at 2 mm using the ARO 12 m telescope. Based on
   the shape of the line profiles, AlO most likely arises from the
   dust-forming region in the spherical outflow of VY CMa, as opposed to
   the blue or redshifted winds, with a source size of theta(s) similar to
   0.'' 5. Given this source size, the column density of AlO was found to
   be N(tot) similar to 2 x 10(15) cm(-2) for T(rot) similar to 230 K, with
   a fractional abundance, relative to H(2), of similar to 10(-8).
   Gas-phase thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry is the likely formation
   mechanism for AlO in VY CMa, but either shocks disrupt the condensation
   process into Al(2)O(3), or chemical ``freezeout{''} occurs. The species
   therefore survives further into the circumstellar envelope to a radius
   of r similar to 20 R({*}). The detection of AlO in VY CMa is additional
   evidence of an active gas-phase refractory chemistry in oxygen-rich

Abstract = {Theoretical evaluations of g-tensors have seen noticeable progress in
   recent years. Promising results in agreement with experiment have been
   reported especially for small systems. However, the diatomic molecule
   AlO has proved to be a difficult test case. In contradiction to common
   understanding, the g-tensor of this system is strongly dependent on the
   internuclear distance. The vicinity of the first excited state A(2)Pi to
   the ground state X-2 Sigma(+) and their potential energy curve crossing
   close to the equilibrium distance contraindicate strongly the
   application of a conventional perturbation approach. Using a diabatic
   representation of the lowest electronic states, a vibrationally averaged
   value for Delta g(perpendicular to)(v = 0) = -608 ppm is obtained. The
   non-negligible contribution of high-lying excited states to the g-tensor
   indicate that a sum-over-states calculation is difficult to converge.
   Translating the ground state potential energy curve as to reproduce the

Abstract = {The eruption of V4332 Sgr discovered in February 1994 shows striking
   similarities to that of V838 Mon started in January 2002. The nature of
   these eruptions is, however, enigmatic and unclear. We present new
   photometric and spectroscopic data on V4332 Sgr obtained in April-May
   2003 at the SAAO. The obtained spectrum shows an unusual emission-line
   component superimposed on an early M-type stellar spectrum. The
   emission-line spectrum is of very low excitation and is dominated by
   lines from neutral elemets ( NaI, FeI, CaI) and molecular bands ( TiO,
   ScO, AlO). We also analyse all the observational data, mainly
   photometric measurements, available for V4332 Sgr. This allows us to
   follow the evolution of the effective temperature, radius and luminosity
   of the object since February 1994 till 2003. We show that the observed
   decline of V4332 Sgr can be accounted for by a gravitational contraction
   of an inflated stellar envelope. The combined optical and infrared
   photometry in 2003 shows that apart from the M-type stellar component
   there is a strong infrared excess in the KLM bands. This excess was
   absent in the 2MASS measurements done in 1998 but was probably starting
   to appear in K in 1999 when the object was observed in the DENIS survey.
   We interpret the results in terms of a stellar merger scenario proposed
   by Soker \& Tylenda. The infrared excess is likely to be due to a
   disc-like structure which is either of protostellar nature or has been
   produced during the 1994 eruption and stores angular momentum from the
   merger event.},

Abstract = {Using density functional theory methods and large basis sets, we

   in 2-14 rare gas (Rg) Ne and Ar atoms. Kr atoms were included for AlO.
   The distance of the Rg atoms from XO was varied from 4 to 12 bohr.
   Matrix effects cause A(iso)(X) to increase, accompanied by decreases in
   A(dip)(X) and A(dip)(O), while A(iso)(O) remains close to zero. Changes
   are largest for AlO, slightly smaller for GaO, and very small for BO, in
   line with the molecular polarizabilities. Observed changes of A(iso)(X)
   and A(dip)(X) for BO in Ne matrixes and for AlO in Ne, Ar, and Kr
   matrixes are reproduced in complexes with 12 Rg atoms at distances of
   5-6 bohr or 14 Rg atoms at distances of 6-7 bohr. For GaO, experimental
   data are available only in Ne matrixes. Theoretical results obtained for
   HFCCs of O-17 could not be verified due to insufficient experimental
   information. Estimates of HFCCs in matrixes not yet experimentally
   studied and for GaO in the gas phase have been made. Due to the
   interaction with rare gas atoms, p-spin density on the X and O atoms of
   XO is converted into s-spin density on X, thereby causing an increase
   (in magnitude) of A(iso)(X), accompanied by decreases in A(dip) of X and
   O. The higher polarizability of XO along the bond axis is reflected in

Title = {{A search for radioactive Al-26 in the nova- like variable V4332   Sagittarii}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {610},
Pages = {L29-L32},
Abstract = {We have searched for the important radioactive isotope Al-26 in the
   nova-like source V4332 Sgr. Recent results from gamma-ray astronomy show
   that there is pervasive emission of the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray photon,
   arising from the decay of Al-26 to Mg-26, from all over the Galactic
   plane. Although the sites from where this emission originates are not
   clearly established, novae are believed to be an important contributing
   source. In this context, V4332 Sgr presented a rare opportunity to
   observationally investigate whether novae or nova-like sources
   synthesize Al-26 and to what extent. Strong AlO bands in the near-IR
   have been reported in this object recently. As molecular bands of
   different isotopic compositions are readily resolved spectroscopically
   (e.g., (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13), it was thought that the components of
   AlO associated with Al-26 and stable Al-27 could be detected as separate
   bands. Our spectra indicate that there is no strong presence of Al-26 in
   V4332 Sgr. A reliable upper limit of 0.10 for the Al-26/Al-27 ratio is
   determined, which constitutes the first observational constraint for
   this ratio in a potential Al-26-producing source. While V4332 Sgr is not
   a typical nova, its outburst amplitude and light-curve behavior bear
   close similarity to that of novae. Hence, although the results from
   V4332 Sgr cannot be directly extended to novae in general, the limit on
   the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio could be a useful input in constraining

   perturbation theory, a Hamiltonian based on Breit-Pauli theory, and

   BeF, BeO-, BeCl,MgF, MgO-, and MgCl (class I); BF+, BCl+, AlF+, and
   AlCl+ (class II); and BO, BN-, BS, BP-, AlO, AlN-, AlS, and AlP- (class
   III). Most radicals have small Deltag(parallel to) values (approximate
   to -100 ppm) and large negative agi values (-800 to -8500 ppm), except
   for AlN- and AlP-, which have positive agi values (1400 and 10 000 ppm)
   due to the quasi-degeneracy X(2)Sigma (+)/1(2)Pi (i). The
   sum-over-states expansions for Deltag(perpendicular to) are dominated in
   classes I and II by the coupling with 1(2)Pi (r), and in class III with
   both 1(2)Pi (i) and 2(2)Pi (r). The (2)Pi (r)(3 sigma -->2 pi) state
   always contributes negatively, whereas (2)Pi (i)(1 pi -->3 sigma)
   contributes positively for most radicals but negatively for the boron
   series BO, BN-, BS, and BP-. Experimental g shifts, which are available
   for eight of the radicals studied here, are generally well reproduced by
   the Deltag values calculated at R,. However, for radicals having a very
   low-lying 1(2)Pi (i) state, such as AlN- and AlP-, our study suggests
   that future calculations should include vibrational averaging to
   describe the (unknown) experimental data correctly. Theoretical and
   experimental g(perpendicular to) shifts are compared with those

Abstract = {High accuracy ab initio methods for computational thermochemistry have

   The agreement is fair for AlCl2. Major revisions to the recommended
   thermochemistry must be considered for OAlCl, OAlH, OAlOH, and AlC. This
   is not surprising since the thermodynamic data for OAlCl, OAlN, OAlOH,
   and AlC are given in the literature as rough estimates. Calculated
   thermochemical data are also presented for several species never studied
   experimentally including AlH2, AlH3, AlOO, cyclic-AlO2, linear AlOAlO,

   different equilibrium composition from the thermochemistry previously

   polycrystalline surface with fast (5 keV) Kr+ ion beams under high

   weak Al+ lines and very weak molecular features, among which bandheads
   of the Delta nu = 0, +/-1, +/-2 sequences of the AlO B(2)Sigma
   (+)-X(2)Sigma (+) system have been identified. The internal energy
   distribution of the AlO B state, determined by simulation of the B-X

   rotationally excited AlO molecules in the B state. Local equilibrium is
   achieved (T-rot = T-vib similar or equal to 4000 K) for the B(2)Sigma

   Zero-point vibrational energy corrected electron affinities are also
   reported. Equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies were

   Becke exchange functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr correlation (BLYP)
   functional reproduced the experimental electron affinities most

Year = {1994},

Pages = {1-38},
Abstract = {The infrared A2PI(i)-X2SIGMA+ band system of AlO has been recorded with
   Fourier transform techniques using an electrodeless 2450-MHz discharge
   as a source.  Transitions involving upsilon = 0-3 of X2SIGMA+ and
   upsilon = 0-10 of A2PI(i) have been observed.  Local perturbations
   affect the different levels of the A2PI(i) state, and all these
   perturbations are shown to be caused by vibrational levels of the
   X2SIGMA+ state.  Extra lines originating from the nominal upsilon = 7, 8
   levels of X2SIGMA+ are observed in the proximity of the A2PI(i) (upsilon
   = 2) <-> X2SIGMA+ (upsilon = 7) and A2PI(i) (upsilon = 3) <-> X2SIGMA+
   (upsilon = 8) crossings.  In total, data from 23 vibrational bands are
   included in the analysis.  The spin splittings of the X2SIGMA+ state are
   strongly dependent of upsilon''.  The X2SIGMA+ state also shows clearly
   noticeable nuclear hyperfine effects, manifested by numerous
   hyperfine-induced DELTAJ = +/-2 branches.  A global deperturbation has
   been performed for upsilon = 0-8 of A2PI(i) and for the corresponding
   intersecting levels upsilon = 5-11 of X2SIGMA+.  The X2SIGMA+ state has
   been fitted both with and without hyperfine parameters.  The inclusion
   of the hyperfine interaction was found to be necessary in order to
   describe the X2SIGMA+ ground state adequately.  The anomalous intensity
   distributions among branches terminating at different vibrational levels
   of the X2SIGMA+ state are discussed.  The strong B2SIGMA+-X2SIGMA+
   system has been recorded with FTS techniques, and the contradictory

molecule line positions in the A2Πi - X2∑+ system are tentatively proposed.
Indeed, the available data on the C2Πr → X2∑+ and C2Πr → A2Πi transitions permit
us to derive about 2400 energy level differences in the A-X system corresponding
to the six ν-connected bands 0-0, 0-1, 0-2, 1-0, 1-1 and 1-2. A unique and consistent
set of rovibrational constants is derived from a global fitting, allowing to reproduce
the observed differences with a total standard deviation of 0.053 cm-1. A catalogue
of vacuum line wavenumbers in the six bands is generated and can be made available
on request. The synthetic spectra are expected to represent properly the true spectra
at least up to J ~ 35.5 and can therefore be of usefulness for the detection of the
system in the spectra of M giant- and Mira-type stars. Franck-Condon factors and
r-centroïds appropriate to RKR potentials and estimates of intensities in emission

band system has been made through various tests. Franck—Condon (FC) factors
andr-centroidsr¯v′v′′ with the use of RKR potential have been evaluated and have
been employed to derive expressionR e(r) for electronic transition moment variation
with internuclear distancer, 01 both by linear and quadratic fitting. Using suchR e(r)
relations in conjunction with FC factors and also with experimental band
strengths (I/v v′v″ 4 , Smoothed Condon (P v/t’v/t") factors andβ(=I/P v/t’v/t" v v′v″ 4 , the
ratio of experimental band strength (I/v v/t’v/t" 4 to the calculated Smoothed
Condon (P v/t’v/t") factor has been determined. Through the comparison ofP v/t’v/t"’s andβ’s
of RKR potential and ofMorse potential, the efficacy ofMorse potential relative
to RKR has been discussed. Vibrational temperatures for all the three thermal
sources of excitation of bands, viz. Shock Tube, Low Pressure Arc and Exploding
Wire have been deduced both under constancy ofR e and variation ofR e withr.
These estimates on vibrational temperatures with the source temperatures have
been discussed in the light of the findings ofLinton andNicholls and conclusions
regarding relative merits of the two potentials indicated.},

transient spark (1 μs duration) in an environmental atmosphere of pure oxygen.
During the cooling-down period of the so formed Al/O-plasma, the reaction Al + O + M -> AlO + M
is observed. It can be shown that the conditions within the limited reacting gas
volume may be considered as quasi-stationary and hence the laws of chemical equilibrium
for computing number densities of atoms and molecules may be applied. The emissivity
ɛrel (radiation per unit volume) of the AlO B2 Σ → 2Σ system at 4842 Å and the gas
temperature of the decaying plasma are recorded in terms of a laboratory time scale.
The maximum of ɛrel (normalized maximum) may be correlated to the dissociation
energy of AlO, yielding 5.17 ±0.3 eV. Effects of dilution, the pressure influence
as well as the vibrational relaxation of AlO during its formation are considered
and included in the calculations.},

Abstract = {SCF calculations using an extended double-zeta basis set have been
   performed in order to obtain information about the energy spectrum of
   AlO. The variational calculations concerned six states of AlO and three
   states of AlO+. Correlation energy differences were estimated
   semiempirically to correct the single-configuration approximation. The
   predominant configurations of the observed states of AlO have been
   identified by using a comparison between the calculated and observed
   spectroscopic elements: term values, rotational, vibrational and
   spin-orbit constants, compatibility of observed systems. This has led us
   to deduce the probable locations of as yet unobserved states and to
   predict the wavelength of a number of transitions in which they are
   involved. The ground state of AlO+ has been found to be stable but its
   symmetry ((3)Pi or (1)Sigma(+)) could not be ascertained. Particular
   emphasis has been laid on a study of the (2 pi(3) 6 sigma(2) 7o3 pi)
   configuration or the highest-lying observed states of AlO. D-2 Sigma(+)
   and E-2 Delta(j). It is suggested that the quartet levels of this
   configuration are responsible for the perturbations experimentally found
   in C-2 Pi(I). The predissociation observed for E-2 Delta(i) is finally
   discussed in terms of avoided crossings of potential curves.},
