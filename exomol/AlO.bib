   abstract = {Aluminum Oxide (AlO) emission can be an important indicator of reaction and temperature in combustion and explosion systems. The Δv=-1 and particularly Δv=-2 sequences are attractive for temperature measurement, but have presented some challenges in modelling, especially for high vibrational energy transitions. Recent studies and ab initio simulations have offered parameters for the simulation of high resolution AlO spectra (Patrascu et.al. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc., 2015). In this paper we compare simulated spectra with high resolution emissions of AlO, both from laser induced breakdown spectroscopy and carefully calibrated shock tube experiments (3000<T<5000 K). In this manner, we assess the spectral model and its capacity for temperature assignment, rather than assume model accuracy and a best-fit-temperature. The experimental and modeled spectra agree below 0.1 Å resolution, and line features agree within our experimental resolution, in some regions down to 3 pm. Least squares fitting was performed on the experimental spectra, resulting in temperatures in agreement with calibration temperatures. The Δv=-2 sequence fits with residuals less than 4%. Our analysis suggests that experimental measurements with a resolution of 0.2 nm in this sequence can reliably fit the temperature within 100 K. Because of the apparently accurate fits to temperature, apparent accuracy of line position list, and reasonableness of line width model, we assess that the line strengths are likely also accurate and that ab initio simulated calibrations are useful for measuring temperature in AlO.}

   Jupiter HAT-P-41b}},
Journal = AJ,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {161},
pages = {51},
Abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the 0.3-5 mu m transit spectrum
   for the inflated hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b. The planet was observed in
   transit with Hubble STIS and WFC3 as part of the Hubble Panchromatic
   Comparative Exoplanet Treasury (PanCET) program, and we combine those
   data with warm Spitzer transit observations. We extract transit depths
   from each of the data sets, presenting the STIS transit spectrum
   (0.29-0.93 mu m) for the first time. We retrieve the transit spectrum
   both with a free-chemistry retrieval suite (AURA) and a complementary
   chemical equilibrium retrieval suite (PLATON) to constrain the
   atmospheric properties at the day-night terminator. Both methods provide
   an excellent fit to the observed spectrum. Both AURA and PLATON retrieve
   a metal-rich atmosphere for almost all model assumptions (most likely
   O/H ratio of log10 Z/Z(circle dot) = 1.46(-0.68)(+0.53) and log10
   Z/Z(circle dot) = 2.33(-0.25)(+0.23), respectively); this is driven by a
   4.9 sigma detection of H2O as well as evidence of gas absorption in the
   optical (>2.7 sigma detection) due to Na, AlO, and/or VO/TiO, though no
   individual species is strongly detected. Both retrievals determine the
   transit spectrum to be consistent with a clear atmosphere, with no
   evidence of haze or high-altitude clouds. Interior modeling constraints
   on the maximum atmospheric metallicity (log10 Z/Z(circle dot) < 1.7)
   favor the AURA results. The inferred elemental oxygen abundance suggests
   that HAT-P-41b has one of the most metal-rich atmospheres of any hot
   Jupiters known to date. Overall, the inferred high metallicity and high
   inflation make HAT-P-41b an interesting test case for planet formation
   theories.},

Journal = AJ,

Abstract = {Rotational transitions in vibrationally excited AlO and TiO-two possible
   precursors of dust-were observed in the 300.GHz range (1 mm wavelength)
   toward the oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars R.Dor and
   IK.Tau with ALMA, and vibrationally excited AlO was observed toward the
   red supergiant VY.CMa with the SMA. The J.=.11. 10 transition of TiO in
   the v.=.1 and 2 levels and the N.=.9. 8 transition in the v.=.2 level of
   AlO were identified toward R.Dor, the J.=.11. 10 line of TiO was
   identified in the v.=.1 level toward IK.Tau, and two transitions in the
   v.=.1 and 2 levels of AlO were identified toward VY.CMa. The newly
   derived high vibrational temperature of TiO and AlO in R.Dor of
   1800.+/-.200.K and prior measurements of the angular extent confirm that
   the majority of the emission is from a region within.2Ra of the central
   star. A full radiative transfer analysis of AlO in R.Dor yielded a
   fractional abundance of similar to 3\% of the solar abundance of Al.
   From a similar analysis of TiO a fractional abundance of similar to 78\%
   of the solar abundance of Ti was found. The observations provide
   indirect evidence that TiO is present in a rotating disk close to the
   star. Further observations in the ground and excited vibrational levels
   are needed to determine whether AlO, TiO, and TiO2 are seeds of the
   Al2O(3) dust in R.Dor, and perhaps in the gravitationally bound dust
   shells in other AGB stars with low mass-loss rates.},

Title = {{An Unusual Transmission Spectrum for the Sub-Saturn KELT-11b Suggestive
   of a Subsolar Water Abundance}},
Journal = AJ,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {160},
pages = {280},
Abstract = {We present an optical-to-infrared transmission spectrum of the inflated
   sub-Saturn KELT-11b measured with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
   Satellite (TESS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3
   G141 spectroscopic grism, and the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) at
   3.6 mu m, in addition to a Spitzer 4.5 mu m secondary eclipse. The
   precise HST transmission spectrum notably reveals a low-amplitude water
   feature with an unusual shape. Based on free-retrieval analyses with
   varying molecular abundances, we find strong evidence for water
   absorption. Depending on model assumptions, we also find tentative
   evidence for other absorbers (HCN, TiO, and AlO). The retrieved water
   abundance is generally less than or similar to 0.1x solar (0.001-0.7x
   solar over a range of model assumptions), several orders of magnitude
   lower than expected from planet formation models based on the solar
   system metallicity trend. We also consider chemical-equilibrium and
   self-consistent 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model fits and find
   that they, too, prefer low metallicities ({[}M/H] less than or similar
   to -2, consistent with the free-retrieval results). However, all of the
   retrievals should be interpreted with some caution because they either
   require additional absorbers that are far out of chemical equilibrium to
   explain the shape of the spectrum or are simply poor fits to the data.
   Finally, we find that the Spitzer secondary eclipse is indicative of
   full heat redistribution from KELT-11b's dayside to nightside, assuming
   a clear dayside. These potentially unusual results for KELT-11b's
   composition are suggestive of new challenges on the horizon for
   atmosphere and formation models in the face of increasingly precise
   measurements of exoplanet spectra.},

Journal = ApJL,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {902},
pages ={L19},
Abstract = {For solar system objects, ultraviolet spectroscopy has been critical in
   identifying sources of stratospheric heating and measuring the
   abundances of a variety of hydrocarbon and sulfur-bearing species,
   produced via photochemical mechanisms, as well as oxygen and ozone. To
   date, fewer than 20 exoplanets have been probed in this critical
   wavelength range (0.2-0.4 mu m). Here we use data from Hubble's newly
   implemented WFC3 UVIS G280 grism to probe the atmosphere of the hot
   Jupiter HAT-P-41b in the ultraviolet through optical in combination with
   observations at infrared wavelengths. We analyze and interpret
   HAT-P-41b's 0.2-5.0 mu m transmission spectrum using a broad range of
   methodologies including multiple treatments of data systematics as well
   as comparisons with atmospheric forward, cloud microphysical, and
   multiple atmospheric retrieval models. Although some analysis and
   interpretation methods favor the presence of clouds or potentially a
   combination of Na, VO, AlO, and CrH to explain the ultraviolet through
   optical portions of HAT-P-41b's transmission spectrum, we find that the
   presence of a significant H- opacity provides the most robust
   explanation. We obtain a constraint for the abundance of H-, log(H-) =
   -8.65 +/- 0.62, in HAT-P-41b's atmosphere, which is several orders of
   magnitude larger than predictions from equilibrium chemistry for a
   similar to 1700-1950 K hot Jupiter. We show that a combination of
   photochemical and collisional processes on hot hydrogen-dominated
   exoplanets can readily supply the necessary amount of H- and suggest
   that such processes are at work in HAT-P-41b and the atmospheres of many
   other hot Jupiters.},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {485},
Pages = {5817-5830},
Abstract = {Thermal emission spectra of hot Jupiters have led to key constraints on
   thermal inversions (or `stratospheres') in their atmospheres with
   important implications for their atmospheric processes. Canonically,
   thermal inversions in hot Jupiters have been suggested to be caused by
   species such as TiO and VO which have strong visible opacity to absorb
   incident starlight. We explore two new avenues for thermal inversions in
   hot Jupiters, exploring both the visible and infrared opacities in their
   atmospheres. First, by exploring a range of metal-rich species we find
   that four species (AlO, CaO, NaH, and MgH) provide visible opacities
   comparable to TiO/VO and can cause strong inversions with reasonable
   abundances. Secondly, we show that a low infrared opacity caused by a
   low H2O abundance, e.g. through a C/O similar to 1, can also lead to
   strong thermal inversions even with low abundances of the visible
   absorbers mentioned above. We find that increasing the C/O ratio towards
   unity requires almost 2 orders of magnitude lower abundances for the
   visible absorbers in order for an inversion to form. Finally, we explore
   the thermal inversion inWASP-121b and find that it can be explained by
   all the visible absorbers listed above for different C/O ratios. Our
   study demonstrates the importance of both the refractory and volatile
   species in governing the physicochemical processes in hot Jupiter
   atmospheres. Spectroscopic observations in the visible have the
   potential to detect the newly proposed refractory species that can cause
   thermal inversions in addition to TiO and VO.},

   First indication of aluminum oxide in an exoplanet}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {622},
pages = {A71},
Abstract = {There has been increasing progress toward detailed characterization of
   exoplanetary atmospheres, in both observations and theoretical methods.
   Improvements in observational facilities and data reduction and analysis
   techniques are enabling increasingly higher quality spectra, especially
   from ground-based facilities. The high data quality also necessitates
   concomitant improvements in models required to interpret such data. In
   particular, the detection of trace species such as metal oxides has been
   challenging. Extremely irradiated exo-planets (similar to 3000 K) are
   expected to show oxides with strong absorption signals in the optical.
   However, there are only a few hot Jupiters where such signatures have
   been reported. Here we aim to characterize the atmosphere of the
   ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33 b using two primary transits taken 18 orbits
   apart. Our atmospheric retrieval, performed on the combined data sets,
   provides initial constraints on the atmospheric composition of WASP-33
   b. We report a possible indication of aluminum oxide (AlO) at 3.3-sigma
   significance. The data were obtained with the long slit OSIRIS
   spectrograph mounted at the 10-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We cleaned
   the brightness variations from the light curves produced by stellar
   pulsations, and we determined the wavelength-dependent variability of
   the planetary radius caused by the atmospheric absorption of stellar
   light. A simultaneous fit to the two transit light curves allowed us to
   refine the transit parameters, and the common wavelength coverage
   between the two transits served to contrast our results. Future
   observations with HST as well as other large ground-based facilities
   will be able to further constrain the atmospheric chemical composition
   of the planet.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {37-48},
Abstract = {In this work, we report the potential energy curves for the X-2 Pi,
   A(2)Sigma(+), B-2 Sigma(+), G(2)Delta, G'(2)Sigma(-), C-2 Pi, and D-2
   Sigma(+) states of the AlO radical and the transition dipole moments
   between these states. The calculations are performed with the complete
   active space selfconsistent field method, followed by the valence
   internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach
   under the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that
   the rotationless radiative lifetimes are in the order of several hundred
   ns for the B-2 Sigma(+) state, several tens of ns for the C-2 Pi state,
   and several to more than ten ns for the first well of the D-2 Sigma(+)
   state. These lifetimes indicate that the transitions originated from
   these states easily occur. The rotationless radiative lifetimes are
   several to several hundred mu s for the G(2)Delta and G'(2)Sigma(-)
   states, and in the order of 10 to 100 mu s for the A(2)Sigma(+) state.
   The Einstein coefficients of emissions from the B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2
   Sigma(+), C-2 Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) and C-2 Pi-A(2)Pi systems, as well as from
   the first well of the D-2 Sigma(+) state to the X-2 Sigma(+) and A(2)Pi
   states are very large, suggesting that the transitions from these
   systems should be able to be measured readily via spectroscopy. The
   rovibrational constants are first obtained from the analytic potential
   by numerically solving the rovibrational Schrodinger equation, and then
   the spectroscopic parameters are evaluated by fitting the vibrational
   levels. The distributions of the intensity and wavelength of the
   spectral transitions are new. The radiative lifetimes reported in this
   work are also new for all vibrational levels of the C-2 Pi, G(2)Delta
   and G'(2)Sigma(-) states, as well as for upsilon >= 1 levels of the C-2
   Pi state. The results reported in this study can be used to detect the
   (AlO)-Al-26-O-16 radical in outer space.},

Abstract = {The long pulse ablation of aluminum wafers in ambient air using an Er:
   YAG laser at 2.94 mu m wavelength is presented. Visible emission spectra
   collected during ablation are assigned to the B-2 Sigma(+) -> X-2
   Sigma(+) molecular electronic transition of aluminum monoxide (AlO). A
   rovibronic model including self-absorption within the plume is developed
   to determine the molecular temperature. For a 60.2 mu s pulse at a
   fluence of 249.92 +/- 40 J/cm(2), a temperature of 2843 +/- 32 K and
   3013 +/- 30 K was found with the linear and nonlinear models,
   respectively. A greybody background with an emissivity of approximately
   1.3 x 10(-6) was observed, implying a low-volume mixing fraction of
   particulates in the plume. A linear fit of the Delta nu = -1 sequence
   was developed to rapidly analyze hundreds of spectra taken as background
   pressure was varied from 400 to 1000 mbar. The AlO temperature is
   approximately independent of background pressure. Finally, comparisons
   to other laser ablation studies at shorter wavelengths and shorter pulse
   durations are made wherever possible.},

Title = {{Search for aluminium monoxide in the winds of oxygen-rich AGB stars}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2017},
Volume = {598},
pages = {A53},
Abstract = {Context. Aluminium monoxide (AlO) is likely efficiently depleted from
   the gas around oxygen-rich evolved stars to form alumina (Al2O3)
   clusters and dust seeds. The presence of AlO gas in the extended
   atmospheres of evolved stars has been derived from optical spectroscopy.
   More recently, AlO gas was also detected at long wavelengths around the
   supergiant VY CMa and the oxygenrich asymptotic giant branch star o Cet
   (Mira A). The central role aluminium might play in dust formation and
   wind driving, in combination with these first detections of AlO at long
   wavelengths, shows the need for a wider search for this molecule in the
   winds of evolved stars.
   Aims. The detection at long wavelengths of emission in rotational
   transitions of AlO towards asymptotic giant branch stars can help
   constrain the presence and location of AlO gas in the outflows and
   ultimately also the efficiency of the depletion process.
   Methods. In search of AlO, we mined data obtained with APEX, the IRAM
   30m telescope, Herschel / HIFI, SMA, and ALMA, which were primarily
   aimed at studying other species around asymptotic giant branch stars. We
   report here on observations of AlO towards a sample of eight oxygen-rich
   asymptotic giant branch stars in different rotational transitions, up to
   seven for some stars. Results. We present definite detections of one
   rotational transition of AlO for o Cet and R Aqr, and tentative
   detections of one transition for R Dor and o Cet and two transitions for
   IK Tau and W Hya. The presented spectra of WX Psc, R Cas, and TX Cam
   show no signature of AlO. For o Cet, R Aqr, and IK Tau, we find that the
   AlO (N = 9 8) emission likely traces the inner parts of the wind, out to
   only a few tens of AU, where the gas has not yet been accelerated to its
   terminal velocity. This is in agreement with recently published results
   from a detailed study on o Cet.
   Conclusions. The conclusive detections of AlO emission in the case of o
   Cet and R Aqr confirm the presence of AlO in the gas phase in outflows
   of asymptotic giant branch stars. The tentative detections further
   support this. Since most of the observations presented in this study
   were obtained with stronger emission from other species than AlO in
   mind, observations with higher sensitivity in combination with high
   angular resolution will improve our understanding of the presence and
   behaviour of AlO. From the current data sets we cannot firmly conclude
   whether there is a direct correlation between the wind properties and
   the detection rate of AlO emission. We hope that this study can serve as
   a stimulus to perform sample studies in search of AlO in oxygen-rich
   outflows.},

spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) are applied to a flat flame stabilized
in a suspension of micron-sized aluminum. The results from the combination of diagnostics
are used to infer the combustion regime of the particles and to estimate the characteristic
combustion time of the suspension. It is observed that the reaction zone of the flame
in stoichiometric aluminum–air suspensions exhibits strong self-reversal of the atomic
aluminum emission lines. These lines also exhibit high optical depths in both emission
and absorption spectroscopy. The strong self-reversal and high optical depths indicate high
concentrations of aluminum vapor within the reaction zone of the flame at multiple temperatures.
These features provide evidence of the formation of vapor-phase micro-diffusion flames around the
individual particles in the suspension. In aluminum–methane–air flames, the lack of self-reversal
and lower optical depths of the aluminum atomic lines indicate the absence of vapor-phase
micro-diffusion flames, and point to a more heterogeneous, and likely kinetically-controlled,
particle combustion regime. The reaction zone thickness is estimated from the spatially resolved
profiles of aluminum resonance lines in both absorption and emission through the flame.
The emission measurements yield a reaction zone thickness on the order of 1.7±0.3 mm in
aluminum–air flames, and the absorption measurements yield a thickness on the order of 2.3±0.5.
It is demonstrated that the combination of the combustion zone thickness measurement, flame
temperatures determined from molecular AlO emission spectra, and particle velocity measurements
from the \{PIV\} diagnostic permits an estimation of the burning time in the suspension.
The burning time in stoichiometric aluminum–air suspensions using the suite of diagnostics
is estimated to be on the order of 0.7 ms.}

Abstract = {Experimental investigations into the characteristics of laser-induced

   following laser ablation of aluminum, graphite and laser-sparked air are
   examined as they relate to those observed following detonation of high

   spectroscopy (LIBS) reliably correlates reactions involving atomic Al
   and aluminum monoxide (AlO) with respect to both emission spectra and
   temperatures, as compared to small-and large-scale high-explosive
   detonations. Atomic Al and AlO resulting from laser ablation and a cited

   of the ablating laser's focus was altered relative to the surface of the

Journal = {Anal. Chem.},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {7750-7757},
Abstract = {Recently, laser ablated molecular isotopic spectrometry (LAMIS) has
   expanded its capability to explore molecules formation mechanism in
   laser-induced plasma in addition to isotope analysis. LAMIS is a
   powerful tool for tracking the origination of atoms that is involved in
   formation of investigated molecules by labeling atoms with their
   isotopic substitution. The evolutionary formation pathways of organic
   molecules, especially of C-2 dimers and CN radicals, were frequently
   reported. However, very little is known about the formation pathways for
   metallic radicals and heterodimers in laser ablated plasma. This
   research focuses on elucidating the formation pathways of AlO radicals
   in femtosecond laser ablated plasma from O-18-labeled Al2O3 pellet.
   Plasmas expanding with strong forward bias in the direction normal to
   the sample surface were generated in the wake of a weakly ionized
   channel created by a femtosecond laser. The formation mechanism of AlO
   and influence of air were investigated with multiple plasma diagnostic
   methods such as monochromatic fast gating imaging, spatiotemporal
   resolved optical emission spectroscopy, and LAMIS. An advanced LAMIS
   fitting procedure was used to deduce the spatiotemporal distributions of
   (AlO)-O-18 and (AlO)-O-16 number densities and also their ratios. We
   found that the (AlO)-O-16/(AlO)-O-18 number density ratio is higher for
   plasma portion closer to the sample surface, which suggests that
   chemical reactions between the plasma plume and ambient air are more
   intense at the tail of the plasma. The results also reveals that direct
   association of free Al and O atoms is the main mechanism for the
   formation of AlO at the early stage of the plasma. To the contrast,
   chemical reactions between plasma materials and ambient oxygen molecules
   and the isotope exchange effect are the dominant mechanisms of the
   formation of AlO and evolution of (AlO)-O-16/(AlO)-O-18 number density
   ratio at the late stage of the plasma.},

   the emission intensity was illustrated by several examples of both
   atomic (Ca, Na) and molecular (OH, AlO, CaF) emission in LIBS and LAMIS,

Journal = AA,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {592},
pages = {A42},
Abstract = {Context. Dust is efficiently produced by cool giant stars, but the
   condensation of inorganic dust is poorly understood. Observations of key
   aluminum bearing molecules around evolved stars has enabled us to
   investigate the nucleation of alumina (Al2O3)dust in the gas.
   Aims. We aim to identify and characterize aluminum bearing species in
   the circumstellar gas of Mira (o Ceti) in order to elucidate their role
   in the production of Al2O3 dust.
   Methods. We used multiepoch spectral line observations at (sub-)
   millimeter, far-infrared, and optical wavelengths including: maps with
   ALMA that probe the gas distribution in the immediate vicinity of the
   star at similar to 30 mas; observations with ALMA, APEX, and Herschel in
   2013 2015 for studying cycle and inter-cycle variability of the
   rotational lines of Al-bearing molecules; optical records as far back as
   1965 to examine variations in electronic transitions over time spans of
   days to decades; and velocity measurements and excitation analysis of
   the spectral features that constrain the physical parameters of the gas.
   Results. Three diatomic molecules AlO, AlOH, and AlH, and atomic Al i
   are the main observable aluminum species in Mira, although a significant
   fraction of aluminum might reside in other species that have not yet
   been identified. Strong irregular variability in the (sub-) millimeter
   and optical features of AlO (possibly the direct precursor of Al2O3)
   indicates substantial changes in the excitation conditions, or varying
   abundance that is likely related to shocks in the star. The
   inhomogeneous distribution of AlO might influence the spatial and
   temporal characteristics of dust production.
   Conclusions. We are unable to quantitatively trace aluminum depletion
   from the gas, but the rich observational material constrains
   time-dependent chemical networks. Future improvements should include
   spectroscopic characterization of higher aluminum oxides, coordinated
   observations of dust and gas species at different variability phases,
   and tools to derive abundances in shock-excited gas.},

Journal = SCAB,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {193-200},
Abstract = {Measurements with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIES) usually
   take place in the atmospheric air. For quantitative analysis of metallic
   elements, oxidation may represent an important issue which can
   significantly modify the stoichiometry of the plasma. Molecule formation
   in plasma should be therefore studied and taken into account in the LIBS
   practice. In this work, we experimentally investigated the temporal
   evolution and transformation of the plasma induced on an aluminum target
   by a nanosecond infrared (1064 nm) laser in the atmospheric air, in
   terms of its temperatures over a large interval of time from hundreds of
   nanoseconds to tens of microseconds. Such evolution was then correlated
   to the temporal evolution of the emission intensity from AlO molecules
   in the ablation plume. In particular, for a given ablation laser pulse
   energy, the appearance of the molecular emission while the plume cools
   down allows determining a minimal delay, tau(min), which corresponds to
   a maximal value of the temperature, T-max, below which the molecular
   emission begins to be clearly observed and to grow as a function of the
   delay. Such delay or such temperature indicates the longest delay or the
   lowest temperature for laser-induced plasma to be suitable for a correct
   analysis of metallic elements without significant influence of the
   alternation of the stoichiometry by oxidation. In our experiment, the
   values of tau(min), and T-max have been determined for a range of
   ablation laser pulse energies from 5 rill to 50 mJ. These values lie
   respectively in the range of 3 to 15 mu s for tau(min), and 4500 K to
   6600 K in terms of the molecule temperature for T-max. Beyond the
   practical interest for LIBS, our results provide also insights to the
   kinetics of the AlO molecule formation in laser-induced plasma.},

   X(2)Sigma(+) band systems of AlO, involving 21,500 line assignments, has

   gamma values of the B(2)Sigma(+) state are questionable. The present
   analysis shows that gamma(B(2)Sigma(+))approximate to 0.014 cm(-1),
   essentially independent of the vibrational level. The positive sign is
   consistent with second order interaction with the higher-lying C(2)Pi(r)
   and lower-lying A(2)Pi(i) states. It also appears that many of the
   previously reported gamma and gamma(D) values of X(2)Sigma(+) (v > 0)
   are doubtful. In fact, gamma(X(2)Sigma(+)) is observed to become
   increasingly negative for v `' > 1, due to second order interaction with
   the low-lying A(2)Pi(i) state. The present results are based on models
   where the hyperfine structure of the (2)Sigma(+) states has been taken
   into account explicitly. Intensity patterns of the branches of the
   B(2)Sigma(+) -> X(2)Sigma(+) system have been shown to be influenced by
   the case b beta(s) coupling in the ground state v = 0,1 levels. This
   gives rise to intensity differences of around 10 percent in the

Abstract = {A new circumstellar molecule, the radical AlO (X (2)Sigma(+)), has been
   detected toward the envelope of the oxygen-rich supergiant star VY Canis
   Majoris (VY CMa) using the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). The N = 7 ->

   observed at 1 mm using the ARO Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) and the N =
   4 -> 3 line was detected at 2 mm using the ARO 12 m telescope. Based on
   the shape of the line profiles, AlO most likely arises from the
   dust-forming region in the spherical outflow of VY CMa, as opposed to
   the blue or redshifted winds, with a source size of theta(s) similar to
   0.'' 5. Given this source size, the column density of AlO was found to
   be N(tot) similar to 2 x 10(15) cm(-2) for T(rot) similar to 230 K, with
   a fractional abundance, relative to H(2), of similar to 10(-8).
   Gas-phase thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry is the likely formation
   mechanism for AlO in VY CMa, but either shocks disrupt the condensation
   process into Al(2)O(3), or chemical ``freezeout{''} occurs. The species
   therefore survives further into the circumstellar envelope to a radius
   of r similar to 20 R({*}). The detection of AlO in VY CMa is additional
   evidence of an active gas-phase refractory chemistry in oxygen-rich
   envelopes, and suggests such objects may be fruitful sources for other
   new oxide identifications.},

Pages = {258-269},
Abstract = {Theoretical evaluations of g-tensors have seen noticeable progress in
   recent years. Promising results in agreement with experiment have been
   reported especially for small systems. However, the diatomic molecule
   AlO has proved to be a difficult test case. In contradiction to common
   understanding, the g-tensor of this system is strongly dependent on the
   internuclear distance. The vicinity of the first excited state A(2)Pi to
   the ground state X-2 Sigma(+) and their potential energy curve crossing
   close to the equilibrium distance contraindicate strongly the
   application of a conventional perturbation approach. Using a diabatic
   representation of the lowest electronic states, a vibrationally averaged
   value for Delta g(perpendicular to)(v = 0) = -608 ppm is obtained. The
   non-negligible contribution of high-lying excited states to the g-tensor
   indicate that a sum-over-states calculation is difficult to converge.
   Translating the ground state potential energy curve as to reproduce the
   relative position inferred from experiment and including higher (2)Pi

Abstract = {The eruption of V4332 Sgr discovered in February 1994 shows striking
   similarities to that of V838 Mon started in January 2002. The nature of
   these eruptions is, however, enigmatic and unclear. We present new
   photometric and spectroscopic data on V4332 Sgr obtained in April-May
   2003 at the SAAO. The obtained spectrum shows an unusual emission-line
   component superimposed on an early M-type stellar spectrum. The
   emission-line spectrum is of very low excitation and is dominated by
   lines from neutral elemets ( NaI, FeI, CaI) and molecular bands ( TiO,
   ScO, AlO). We also analyse all the observational data, mainly
   photometric measurements, available for V4332 Sgr. This allows us to
   follow the evolution of the effective temperature, radius and luminosity
   of the object since February 1994 till 2003. We show that the observed
   decline of V4332 Sgr can be accounted for by a gravitational contraction
   of an inflated stellar envelope. The combined optical and infrared
   photometry in 2003 shows that apart from the M-type stellar component
   there is a strong infrared excess in the KLM bands. This excess was
   absent in the 2MASS measurements done in 1998 but was probably starting
   to appear in K in 1999 when the object was observed in the DENIS survey.
   We interpret the results in terms of a stellar merger scenario proposed
   by Soker \& Tylenda. The infrared excess is likely to be due to a
   disc-like structure which is either of protostellar nature or has been
   produced during the 1994 eruption and stores angular momentum from the
   merger event.},

Title = {{Rare gas effects on hyperfine coupling constants of BO, AlO, and GaO}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {9270-9278},
Abstract = {Using density functional theory methods and large basis sets, we
   calculated hyperfine coupling constants (HFCCs) for the B-11, O-17,
   Al-27, and Ga-69 nuclei of the radicals BO, AlO, and GaO (XO), embedded
   in 2-14 rare gas (Rg) Ne and Ar atoms. Kr atoms were included for AlO.
   The distance of the Rg atoms from XO was varied from 4 to 12 bohr.
   Matrix effects cause A(iso)(X) to increase, accompanied by decreases in
   A(dip)(X) and A(dip)(O), while A(iso)(O) remains close to zero. Changes
   are largest for AlO, slightly smaller for GaO, and very small for BO, in
   line with the molecular polarizabilities. Observed changes of A(iso)(X)
   and A(dip)(X) for BO in Ne matrixes and for AlO in Ne, Ar, and Kr
   matrixes are reproduced in complexes with 12 Rg atoms at distances of
   5-6 bohr or 14 Rg atoms at distances of 6-7 bohr. For GaO, experimental
   data are available only in Ne matrixes. Theoretical results obtained for
   HFCCs of O-17 could not be verified due to insufficient experimental
   information. Estimates of HFCCs in matrixes not yet experimentally
   studied and for GaO in the gas phase have been made. Due to the
   interaction with rare gas atoms, p-spin density on the X and O atoms of
   XO is converted into s-spin density on X, thereby causing an increase
   (in magnitude) of A(iso)(X), accompanied by decreases in A(dip) of X and
   O. The higher polarizability of XO along the bond axis is reflected in
   complexes that have axial Rg atoms showing larger changes in HFCCs than
   comparable complexes without axial Rg atoms.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {610},
Pages = {L29-L32},
Abstract = {We have searched for the important radioactive isotope Al-26 in the
   nova-like source V4332 Sgr. Recent results from gamma-ray astronomy show
   that there is pervasive emission of the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray photon,
   arising from the decay of Al-26 to Mg-26, from all over the Galactic
   plane. Although the sites from where this emission originates are not
   clearly established, novae are believed to be an important contributing
   source. In this context, V4332 Sgr presented a rare opportunity to
   observationally investigate whether novae or nova-like sources
   synthesize Al-26 and to what extent. Strong AlO bands in the near-IR
   have been reported in this object recently. As molecular bands of
   different isotopic compositions are readily resolved spectroscopically
   (e.g., (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13), it was thought that the components of
   AlO associated with Al-26 and stable Al-27 could be detected as separate
   bands. Our spectra indicate that there is no strong presence of Al-26 in
   V4332 Sgr. A reliable upper limit of 0.10 for the Al-26/Al-27 ratio is
   determined, which constitutes the first observational constraint for
   this ratio in a potential Al-26-producing source. While V4332 Sgr is not
   a typical nova, its outburst amplitude and light-curve behavior bear
   close similarity to that of novae. Hence, although the results from
   V4332 Sgr cannot be directly extended to novae in general, the limit on
   the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio could be a useful input in constraining
   rather uncertain nucleosynthesis models for the production of Al-26 in
   novae/nova-like sources. When we compare the observed Al-26/Al-27 ratio
   in V4332 Sgr with that expected in classical novae, it appears unlikely
   that the progenitor of V4332 Sgr is an oxygen-neon-magnesium white
   dwarf.},

   for AlN- and AlP-, which have positive agi values (1400 and 10 000 ppm)
   due to the quasi-degeneracy X(2)Sigma (+)/1(2)Pi (i). The

   contributes positively for most radicals but negatively for the boron
   series BO, BN-, BS, and BP-. Experimental g shifts, which are available

   the Deltag values calculated at R,. However, for radicals having a very
   low-lying 1(2)Pi (i) state, such as AlN- and AlP-, our study suggests

   The agreement is fair for AlCl2. Major revisions to the recommended
   thermochemistry must be considered for OAlCl, OAlH, OAlOH, and AlC. This
   is not surprising since the thermodynamic data for OAlCl, OAlN, OAlOH,

   thermochemical data are also presented for several species never studied

   weak Al+ lines and very weak molecular features, among which bandheads
   of the Delta nu = 0, +/-1, +/-2 sequences of the AlO B(2)Sigma

   distribution of the AlO B state, determined by simulation of the B-X

   (GaO)-O-16,17, and (InO)-O-16,17 isolated in neon matrices at 4 K.
   Except for (AlO)-O-16, no previous ESR measurements have been reported
   for these X (2) Sigma diatomic radicals. The pulsed laser vaporization
   of the metals in the presence of O-16(2) and O-17(2) produced high
   quality ESR spectra of these metal oxide radicals whose nuclear
   hyperfine interactions (A tensors) were fully resolved for both the
   metal and oxygen nuclei. An analysis of the experimental spin densities
   in combination with different types of theoretical calculations provided
   detailed information concerning the electronic structure trends going
   down this metal oxide group. Increased p-orbital spin density on oxygen
   was observed for the heavier metal oxide radicals. Nonrelativistic ab
   initio calculations with an extended basis set and the UB3LYP method
   reproduced the trends in the isotropic and dipolar hyperfine
   interactions. All-electron CI calculations, restricted open-shell
   Hartree-Fock (ROHF) wave functions, and unrestricted Hartree-Fock wave
   functions gave results very different from experiment and from each
   other for the isotropic interaction. All calculations were in fair
   agreement with each other for the dipolar interaction and provided an
   assignment of the sign for that term. (C) 1997 American Institute of

Abstract = {The infrared A2PI(i)-X2SIGMA+ band system of AlO has been recorded with
   Fourier transform techniques using an electrodeless 2450-MHz discharge
   as a source.  Transitions involving upsilon = 0-3 of X2SIGMA+ and
   upsilon = 0-10 of A2PI(i) have been observed.  Local perturbations
   affect the different levels of the A2PI(i) state, and all these
   perturbations are shown to be caused by vibrational levels of the
   X2SIGMA+ state.  Extra lines originating from the nominal upsilon = 7, 8
   levels of X2SIGMA+ are observed in the proximity of the A2PI(i) (upsilon
   = 2) <-> X2SIGMA+ (upsilon = 7) and A2PI(i) (upsilon = 3) <-> X2SIGMA+
   (upsilon = 8) crossings.  In total, data from 23 vibrational bands are
   included in the analysis.  The spin splittings of the X2SIGMA+ state are
   strongly dependent of upsilon''.  The X2SIGMA+ state also shows clearly
   noticeable nuclear hyperfine effects, manifested by numerous
   hyperfine-induced DELTAJ = +/-2 branches.  A global deperturbation has
   been performed for upsilon = 0-8 of A2PI(i) and for the corresponding
   intersecting levels upsilon = 5-11 of X2SIGMA+.  The X2SIGMA+ state has
   been fitted both with and without hyperfine parameters.  The inclusion
   of the hyperfine interaction was found to be necessary in order to
   describe the X2SIGMA+ ground state adequately.  The anomalous intensity
   distributions among branches terminating at different vibrational levels
   of the X2SIGMA+ state are discussed.  The strong B2SIGMA+-X2SIGMA+
   system has been recorded with FTS techniques, and the contradictory

molecule line positions in the A2Πi - X2∑+ system are tentatively proposed.
Indeed, the available data on the C2Πr → X2∑+ and C2Πr → A2Πi transitions permit
us to derive about 2400 energy level differences in the A-X system corresponding
to the six ν-connected bands 0-0, 0-1, 0-2, 1-0, 1-1 and 1-2. A unique and consistent
set of rovibrational constants is derived from a global fitting, allowing to reproduce
the observed differences with a total standard deviation of 0.053 cm-1. A catalogue
of vacuum line wavenumbers in the six bands is generated and can be made available
on request. The synthetic spectra are expected to represent properly the true spectra
at least up to J ~ 35.5 and can therefore be of usefulness for the detection of the
system in the spectra of M giant- and Mira-type stars. Franck-Condon factors and
r-centroïds appropriate to RKR potentials and estimates of intensities in emission

abstract = {Eighteen bands of the Delta v=+4, +3 and -2 sequences of the
B 2 Sigma +-X 2 Sigma + system of AlO have been photographed at high resolution
and analysed for the rotational structure. It has been found that the spin-doubling
constant gamma in the X 2 Sigma + state increases very rapidly with the vibrational
quantum number v, while in the B state it remains almost constant and does not change
with v. Also, the spin doubling in the v"=4, 5, 6 and 7 levels of the X 2 Sigma + state
is not simply a linear function of N as found by earlier workers. It is found
necessary to include a cubic term in N in the formula for the observed spin doubling
in the X 2 Sigma + state. The unusual increase in the spin doubling is attributed
to the proximity and the interactions of the vibrational levels of the A 2 Pi i
state with the vibrational levels of the X 2 Sigma + state.},

ɛrel (radiation per unit volume) of the AlO B2 Σ → 2Σ system at 4842 Å and the gas
temperature of the decaying plasma are recorded in terms of a laboratory time scale.

as well as the vibrational relaxation of AlO during its formation are considered

Abstract = {SCF calculations using an extended double-zeta basis set have been
   performed in order to obtain information about the energy spectrum of
   AlO. The variational calculations concerned six states of AlO and three
   states of AlO+. Correlation energy differences were estimated
   semiempirically to correct the single-configuration approximation. The
   predominant configurations of the observed states of AlO have been
   identified by using a comparison between the calculated and observed
   spectroscopic elements: term values, rotational, vibrational and
   spin-orbit constants, compatibility of observed systems. This has led us
   to deduce the probable locations of as yet unobserved states and to
   predict the wavelength of a number of transitions in which they are
   involved. The ground state of AlO+ has been found to be stable but its
   symmetry ((3)Pi or (1)Sigma(+)) could not be ascertained. Particular
   emphasis has been laid on a study of the (2 pi(3) 6 sigma(2) 7o3 pi)
   configuration or the highest-lying observed states of AlO. D-2 Sigma(+)
   and E-2 Delta(j). It is suggested that the quartet levels of this
   configuration are responsible for the perturbations experimentally found
   in C-2 Pi(I). The predissociation observed for E-2 Delta(i) is finally
   discussed in terms of avoided crossings of potential curves.},
