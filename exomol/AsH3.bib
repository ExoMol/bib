Abstract = {{An analysis of the ground state of arsine is performed by using all the
   line assignments coming from a recent investigation of the vibrational
   system 2 nu(2)/nu(2) + nu(4)/2 nu(4)/nu(1)/nu(3) at 1650-2350 cm(-1). A
   set of 6837 ground state combination differences is used, in combination
   with all FIR and radio-wave and microwave data (RMW) available in the
   literature, to refine the ground state parameters. The rotational model
   takes into account all the nondiagonal contributions in
   {[}K\textbackslash{}K +/- 3] and {[}K\textbackslash{}K +/- 6], which are
   calculated via diagonalization, as well as the hyperfine interactions.
   The best estimates of the ground state parameters include 12 rotational
   and 4 quadrupole parameters. The overall rms deviation of the fit is
   0.225 MHz for 7142 data fitted. The deviations for IR, FIR, and RMW data
   separately, are 0.329 x 10(-3) cm(-1), 0.279 x 10(-3) cm(-1), and 0.149
   MHz, compared to average experimental uncertainties estimated to 0.5 x
   10(-3) cm(-1), 0.2 x 10(-3) cm(-1) and 0.211 MHz for the three kinds of
   data, respectively. The parameters are compared to previous results and
   used for a prediction of the ground state energies up to J = 20,
   including hyperfine structure. A list including calculated line
   frequencies and intensities for all the ground state rotational
   transitions obeying either Delta J = 1,
   Delta\textbackslash{}K\textbackslash{} = 0, Delta F = 0, +/- 1, or Delta
   J = 0, Delta\textbackslash{}K\textbackslash{} = 0, +/- 3, Delta F = 0,
   +/- 1, is also produced up to J = 20. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.}},
