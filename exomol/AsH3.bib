Abstract = {{We demonstrate the influence of the arsine partial pressure (p(AsH3)) on
   the quality of a GaAs layer grown on Ge substrate by metal organic
   chemical vapor deposition. The GaAs quality improves with p (AsH3) used
   during the 100 nm thick GaAs buffer layer. By growing a GaAs buffer
   layer at 630 degrees C with p (AsH3) of 5 mbar, we obtain a smooth GaAs
   layer with a root mean square roughness of 4.7 angstrom. This GaAs layer
   does not contain anti phase boundaries. With these optimized growth
   parameters, we fabricate a virtual GaAs substrate on a 200 mm silicon
   wafer as a first step towards the integration of III-V devices on
   silicon. }},

Journal = {Atmos. Environ.},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {1901-1907},
Abstract = {{Semiconductor and opto-electronics industries use many chemicals
   including arsenics in manufacturing processes. Thus, the process vent
   stream contains toxic air pollutants including arsine and other arsenic
   compounds, and poses a potential source for the atmospheric arsenic.
   Limited data are published on arsenic risk assessment and work place
   condition for electronics industries. Moreover, as per our best
   knowledge there is no report available on arsenic pollution from the
   exhaust of semiconductor and opto-electronic industries. In this study,
   the total arsenic (arsenic compounds as arsenic in gaseous and
   particulate phase) concentration was measured in the flue gas of 20
   stacks of different semiconductor and opto-electronics facilities
   situated in Science Based Industrial Park (SBIP), Hsinchu, Taiwan during
   August-September 2002. Ambient concentration of particulate arsenic
   (arsenic compounds as arsenic) was measured at 15 sites of SBIP twice,
   i.e. in September and October 2002. The concentration of the total
   arsenic in the flue gas was from 0 to 55.92 mu g m(-3) with the emission
   rate from 0 to 0.1427 g h(-1) for the facilities. The ambient arsenic
   concentration was from 0 to 120 ng m(-3). The ambient air level goal
   (AALG) of arsenic compound is 4.6 x 10(-5) mu g m(-3), if the lifetime
   cancer probability (LCP) level is 1.0 x 10(-6). Based on simple risk
   assessment model, we used Industrial Source Complex Short Term 3
   (ISCST3) model to calculate the maximum ground level concentration and
   employed the value of AALG; the emission lit-nit of arsenic compounds
   from a factory was determined to be less than 1.0 x 10(-5) kg h(-1). On
   comparison, it was concluded that the arsenical emission of 11 out of 20
   facilities was higher than the limited value. (c) 2005 Published by

Abstract = {Pseudomorphic four-period GaAs0.978N0.022/GaAs0.78Sb0.22 type-II
   multiquantum well structures were grown on (100) GaAs substrates by
   metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy at 530 degrees C. The GaAs0.978N0.022
   layers were grown at a V/III ratio of 685 and N/V ratio of 0.96, whereas
   the GaAs0.78Sb0.22 was grown at a V/III ratio of 3.8 and Sb/V ratio of
   0.8. The superlattice peaks in the x-ray diffraction theta-2 theta scans
   around the (400) GaAs peak were fitted using a dynamical simulation
   model to determine layer thickness and alloy compositions. The GaAsN and
   GaAsSb thicknesses were similar to 8 nm and similar to 5 nm,
   respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained at 30 K
   and the PL peak energy was found to match the type-II transition energy
   obtained from a 10-band k center dot p model. Postgrowth annealing under
   arsine-H-2 with a N-2 cooldown was found to increase the low temperature
   PL intensity and result in the appearance of luminescence at room
   temperature. },
