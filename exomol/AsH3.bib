Title = {{Saturn's Atmosphere in Northern Summer Revealed by JWST/MIRI}},
Journal = JGRP,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {128},
Abstract = {Saturn's northern summertime hemisphere was mapped by JWST/Mid-Infrared
   Instrument (4.9-27.9 mu m) in November 2022, tracing the seasonal
   evolution of temperatures, aerosols, and chemical species in the 5 years
   since the end of the Cassini mission. The spectral region between
   reflected sunlight and thermal emission (5.1-6.8 mu m) is mapped for the
   first time, enabling retrievals of phosphine, ammonia, and water,
   alongside a system of two aerosol layers (an upper tropospheric haze p <
   0.3 bars, and a deeper cloud layer at 1-2 bars). Ammonia displays
   substantial equatorial enrichment, suggesting similar dynamical
   processes to those found in Jupiter's equatorial zone. Saturn's North
   Polar Stratospheric Vortex has warmed since 2017, entrained by westward
   winds at p < 10 mbar, and exhibits localized enhancements in several
   hydrocarbons. The strongest latitudinal temperature gradients are
   co-located with the peaks of the zonal winds, implying wind decay with
   altitude. Reflectivity contrasts at 5-6 mu m compare favorably with
   albedo contrasts observed by Hubble, and several discrete vortices are
   observed. A warm equatorial stratospheric band in 2022 is not consistent
   with a 15-year repeatability for the equatorial oscillation. A stacked
   system of windshear zones dominates Saturn's equatorial stratosphere,
   and implies a westward equatorial jet near 1-5 mbar at this epoch. Lower
   stratospheric temperatures, and local minima in the distributions of
   several hydrocarbons, imply low-latitude upwelling and a reversal of
   Saturn's interhemispheric circulation since equinox. Latitudinal
   distributions of stratospheric ethylene, benzene, methyl, and carbon
   dioxide are presented for the first time, and we report the first
   detection of propane bands in the 8-11 mu m region.},

   layer with a root mean square roughness of 4.7 angstrom. This GaAs layer
   does not contain anti phase boundaries. With these optimized growth
   parameters, we fabricate a virtual GaAs substrate on a 200 mm silicon
   wafer as a first step towards the integration of III-V devices on silicon.},

both of these values to −0.008 kcal mol−1 and 0.025 kcal mol−1, respectively, with the

abstract = {Cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS) has
demonstrated powerful potential for trace-gas detection based on its unique combination
of high bandwidth, rapid data acquisition, high sensitivity, and high resolution,

have been limited to proof-of-principle experiments or studies of fundamental
laboratory science. Here, we present the development of CE-DFCS towards an industrial
application—measuring impurities in arsine, an important process gas used in III–V
semiconductor compound manufacturing. A strongly absorbing background gas with an
extremely complex, congested, and broadband spectrum renders trace detection exceptionally
difficult, but the capabilities of CE-DFCS overcome this challenge and make it
possible to identify and quantify multiple spectral lines associated with water
impurities. Further, frequency combs allow easy access to new spectral regions
via efficient nonlinear optical processes. Here, we demonstrate detection of multiple
potential impurities across 1.75–1.95 μm (5710–5130 cm−1), with a single-channel
detection sensitivity (simultaneously over 2000 channels) of ∼4×10−8 cm−1 Hz−1/2

Journal = {Atmos. Environ.},
Year = {2006},

Pages = {1901-1907},
Abstract = {Semiconductor and opto-electronics industries use many chemicals
   including arsenics in manufacturing processes. Thus, the process vent
   stream contains toxic air pollutants including arsine and other arsenic
   compounds, and poses a potential source for the atmospheric arsenic.
   Limited data are published on arsenic risk assessment and work place
   condition for electronics industries. Moreover, as per our best
   knowledge there is no report available on arsenic pollution from the
   exhaust of semiconductor and opto-electronic industries. In this study,
   the total arsenic (arsenic compounds as arsenic in gaseous and
   particulate phase) concentration was measured in the flue gas of 20
   stacks of different semiconductor and opto-electronics facilities
   situated in Science Based Industrial Park (SBIP), Hsinchu, Taiwan during
   August-September 2002. Ambient concentration of particulate arsenic
   (arsenic compounds as arsenic) was measured at 15 sites of SBIP twice,
   i.e. in September and October 2002. The concentration of the total
   arsenic in the flue gas was from 0 to 55.92 mu g m(-3) with the emission
   rate from 0 to 0.1427 g h(-1) for the facilities. The ambient arsenic
   concentration was from 0 to 120 ng m(-3). The ambient air level goal
   (AALG) of arsenic compound is 4.6 x 10(-5) mu g m(-3), if the lifetime
   cancer probability (LCP) level is 1.0 x 10(-6). Based on simple risk
   assessment model, we used Industrial Source Complex Short Term 3
   (ISCST3) model to calculate the maximum ground level concentration and
   employed the value of AALG; the emission lit-nit of arsenic compounds
   from a factory was determined to be less than 1.0 x 10(-5) kg h(-1). On
   comparison, it was concluded that the arsenical emission of 11 out of 20
   facilities was higher than the limited value.},

that in previous work by Olson et al. A dyad system was used to account for the
strong Coriolis coupling between ν1 and ν3 induces, through a large element in Δ
(K − l3) = ±3, many perturbation-allowed transitions. Absolute intensities were
measured for 387 lines corresponding to 494 transitions of ν1 and ν3. Only 343
of these were retained for the intensity fit because of blendings. Band strengths
of ν1 and ν3 were estimated as 265.8 (8.6) and 737.5 (9.5) cm−2 atm−1 at 296 K,
respectively. The energy and intensity parameters thus derived were used to produce
a new prediction of line positions and intensities, much more reliable than those
previously available, for further planetary applications.},

abstract = {Inversion barriers for the group‐15 hydrides NH3, PH3, AsH3, SbH3
and BiH3 have been studied using ab initio self‐consistent‐field methods including
electron correlation and relativistic effects. A modified symmetric inversion
potential is introduced to describe the inversion from the minimum C3v arrangement
through the D3h transition state. Tunneling rates and frequencies are calculated
at the Hartree–Fock and Mo/ller–Plesset (MP2) level within the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin
approximation. At the MP2 level the calculated 0+/0− ν2 frequency splitting of the
vibronic ground state of NH3/ND3 (0.729 cm−1/0.041 cm−1) is in excellent agreement
with the experimental values (0.794 cm−1/0.053 cm−1). The tunneling rate for PH3
suggests that previously published values are wrong by orders of magnitude. Correlation
effects do not change the barriers significantly in accordance with Freed’s theorem.
This has been studied in more detail for BiH3 at the quadratic configuration‐interaction
(QCI) level. Relativistic effects increase the barrier height of BiH3 by 81.6 kJ/mol
at the QCI level. Nonrelativistic and relativistic extended Hückel calculations
suggest that the a1 highest occupied molecular orbital, which is antibonding to
the Bi 6s, relieves part of its antibonding character near equilibrium geometry
due to the relativistic radial contraction of the 6s orbital and hence increases
the barrier height. In the planar transition state this orbital is a nonbonding
a‘2. The increasing trend in barrier heights from NH3 to BiH3 can be explained
by a second‐order Jahn–Teller distortion of the trigonal planar geometry. Vibrational
frequencies are predicted for BiH3.},

The relative abundance of arsenic in these two planetary atmospheres follows the
same pattern found for phosphorous. This similarity may constrain models for the
incorporation of heavy elements into the gaseous envelopes of the outer planets.},

observations near 4.7 microns is reported. A strong broad absorption at the position
of the nu3 Q-branch of AsH3 and weaker features where the R(1) lines of the nu1
and nu3 bands occur are noted in this high-resolution spectral range. Comparison
with synthetic spectra derived from a model atmosphere indicates the following:
both the thermal emission and the reflected solar radiation contribute to Saturn's 5 micron
flux; the mole fraction of arsine is (2.4 + 1.4 or - 1.2) x 10 to the -9th in the
approx. 4 bar region (T about 200 K) from which the thermal emission originates;
AsH3 is 2.5 to 10 times less abundant in the upper troposphere (0.2-0.4 bar), a
possible consequence of UV photolysis. The current observation of arsine implies
upward transport from the 360 K region that is sufficiently rapid to inhibit
conversion reactions. A reanalysis of 5-micron spectroscopic observations of
Jupiter by Bjoraker, Larson, and Kunde (1986) indicated that arsine is much less
abundant on Jupiter (AsH3/H2 less than or roughly equal to 3 x 10 to the -10th)

unambiguous evidence for the presence of arsine, AsH3. The abundance of AsH3 appears
to be almost a factor of two higher in Saturn than in Jupiter. The observed enrichments
are consistent with the core instability model for the formation of giant planets.
Models of arsenic chemistry that predict strong depletions of AsH3 at temperatures
below 370 K are not consistent with the observations, suggesting that vertical
convection or perhaps some other mechanism inhibits depletion. Arsenic is the first
new element identified in a planetary atmosphere since germanium was found in Jupiter
