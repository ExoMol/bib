abstract = {Luminescence spectroscopy was used to examine the dynamics of propellant dissociation near the emitter tip of a single-emitter porous electrospray thruster loaded with the ionic liquid EMI-BF4. Luminescence spectra from CH, C2, CN, NH, BH, Hα, and Hβ were observed and confirmed by comparison with simulated spectra. Analysis of the CH (A 2Δ, v′ = 0) spectra yielded a rotational temperature 3082 ± 30 K while the C2 (d 3Πg− a 3Πu) Swan system yielded rotational temperatures 6252 ± 92 K and 5914 ± 75 K for Δv = 0 and Δv = +1, respectively. Examination of the integrated spectral signals from acquired CH (A 2Δ), BH (A 1Π), and Hα spectra showed a strong correlation with measured extractor current in both positive and negative polarity mode. The evidence suggests the formation of these electronically excited species is due to dissociative excitation induced by high-energy collisions between emitted ions and propellant accumulated on the extractor orifice. A weak broadband signal was also observed and is likely due to dissociative excitation of the anion, BF4−, leading to the formation of electronically excited BF2. Analysis of the neutral gas within the test chamber with a mass spectrometer confirmed the presence of BF2, providing strong evidence the observed broadband signal is the result of BF2.}
