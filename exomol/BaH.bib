Abstract = {{Vibrational branching ratios in the B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+) and
   A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) optical-cycling transitions of BaH molecules are
   investigated using measurements and ab initio calculations. The
   experimental values are determined using fluorescence and absorption
   detection. The observed branching ratios have a very sensitive
   dependence on the difference in the equilibrium bond length between the
   excited and ground state, Delta r(e):a 1-pm (0.5\%) displacement can
   have a 25\% effect on the branching ratios but only a 1\% effect on the
   lifetime. The measurements are combined with theoretical calculations to
   reveal a preference for a particular set of published spectroscopic
   values for the B-2 Sigma(+) state (Delta r(e)(B-X)= +5.733 pm), while a
   larger bond-length difference (Delta r(e)(B-X) = 6.3-6.7 pm) would match
   the branching-ratio data even better. By contrast, the observed
   branching ratio for the A(2)Pi(3/2)-X-2 Sigma(+) transition is in
   excellent agreement with both the ab initio result and the
   spectroscopically measured bond lengths. This shows that care must be
   taken when estimating branching ratios for molecular laser cooling
   candidates, as small errors in bond-length measurements can have outsize
   effects on the suitability for laser cooling. Additionally, our
   calculations agree more closely with experimental values of the B-2
   Sigma(+) state lifetime and spin-rotation constant, and revise the
   predicted lifetime of the H-2 Delta state to 9.5 mu s.}},
