Title = {{Beryllium monohydride (BeH): Where we are now, after 86 years of
   spectroscopy}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {311},
Pages = {76-83},
Abstract = {BeH is one of the most important benchmark systems for ab initio methods
   and for studying Born-Oppenheimer breakdown. However the best empirical
   potential and best ab initio potential for the ground electronic state
   to date give drastically different predictions in the long-range region
   between where the highest measurements have been made, and the
   dissociation energy; a region which is about similar to 1000 cm(-1) for
   (BeH)-Be-9, similar to 3000 cm(-1) for (BeD)-Be-9, and similar to 13 000
   cm(-1) for (BeT)-Be-9. Improved empirical potentials and
   Born-Oppenheimer breakdown corrections have now been built in this work
   for the ground electronic states X(1(2)Sigma(+)) of all three
   isotopologues. The predicted dissociation energy for (BeH)-Be-9 from the
   new empirical potential is now in agreement with the current best ab
   initio prediction in all 5 digits of the former's precision, while the
   previous best empirical potential was in disagreement by 74 cm(-1). The
   previous best empirical potential predicted the existence of unobserved
   vibrational levels for all three isotopologues, and the current best ab
   initio study also predicted the existence of all of these levels, and 7
   more in total. With the exception of two, the present empirical
   potential agrees with the existence of all of the ab initio potentials'
   extra levels not predicted by the earlier empirical potential. With one
   exception, all energy spacings between vibrational energy levels for
   which measurements have been made, are predicted with an agreement of
   better than 1 cm(-1) between the new empirical potential and the current
   best ab initio potential, but some predictions for unobserved levels are
   still in great disagreement, and the equilibrium bond lengths are
   different by orders of magnitude.},

pages = {103001},
abstract = {The effective sputtering yield of Be $(Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm tot})$ was
determined in situ by emission spectroscopy of low ionizing Be as function of
the deuteron impact energy (Ein = 25–175 eV) and Be surface temperature
(Tsurf = 200 °C–520 °C) in limiter discharges carried out in the JET tokamak.
Be self sputtering dominates the erosion at high impact energies (Ein > 150 eV)
and causes $Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm tot}$ far beyond 1. $Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm tot}$ drops to
low values, below 4.5%, at the accessible lowest impact energy (Ein sime 25 eV)
achievable in limiter configuration. At medium impact energies, Ein = 75 eV, two
contributors to the measured $Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm tot}$ of 9% were identified: two
third of the eroded Be originates from bare physical sputtering $(Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm phys})$
and one third from chemical assisted physical sputtering $(Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm chem})$.
The later mechanism has been clearly identified by the appearance of BeD A–X emission
and quantified in cause of a temperature dependence at which the BeD practically
vanishes at highest observed Be limiter temperatures. The recorded Tsurf dependence,
obtained in a series of 34 identical discharges with ratch-up of Tsurf by plasma
impact and inertial cooling after the discharge, revealed that the reduction of
BeD is correlated with an increase of D2 emission. The release mechanism of deuterium
in the Be interaction layer is exchanged under otherwise constant recycling flux
conditions at the limiter. The reduction of $Y_{\rm Be}^{\rm chem}$ with Tsurf
is also correlated to the reduction of the Be content in the core plasma providing
information on the total source strength and Be screening. The chemical assisted
physical sputtering, always present at the nominal limiter pre-heating temperature
of Tsurf = 200 °C, is associated with an additional sputtering channel with respect
to ordinary physical sputtering which is surface temperature independent. These
JET experiments in limiter configuration are used to benchmark the ERO code and
verify ITER first wall erosion prediction. The ERO code overestimates the observed
Be sputtering in JET by a factor of about 2.5 which can be transferred to ITER
predictions and prolong the expected lifetime of first wall elements.},

Title = {{Full configuration interaction calculation of BeH adiabatic states}},

Volume = {129},
pages = {054310},
Abstract = {An all-electron full configuration interaction (FCI) calculation of the
   adiabatic potential energy curves of some of the lower states of BeH
   molecule is presented. A moderately large ANO basis set of atomic
   natural orbitals (ANO) augmented with Rydberg functions has been used
   in order to describe the valence and Rydberg states and their
   interactions. The Rydberg set of ANOs has been placed on the Be at all
   bond distances. So, the basis set can be described as
   4s3p2d1f/3s2p1d(Be/H)+4s4p2d(Be). The dipole moments of several states
   and transition dipole strengths from the ground state are also reported
   as a function of the RBe-H distance. The position and the number of
   states involved in several avoided crossings present in this system
   have been discussed. Spectroscopic parameters have been calculated from
   a number of the vibrational states that result from the adiabatic
   curves except for some states in which this would be completely
   nonsense, as it is the case for the very distorted curves of the 3s and
   3p (2)Sigma(+) states or the double-well potential of the 4p (2)Pi
   state. The so-called ``D complex{''} at 54 050 cm(-1) (185.0 nm) is
   resolved into the three 3d substates ((2)Sigma(+),(2)Pi,(2)Delta). A
   diexcited valence state is calculated as the lowest state of
   (2)Sigma(-) symmetry and its spectroscopic parameters are reported, as
   well as those of the 2 (2)Delta (4d) state The adiabatic curve of the 4
   (2)Sigma(+) state shows a swallow well at large distances (around 4.1
   angstrom) as a result of an avoided crossing with the 3 (2)Sigma(+)
   state. The probability that some vibrational levels of this well could
   be populated is discussed within an approached Landau-Zerner model and
   is found to be high. No evidence is found of the E(4s sigma)
   (2)Sigma(+) state in the region of the ``D complex{''}. Instead, the
   spectroscopic properties obtained from the (4s sigma) 6 (2)Sigma(+)
   adiabatic curve of the present work seem to agree with those of the
   experimental F(4p sigma) (2)Sigma(+) state. The FCI calculations
   provide benchmark results for other correlation models for the
   open-shell BeH system and evidence both the limitations and
   capabilities of the basis set.},

Title = {{Spin-restricted open-shell coupled-cluster theory for excited states}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2000},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {4027-4036},
Abstract = {Using a linear-response approach, the recently introduced
   spin-restricted coupled-cluster (SR-CC) theory is extended to the
   treatment of excited states of high-spin open-shell molecules. Explicit
   equations are given within the usual singles and doubles approximation
   and our implementation (within an existing spin-orbital code) is
   described. It is shown that in SR-CC theory, due to spin constraints,
   the spin-expectation value for the excited states calculated as
   corresponding energy derivatives always corresponds to the exact value.
   In addition, the SR-CC singles and doubles (SR-CCSD) approach is
   extended to include also the so-called pseudotriple excitations (best
   described as double excitations with an additional spin-flip in one
   open-shell orbital) which are important for the description of so-called
   low-spin excited states. Exploratory calculations for a few diatomic
   systems (BeH, OH, NO, CN, and CO(+)) show that problems due to spin
   contamination in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) CCSD treatment of
   excited states are rectified by using a restricted open-shell
   Hartree-Fock (ROHF) reference, as it is done in the SR-CC approach.
   While SR-CCSD performs well for high-spin excited states, the closely
   related partially spin-adapted (PSA) CC approach is shown to be inferior
   and errors in the computed excitation energies are generally larger than
   the typical accuracy of about 0.2 eV in CCSD excited state treatments.
   So-called low-spin states (e.g., the 2 (2)B(1) state of NH(2)) are shown
   to require inclusion of pseudotriple excitations for even a
   qualitatively correct description. If they are included, ROHF-CC, SR-CC,
   and PSA-CC give essentially identical results.},

   identification of the molecular features and separation of overlapping
   atomic lines, the comparison of simulations and observations allow quite
   sensitive determination of rotational and vibrational temperatures for
   the above diatomics in a divertor fusion plasma. Systematic studies show
   that T-r and T-v are comparable for BeD but T-v is significantly less
   than T-r for CD and C-2. The BeD spectrum time history during a pulse
   (modulated by sweeping) appears as localized emission from the strike
   points similar to that of the atomic Bet visible spectrum lines. On the
   other hand, the CD bands during a swept pulse: indicate a more
   distributed source. Thus both the BeD spectrum and time history suggest
   physical sputtering of BeD at the strike points. In contrast, the CD
   spectrum and time history indicate chemical release of higher deuterides
   followed by catabolism to CD. This work constitutes the first detailed

   An ab initio method of calculation of the vibrational transition

   and vibrational problems by analytical variational techniques and the
   representation of the potential energy and dipole moment hypersurfaces
   as Taylor's series expansions in normal coordinates up to the fourth
   order. The dipole moment matrix elements are then evaluated by simple
   analytical formulae. In this first paper, some of the approximations

   results obtained for diatomic molecules (BeH, HF, NH and NO) with a
   comparison to experimental and other theoretical results found in the
   literature. The dependence on the results of the effects of electrical
   and mechanical anharmonicities, electron correlation and basis set

the current formulation of SAIM. A new extension is developed here in which atomic
eigenfunctions are partitioned into inner‐shell and outer‐shell components. These
component functions are rigorously defined as solutions of two simultaneous eigenvalue
equations; the Hamiltonians in these equations add to yield the original total
atomic Hamiltonian. The component Hamiltonians so defined are shown to contain
potential energy functions which are approximately homogeneous functions of degree
minus one; hence, Coulomb‐like. Thus, the inner‐shell and outer‐shell eigenfunctions
may be scaled independently using methods generalized from standard scaled atoms‐in‐molecules

curve to be calculated. The limiting curve of the predissociation confirms the
previous value of the dissociation energy (D: = 17 426 r 100 cm-I) and indicates
that a small maximum, less than 200 ern-.', could exist at r = 3.3 A in the ground state

the excited spin-coupled orbitals is that, except those with the highest energy,
they retain the characteristic distorted atomic form of the ground state orbitals,
and correspondingly possess negative orbital energies. This leads to compact and
rapidly convergent wavefunctions for the ground and lower-lying excited states,
thus overcoming one of the basic drawbacks of the original v.b. theory. The theory
is applied to the 2∑ + states of BeH by using 53, 71 and 80 structures of this kind.
Very good convergence is found for the lowest six states, and the total energy of
the ground state is below that given by a very large m.o.c.i. calculation. The
present theory is thus a powerful and flexible alternative to m.o.c.i. calculations
