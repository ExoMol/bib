  abstract = {Accurate line lists for three molecules, BeH, MgH and CaH, in their
	ground electronic states are presented. These line lists are suitable
	for temperatures relevant to exoplanetary atmospheres and cool stars
	(up to 2000 K). A combination of empirical and ab initio methods
	is used. The rovibrational energy levels of BeH, MgH and CaH are
	computed using the programs level and dpotfit in conjunction with
	spectroscopic potential energy curves (PECs). The PEC of BeH is taken
	from the literature, while the PECs of CaH and MgH are generated
	by fitting to the experimental transition energy levels. Both spin-rotation
	interactions (except for BeH, for which it is negligible) and non-adiabatic
	corrections are explicitly taken into account. Accurate line intensities
	are generated using newly computed ab initio dipole moment curves
	for each molecule using high levels of theory. Full line lists of
	rotationvibration transitions for 9BeH, 24MgH, 25MgH, 26MgH and 40CaH
	are made available in an electronic form as supporting information
	to this paper and at www.exomol.com.},
