Abstract = {{The hydroxides of Ca, Sr, and Ba are known to be linear molecules, while
   MgOH is quasilinear. High-level ab initio calculations for BeOH predict
   a bent equilibrium structure with a bond angle of 140.9 degrees,
   indicating a significant contribution of covalency to the bonding.
   However, experimental confirmation of the bent structure is lacking. In
   the present study, we have used laser excitation techniques to observe
   the 2(2)A `-1(2)A ` transition of BeOH/D in the energy range of
   30300-32800 cm(-1). Rotationally resolved spectra were obtained, with
   sufficient resolution to reveal spin splittings for the electronically
   excited state. Two-color photoionization was used to determine an
   ionization energy of 66425(10) cm(-1). Ab initio calculations were used
   to guide the analysis of the spectroscopic data. Multireference
   configuration interaction calculations were used to construct potential
   energy surfaces for the 1(2)A `, 2(2)A `, and 1(2)A `' states. The
   rovibronic eigenstates supported by these surfaces, were determined
   using the Morse oscillator rigid bender internal dynamics Hamiltonian.
   The theoretical results were in sufficiently good agreement with the
   experimental data to permit unambiguous assignment. It was confirmed
   that the equilibrium geometry of the ground state is bent and that the
   barrier to linearity lies below the zero-point energies for both BeOH
   and BeOD.}},
