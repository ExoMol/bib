   set of conventions and symbols which are in common use in the
   spectroscopic literature. This document, which is Part 3 in a series,
   deals with symmetry notation referring to groups that involve nuclear
   permutations and the inversion operation. Further parts will follow,
   dealing inter alia with vibration-rotation spectroscopy and electronic
