   II. Formation-excitation at work?}},
Journal = AA,

Volume = {699},
Abstract = {Context. Recent spectroscopic measurements have revealed absorption from
   higher rotational levels in C-2 than previous observations. These
   improvements are accompanied by the availability of updated radiative
   and collisional data. Aims. We revisit the density and radiation field
   intensity diagnostics provided by the observations of many rotational
   levels of interstellar C-2 and extensive molecular information. Methods.
   We built an excitation model of C-2 without spatial structure, including
   levels up to J = 34 where updated radiative and collisional excitation
   data are introduced as well as excitation by chemical formation.
   Results. We confirm the importance of the recent collisional excitation
   rate coefficients of C-2 by molecular H-2. We show that the new higher
   level observations cannot be explained by the standard balance between
   collisional excitation and radiative transitions. We propose that
   chemical excitation at formation provides a plausible mechanism to
   explain the observed high excitation ofC(2). In addition, it allows us
   to lift the degeneracy of the density over radiation field strength
   parameter in the excitation model. Conclusions. A 0D model remains
   limited and it is highly desirable to use a full Photon Dominated Region
   (PDR) model, which includes all excitation processes introduced here and
   full chemical and thermal balance.},

Abstract = {Combustion temperatures were measured for hydroxyl-terminated
   polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel strands using three-color pyrometry.
   Cylindrical strands were burned in an opposed oxidizer flow.
   Two-dimensional temperature maps from pyrometry indicated that flame
   temperature increased with radial distance from the center of the
   strand. Pyrometry results were generally in agreement with
   previously-reported broadband emission spectroscopy and with a
   one-dimensional computational model of HTPB combustion.
   High-resolution emission spectra were also collected for HTPB flames in
   a band around 480 nm that provides access to the C-2 Swan bands. The
   ExoMol spectral database was used to produce a library of calculated
   spectra. Comparison between each experimental spectrum and the library
   provided a best-fit temperature for the spectrum. Experimental and
   calculated spectra agree very well but indicate a much higher
   temperature than expected from other methods, suggesting that the C-2
   radical is not in thermal equilibrium with the flow. Further
   investigation of the validity of this technique and the significance of
   its results is warranted.},

   Predissociation in the Vacuum Ultraviolet Region},
Journal = JPCL,
Year = {2024},
Abstract = {The radiative and photodissociative properties of the dicarbon molecule,
   C-2, in high-lying electronic states are of utmost importance for
   modeling the photochemical processes that occur in various astronomical
   environments. Despite extensive spectroscopic studies in the last two
   centuries, the photodissociation properties of C-2 are still largely
   unknown, particularly for quantum states in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   region. Here, the lifetimes of C-2 for each individual rovibrational
   level in the recently identified 2(3)Sigma(-)(g) state are measured for
   the first time using a VUV-pump-UV-probe photoionization scheme. The
   lifetimes are found to be strongly dependent on the rotational and
   vibrational quantum levels in the 2(3)Sigma(-)(g) state. The strongly
   rotationally dependent lifetimes observed here indicate that the
   2(3)Sigma(-)(g) state may mainly undergo a predissociation process
   through couplings with nearby repulsive electronic states. The current
   observation could have important applications in modeling the
   interstellar medium and cometary comae.},

We have observed the bright metal-poor benchmark star HD 122563, along with two stars in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II (Ret ii), one of which was previously identified as a candidate member, but did not have a previous detailed chemical abundance analysis. We find that this candidate (GDR3 0928) to be a bona fide member of Ret ii, and from a spectral synthesis analysis it is also revealed to be a CEMP-r star, with significant enhancements in several light elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Si), in addition to featuring an r-process enhancement like many other Ret ii stars. The light-element enhancements in this star resemble the abundance patterns seen in the CEMP-no stars of other ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, and are thought to have been produced by an independent source from the r-process. These unusual abundance patterns are thought to be produced by faint supernovae, which may be produced by some of the earliest generations of stars.}

   C-2 via its F-1?(u) state}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {157},
Abstract = {Photodissociation is one of the main destruction pathways for dicarbon
   (C-2) in astronomical environments, such as diffuse interstellar clouds,
   yet the accuracy of modern astrochemical models is limited by a lack of
   accurate photodissociation cross sections in the vacuum ultraviolet
   range. C-2 features a strong predissociative F-1 Pi(u )- X-1 sigma(+)(g)
   electronic transition near 130 nm originally measured in 1969; however,
   no experimental studies of this transition have been carried out since,
   and theoretical studies of the F-1 Pi(u ) state are limited. In this
   work, potential energy curves of excited electronic states of C-2 are
   calculated with the aim of describing the predissociative nature of the
   F-1 Pi(u ) state and providing new ab initio photodissociation cross
   sections for astrochemical applications. Accurate electronic
   calculations of 56 singlet, triplet, and quintet states are carried out
   at the DW-SA-CASSCF/MRCI+Q level of theory with a CAS(8,12) active space
   and the aug-cc-pV5Z basis set augmented with additional diffuse
   functions. Photodissociation cross sections arising from the vibronic
   ground state to the F-1 Pi(u ) state are calculated by a coupled-channel
   model. The total integrated cross section through the F-1 Pi(u ) v = 0
   and v = 1 bands is 1.198 x 10(-13) cm(2) cm(-1), giving rise to a
   photodissociation rate of 5.02 x 10(-10) s(-1) under the standard
   interstellar radiation field, much larger than the rate in the Leiden
   photodissociation database. In addition, we report a new 2(1)sigma(+)(u)
   state that should be detectable via a strong 2(1)sigma(+)(u)-X-1
   sigma(+)(g) band around 116 nm.},

Abstract = {We report on a scheme for laser cooling of C-12(2). We have calculated

	abstract = {It has long been observed that the coma of a comet is often green while its tail is not. While the explanation for this must be that the molecules responsible for the green emission, C2, are photodissociated, the mechanism was, until now, unknown. We have observed the photodissociation of C2 in the laboratory for the first time and, in doing so, have determined its bond dissociation energy with unprecedented precision. Invoking the observed mechanism, the calculated lifetime of cometary C2 is found to be consistent with astronomical observations.The dicarbon molecule (C2) is found in flames, comets, stars, and the diffuse interstellar medium. In comets, it is responsible for the green color of the coma, but it is not found in the tail. It has long been held to photodissociate in sunlight with a lifetime precluding observation in the tail, but the mechanism was not known. Here we directly observe photodissociation of C2. From the speed of the recoiling carbon atoms, a bond dissociation energy of 602.804(29) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1 is determined, with an uncertainty comparable to its more experimentally accessible N2 and O2 counterparts. The value is within 0.03 kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1 of high-level quantum theory. This work shows that, to break the quadruple bond of C2 using sunlight, the molecule must absorb two photons and undergo two {\textquotedblleft}forbidden{\textquotedblright} transitions.All study data are included in the article and/or SI Appendix.},

pages = {481–489},
abstract = {Dicarbon, the molecule formed from two carbon atoms, is among the most
abundant molecules in the universe. Said by some to exhibit a quadruple bond, it
is bound by more than 6 eV and supports a large number of valence electronic states.
It thus has a rich spectroscopy, with 19 one-photon band systems, four of which were
discovered by the author and co-workers. Its spectrum was among the first to be
described: Wollaston reported the emission spectra from blue flames in 1802.
C2 is observed in a variety of astronomical objects, including stars, circumstellar
shells, nebulae, comets and the interstellar medium. It is responsible for the green
color of cometary comae but is not observed in the comet tail. It can be observed
in absorption and emission by optical spectroscopy in the infrared, visible, and
ultraviolet regions of the spectrum, and because it has no electric-dipole-allowed
vibrational or rotational transitions, its spectral signature is a sensitive probe
of the local environment. Before the work described in this Account, models of C2
photophysics included the thitherto-unobserved c3Σu+ state and parametrized the
strength of spin-forbidden intercombination transitions. Furthermore, they did not
account for photodissociation of C2, even though it was identified in the 1930s
as a key process. Inspired by the observation of C2 in the Red Rectangle nebula,
the author was motivated to instill rigor into C2 models and embarked on a spectroscopic
and computational journey that has lasted 15 years. We were the first to identify
the c3Σu+ state through the d3Πg–c3Σu+ transitions, which were to become known as
the “Duck” system. This minor partner to the well-known Swan bands is a key part
of astrophysical C2 models and can now be included with rigor. We identified the
e3Πg–c3Σu+ system, and the c3Σu+ state is now well-studied. Meanwhile others described
the singlet–triplet and triplet–quintet interactions in exquisite detail, allowing
rigorous modeling of the a–X and c–X intercombination transitions.
The final piece of the C2 puzzle would be understanding how long it survives before
being broken into carbon atom fragments. Though predicted by Herzberg, predissociation
in the e3Πg state had never been observed. To find it would require the complicated
ultraviolet spectroscopy of C2 to be disentangled. In so doing, we identified
the 43Πg and 33Πg states of C2, thus uncovering two new band systems. The 43Πg
state allowed the first accurate determination of the ionization energy of C2.
With these new band systems secure, we extracted new levels of the D1Σu+ state
(Mulliken bands) and the e3Πg state (Fox–Herzberg bands) from our spectra. Upon
climbing the energy ladder in the e3Πg state to v = 12, we finally identified the
route to predissociation of C2 via non-adiabatic coupling to the d3Πg state. This
observation provided the first laboratory evidence for why C2 is observed in the
coma of a comet but not the tail.},

abstract = {6229 lines of the Ballik-Ramsay system (b3Σg−–a3Πu) and the Phillips
system (A1Πu–X1Σg+) of C2 up to v = 8 and J = 76, which were taken from the literature
or assigned in the present work, were analyzed simultaneously by least-squares
fitting with 82 Dunham-like molecular parameters and spin-orbit interaction constants
between the b3Σg− and X1Σg+ states with a standard deviation of 0.0037 cm−1 for
the whole data set. As a result of the deperturbation analysis, the spin-orbit
interaction constant AbX was determined as 6.333(7) cm−1 and the energy difference
between the X1Σg+ and a3Πu states was determined as 720.008(2) cm−1 for the potential
minima or 613.650(3) cm−1 for the v = 0 levels with Merer and Brown’s N2 Hamiltonian
for 3Π states, which is about 3.3 cm−1 larger than the previously determined value.
Due to this sizable change, a new energy-level crossing was found at J = 2 for v = 3 (F1)
of b3Σg− state and v = 6 of X1Σg+ state, where the strong interaction causes a nearly
complete mixing of the wave functions of the b3Σg− and X1Σg+ states and the forbidden
transitions become observable. Using the predictions of our deperturbation analysis,
we were able to identify 16 forbidden transitions between the singlet and triplet
states at the predicted frequencies with the expected intensities, which verifies
our value for the energy difference between the X1Σg+ and a3Πu states.},

a single bond, with a vibrational frequency of about 1268 cm-1, and an equilibrium bond
length of 1.57 Å. The state is predicted to exhibit a barrier to dissociation, with a
rotational constant that unusually increases with vibrational excitation up to a
maximum before decreasing at higher vibrational excitation. The new band system allows
us to probe the a3Πu state of C2 through a straightforward 1 + 1 REMPI scheme.},

Abstract = {Diatomic carbon, C$_2$, has been variously described as having a double,

   valence bond (GVB) calculations on C$_2$. The GVB wave function-more
   accurate than the Hartree-Fock wave function and easier to interpret
   than traditional multiconfiguration wave functions is well-suited for
   characterizing the bonding in C$_2$. The GVB calculations show that the
   electronic wave function of C2 is not well described by a product of
   singlet-coupled, shared electron pairs (perfect pairing), which is the
   theoretical basis for covalent chemical bonds. Rather, C$_2$ is best
   described as having a traditional covalent a bond with the electrons in
   the remaining orbitals of the two carbon atoms antiferromagnetically
   coupled. However, even this description is incomplete as the perfect
   pairing spin function also makes a significant contribution to the full
   GVB wave function. The complicated structure of the wave function of C$_2$
   is the source of the uncertainty about the nature of the bonding in this

energy curves (PECs) of the four lowest lying singlet states (X1Σ+g,A1Πu,B1Δg,andB′1Σ+g)
were obtained by high-level ab initio calculations. Valence electron correlation
was accounted for by the correlation energy extrapolation by intrinsic scaling (CEEIS)
method. Additional corrections to the PECs included core–valence correlation and
relativistic effects. Spin–orbit corrections were found to be insignificant. The
impact of using dynamically weighted reference wave functions in conjunction with
CEEIS was examined and found to give indistinguishable results from the even weighted
method. The PECs showed multiple curve crossings due to the B1Δg state as well as an
avoided crossing between the two 1Σ+g states. Vibrational energy levels were computed
for each of the four electronic states, as well as rotational constants and spectroscopic
parameters. Comparison between the theoretical and experimental results showed excellent
agreement overall. Equilibrium bond distances are reproduced to within 0.05 %.
The dissociation energies of the states agree with experiment to within ~0.5 kcal/mol,
achieving “chemical accuracy.” Vibrational energy levels show average deviations of ~20 cm-1 or less.
The B1Δg state shows the best agreement with a mean absolute deviation of 2.41 cm-1.
Calculated rotational constants exhibit very good agreement with experiment, as

Title = {{The origin of peculiar molecular bands in cool {DQ} white dwarfs}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {519},
pages = {L8},
Abstract = {The DQ white dwarfs are stars whose atmosphere is enriched
with carbon, which for cool stars (T(eff) < 8000 K) is indicated by the Swan bands
of C(2) in the optical part of their spectra. With decreasing effective temperature
these molecular bands undergo a significant blueshift (similar to 100-300 angstrom).
The origin of this phenomenon has been disputed over the last two decades and has
remained unknown. We attempt to address this problem by investigating the impact of
dense helium on the spectroscopic properties of molecular carbon, the electronic
Swan band transition energy T(e) and the vibrational frequency omega(e), under the
physical conditions encountered inside helium-rich, fluid-like atmospheres of cool
DQ white dwarfs. Methods. In our investigation we use a density functional theory
based quantum mechanical approach.  Results. The electronic transition energy T(e)
increases monotonically with the helium density (Delta T(e) (eV) similar to 1.6 rho
(g/cm(3))). This causes the Swan absorption to occur at shorter wavelengths compared
with unperturbed C(2). On the other hand the pressure-induced increase in the
vibrational frequency is insufficient to account for the observed Swan bands shifts.
Our findings are in line with the shape of the distorted molecular bands observed
in DQp stars, but the predicted photospheric density required to reproduce these
spectral features is one order of magnitude lower than the one predicted by the
current models. This indicates pollution by hydrogen or reflects incomplete knowledge
of the properties of fluid-like atmospheres of these stars. Conclusions. Our work
shows that at the physical conditions encountered in the fluid-like atmospheres of
cool DQ white dwarfs the strong interactions between C(2) and helium atoms cause
an increase in T(e), which should produce a blueward shift of the Swan bands.
This is consistent with the observations and indicates that the observed Swan-like
molecular bands are most likely the pressure-shifted bands of C(2).},

abstract = {The Red Rectangle proto-planetary nebula (HD 44179) is known for a number
of rather narrow emission features superimposed on a broad extended red emission (ERE)
covering the 5000-7500 angstrom regime. The origin of these emission features is unknown.
Aims. The aim of the present work is to search for potential carriers by combining
new observational and laboratory data. This also allows to interpret spectral
emission features in terms of actual physical conditions like temperature and
density constraints and to trace chemical processes in the outflows of the Red
Rectangle. Methods. Observational spectra have been obtained with the EMMI-NTT
at offsets of 3 '', 6 '', 7 '', 11 '', 16 '' and 20 '' distance to the central
star HD 44179. The spectra are compared to the outcome of a time-gated laser
induced fluorescence laboratory study of an expanding acetylene plasma using a
special supersonic pin-hole discharge source. With this set-up the hydrocarbon
chemistry in the Red Rectangle nebula is simulated under laboratory controlled
conditions. The plasma source has the unique feature to generate electronically
and vibrationally excited species at low rotational temperatures. The comparison
is facilitated by a simple model for fluorescent emission in the nebula.
Results. Two of the astronomically observed narrow emission bands can be assigned
as originating from unresolved rovibronic progressions within the d(3)Pi(g) ->
a(3)Pi(u) Swan system of the C$_2$ radical. The band appearance corresponds to
a rotational temperature between 200 and 1000 K. The emission is driven by absorption
in the C$_2$ Phillips bands followed by intersystem crossing from the singlet to the
triplet state and pumping in the Swan bands. Conclusions. These observations imply
an active (photo) chemistry in the ejecta of the Red Rectangle.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {508},
Pages = {909-922},
Abstract = {The aim of this work is to shed some light on the problem of the
   formation of carbon stars of R-type from a detailed study of their
   chemical composition.
   Methods. We use high-resolution and high signal-to-noise optical spectra
   of 23 R-type stars (both early-and late-types) selected from the
   Hipparcos catalogue. The chemical analysis is made using spectral
   synthesis in LTE and state-of-the-art carbon-rich spherical model
   atmospheres. We derive their CNO content (including the C-12/C-13
   ratio), average metallicity, lithium, and light (Sr, Y, Zr) and heavy
   (Ba, La, Nd, Sm) s-element abundances. The observed properties of the
   stars (galactic distribution, kinematics, binarity, photometry and
   luminosity) are also discussed.
   Results. Our analysis shows that late-R stars are carbon stars with
   identical chemical and observational characteristics as the normal
   (N-type) AGB carbon stars. The s-element abundance pattern derived can
   be reproduced by low-mass AGB nucleosynthesis models where the
   C-13(alpha, n)O-16 reaction is the main neutron donor. We confirm the
   results of the sole previous abundance analysis of early-R stars, namely
   that they are carbon stars with near solar metallicity showing enhanced
   nitrogen, low C-12/C-13 ratios and no s-element enhancements. In
   addition, we have found that early-R stars have Li abundances larger
   than expected for post RGB tip giants. We also find that a significant
   number (similar to 40\%) of the early-R stars in our sample are wrongly
   classified, probably being classical CH stars and normal K giants.
   Conclusions. On the basis of the chemical analysis, we confirm the
   previous suggestion that late-R stars are just misclassified N-type
   carbon stars in the AGB phase of evolution. Their photometric,
   kinematic, variability and luminosity properties are also compatible
   with this. In consequence, we suggest that the number of true R stars is
   considerably lower than previously believed. This alleviates the problem
   of considering R stars as a frequent stage in the evolution of low-mass
   stars. We briefly discuss the different scenarios proposed for the
   formation of early-R stars. The mixing of carbon during an anomalous
   He-flash is favoured, although no physical mechanism able to trigger
   that mixing has been found yet. The origin of these stars still remains
   a mystery.},

were carried out through a Monte Carlo simulation of the radiative transfer in the
circumstellar envelopes of the stars. The full set of indices, when applied to our

Pages = {1292-1297},
Abstract = {White dwarfs (WDs) with carbon absorption features in their optical
   spectra are known as DQ WDs. The subclass of peculiar DQ WDs are cool
   objects (T-eff less than or similar to 6000 K) that show molecular
   absorption bands that have centroid wavelengths similar to 100-300
   angstrom shortward of the bandheads of the C$_2$ Swan bands. These
   ``peculiar DQ bands'' have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such as C2H.
   We point out that C2H does not show strong absorption bands with
   wavelengths matching those of the peculiar DQ bands, and neither does
   any other simple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool WD
   atmosphere. C$_2$ seems to be the only reasonable candidate for producing
   the peculiar DQ bands. Many characteristics of those bands can be
   understood if they are pressure-shifted Swan bands. While current models
   of WD atmospheres suggest that, in general, peculiar DQ WDs do not have
   higher photospheric pressures than normal DQ WDs do, that finding
   requires confirmation by improved models of WD atmospheres and of the
   behavior of C$_2$ at high pressures and temperatures. If it is eventually
   shown that the peculiar DQ bands cannot be explained as pressure shifted
   Swan bands, the only explanation remaining would seem to be that they
   arise from highly rotationally excited C$_2$ (J(peak) greater than or
   similar to 45). In either case, the absorption band profiles can in
   principle be used to constrain the pressure and the rotational
   temperature of C$_2$ in the line-forming regions of normal and peculiar DQ
   WD atmospheres, which will be useful for comparison with models.
   Finally, we note that progress in understanding magnetic DQ WDs may
   require models that simultaneously consider magnetic fields, high
   pressures, and rotational excitation of C$_2$.},

Abstract = {Intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS) is used to measure the
   absolute concentration profiles of HCO and C$_2$ in low-pressure
   acetylene/oxygen/nitrogen flames with equivalence ratios phi = 0.8, 1.0,
   1.5, 2.0 and 2.5. The flames with phi = 2.0 and 2.5 are soot-producing,
   with light extinction reaching 0.1\% per pass in the flame with. = 2.5.
   This strong broadband extinction does not affect the sensitivity of
   ICLAS, however. The temperature profiles of the flames were measured
   using laser-induced fluorescence of the OH radicals. For C$_2$
   concentration measurements, the (0-2) vibronic transition of the
   d(3)Pi(g)<- a(3)Pi(u) Swan band is used. The lines of this transition
   are located close to the HCO lines, making it possible to measure the
   two radical concentrations simultaneously. The C$_2$ concentration is
   highest in the phi = 1.5 flame, and lower in the lean and heavily sooted
   phi=2.5 flames.},

Abstract = {The C$_2$ Swan system (d(3)Pi(g)-a(3)Pi(u)) was observed in emission for
   the Delta v = -3 to Delta v = +2 sequences in the 14,000-24,000 cm(-1)

   global simultaneous fit by including a wide range of vibrational states.
   A total of 34 bands with v' = 0-10 and v `' = 0-9 were rotationally
   assigned. Numerous discrepancies were found in the assignments and in
   the measured transition wavenumbers between the new measurements and
   previous results. Most of the measured transition wavenumbers and their
   assignments for relatively low-v bands agreed with published data. On
   the contrary, for high-v bands our line positions and assignments
   disagreed with the tabulated literature values. In particular, the lines
   of six bands involving the levels with v' = 4, 5, and 6 are almost
   completely different from the previous work. Major sources of the
   disagreement are thought to be line congestion and perturbations found
   in these bands. From the analysis, perturbations for v' = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,
   8, 9, and 10 in the d(3)Pi(g) state were identified. A study of these
   rotational perturbations suggest that some of them are likely caused by
   interactions with high-v levels of the b (3)Sigma(-)(g) state.},

Title = {{Carbon stars in the Hamburg/ESO survey: Abundances}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {137-160},
Abstract = {We have carried out a detailed abundance analysis using high-dispersion
   spectra from HIRES at Keck for a sample of 16 carbon stars found among
   candidate extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars from the Hamburg/ESO Survey
   (HES). We find that the Fe metallicities for the cooler C stars (T-eff
   similar to 5100 K) have been underestimated by a factor of similar to 10
   by the standard HES tools. The results presented here provided crucial
   supporting data used recently by Cohen et al. to derive the frequency of
   C stars among EMP stars. C enhancement in these EMP C stars appears to
   be independent of Fe metallicity and approximately constant at similar
   to 1/5 the solar epsilon(C). The C enhancement shows some evidence of
   decreasing with decreasing T-eff (increasing luminosity), presumably due
   to mixing and dredge-up of C-depleted material. The mostly low C-12/C-13
   ratios (similar to 4) and the high N abundances in many of these stars
   suggest that material that has been through proton burning via the CN
   cycle comprises most of the stellar envelope. C enhancement in this
   sample is associated with strong enrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the
   Fe peak for 12 of the 16 stars. The remaining C stars from the HES,
   which tend to be the most Fe-poor, show no evidence for enhancement of
   the heavy elements. Very high enhancements of lead are detected in some
   of the C stars with highly enhanced Ba. The strong lead lines, the high
   Ba/Eu ratios, and the high ratios of abundances of the diagnostic
   elements in the first and second s-process peaks demonstrate that the
   s-process is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy elements for
   the majority of the C stars in our sample. The low C-12/C-13 ratios and
   large C and N enhancements of the EMP C stars are more extreme than
   those of intrinsic asymptotic giant branch C stars of near-solar Fe
   metallicity, but closer to the composition of CH stars. Our subsample of
   EMP C stars without s-process enhancement is reminiscent of the R-type C
   stars in the solar neighborhood; thus, we expect that they are formed by
   similar mechanisms. We suggest that both the s-process-enhanced and
   Ba-normal C stars result from phenomena associated with mass transfer in
   binary systems. This leads directly to the progression from C stars to
   CH stars and then to Ba stars as the Fe metallicity increases.},

Abstract = {Contemporaneous near-infrared (0.8-2.5 mum) and infrared (3-14 mum)
   spectroscopy is presented of the previously uncharacterized IRAS source
   07077+1536. The data show it to be a carbon star embedded in a
   circumstellar dust envelope. The near-infrared spectrum displays
   molecular absorption features of C-2, CN, and CO, while the 11 mum
   emission feature from SiC is present in the thermal infrared. The
   spectral energy distribution of IRAS 07077+ 1536 is similar to the
   so-called extreme carbon stars in that it consists primarily of a
   reddened stellar photosphere and thermal dust emission. However, the
   extinction is much less and the dust significantly warmer (similar to900
   K vs. similar to300 K) than in extreme carbon stars such as AFGL 3068.
   IRAS 07077+ 1536 is also unusually bright shortward of 0.5 mum, an
   aspect that could be due to variability but may indicate the presence of
   a binary companion or a foreground star.},

   number of rotational lines accurately constrains the gas-kinetic
   temperature T and the density n to T = 35 K and n = (600 +/- 100)
   cm(-3). The inferred C$_2$ column density is N(C$_2$) = (20(-2)(+4)) 10(13)
   cm(-2). The detection of various lines in the (1,0) and (2,0) band of
   the CN A(2)II(u) -X(2)Sigma (+) red system suggest a column density of
   N(CN) = (8-13) x 10(13) cm(-2). C$_2$ absorption lines are also detected
   towards Cyg OB2 No. 5 and No. 9. Inferred parameters are T = 50K, n =

   towards Cyg OB2 No. 8A indicate N(C$_2$) approximate to 3.3 x 10(13)
   cm(-2) and T approximate to 100 K. Upper limits are N(C$_2$) less than or
   equal to 3.3 x 10(13) cm(-2) toward Cyg OB2 No. 7 and No. 11. The C$_2$
   observations eliminate the possibility that the molecular material along
   the line of sight towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 is spread over a pathlength of
   several hundred parsecs of very low density n approximate to 10 cm(-3).
   The observations provide some support to a recent chemical model which
   assumes a nested structure of the molecular gas. Alternatively, the C2
   and CN abundances obtained towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 are in agreement with
   the predictions of an X-ray induced chemistry driven by an ionisation
   rate of zeta = (0.6-3) x 10(-15) s(-1). Calculated equilibrium
   temperatures of T = 25-50 K agree with temperatures inferred from C$_2$.
   The model also reproduces the observed column densities of CO and CH,
   and that of H-3(+) to within a factor of two. We predict a H2O+ column
   denity of 2 x 10(12) cm(-2) towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 and H2O+ absorption
   lines which are detectable by optical absorption line techniques. We
   report the detection of interstellar Rubidium towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 and
   No. 5. Inferred column densities are N(Rb) = (13 +/-2) x 10(9) cm(-2)
   towards No. 12 and N(Rb) = (13 +/-2) x 10(9) cm(-2) towards No. 5.},

Abstract = {We report on observations and analysis of the C$_2$ Swan band Delta nu = 0
   sequence in the optical spectrum of Comet Hale-Bopp, One set of
   observational data was obtained when this comet was at a large
   heliocentric distance (3.03 AU), This unusual distance provided the
   opportunity to enhance our knowledge of the intercombination transitions
   in C$_2$.
   These transitions are forbidden for electric dipole radiation, but they
   exist due to higher order multipole radiation. Although the transition
   probabilities are several orders of magnitude smaller than allowed
   electronic transitions, the intercombination bands play a key role in
   the fluorescence process of the C$_2$ radical. This role is to provide a
   cooling path for rotational and vibrational populations seen in the
   visible spectrum, Because their exact transition probability is not yet
   completely clear better quantitative knowledge of these transitions can
   help constrain C$_2$ quantities in comets.
   To analyze the data, an equilibrium fluorescence model with 5652
   different vibrational levels was created. This model included the
   triplet and singlet systems of C$_2$ involved in the fluorescence process.
   Theoretical spectra corresponding to different values of the electronic
   transition moments for the a(3)Pi(u)-X(1)Sigma(g)(+) and
   c(3)Sigma(u)(+)- X-1 Sigma(g)(+) transitions were computed. These
   spectra were then compared to the observational data. A good fit is

Abstract = {We have observed laser-induced fluorescence of two different band

   The first comprises several P and R lines of the (1,0) band of the e

   extending past 350 nm. The second is the band head region of the (7,1)
   band of the D (1)Sigma(u)(+) <-- B' (1)Sigma(g)(+) system, with
   fluorescence at 232 nm from D to the X (1)Sigma(g)(+) ground state.
   Neither band has been previously observed in any environment. The flame
   in these experiments is highly sooting, and the C$_2$ seen here is likely
   produced by laser vaporization of the soot with subsequent laser
   photolysis of a C$_2$ precursor. In a rich flame, this fluorescence could
   cause interferences in other studies such as KrF laser Raman scattering.
   Moreover, signal level calculations suggest native C$_2$ near 10 ppm could
   be readily observed using the Fox-Herzberg excitation. Raman
   measurements of major species (X greater than or equal to 0.01)in the
   same flame, using the KrF laser, are in good agreement with a model

Abstract = {We analysed CN red system (similar to 8000 Angstrom) and C-2 Swan system
   (similar to 4700 Angstrom) to know carbon isotope ratios (C-12/C-13) for
   carbon stars in the Galactic halo, named CH stars. The isotope ratios
   are obtained for 6 CH stars by the curve-of-growth analysis of the
   isolated (CN)-C-12 and (CN)-C-13 lines. In this analysis, we compared
   directly (CN)-C-12 and (CN)-C-13 lines of similar intensities
   (iso-intensity method), and the resulting C-12/C-13 ratios are almost
   independent of the model atmosphere and its parameters. The (CN)-C-13
   lines appear to be too weak in some CH stars, for which we applied the
   spectral synthesis method to the stronger C-2 Swan band, obtained
   C-12/C-13 ratios for two stars and estimated the lower limits of
   C-12/C-13 ratios for two stars. In this case, however, the results
   depend on model atmosphere and its parameters. Results from our present
   and previous works show that most of them (12 stars) distribute around
   C-12/C-13 similar to 10 and two stars have very high values (C-12/C-13
   greater than or equal to 500). The distribution of C-12/C-13 ratios in
   CH stars is different from that of the population I carbon stars as well
   as population II oxygen-rich giants (G similar to K types). The CH stars
   of very high C-12/C-13 ratios can be explained by dredge-up of C-12 due
   to 3 alpha-process as in population I carbon stars (N-type). On the
   other hand the formation of the CH stars with low C-12/C-13 ratios

that photolysis of C2H2 in the laboratory and in comets occurs via a sequential
mechanism, first producing C2H and then C2. The ab initio calculations were used
to identify the two excited electronic states (22Σ+ and 22Π) of C2H through which
photodissociation in the second step proceeds. In both the laboratory and cometary
studies, the photodissociation of C2H appears to proceed via the same electronic
surfaces. The C2 Mulliken bands obtained in the laboratory and the HST observations
of these bands are used to explain the internal energy distribution and origin
of C2(X1Σg+) in comet Hyakutake. The off nucleus HST spectrum at 16 arcsec shows
that the C2 radicals are much colder vibrationally than they are on the nucleus.
This vibrational cooling is inconsistent with literature reports and is discussed

expansion velocity of 8.5+-0.6 kms independent of excitation condition or molecular
specie. On the basis of the expansion velocity, rotational temperatures, and molecular
column densities we argue that the line-forming region is the AGB remnant. This is in
agreement with the expansion velocity derived from the CO lines. We find column
densities of log N_C2=15.3+-0.3 cm-2 and log N_CN=15.5+-0.3 cm-2, and rotational
temperatures of T_rot=242+-20 K and T_rot=24+-5 K respectively for C2 and CN.
By studying molecular line absorption in optical spectra of post-AGB stars we
have found a new tracer of the AGB remnant. From comparison with the results of
CO and IR observations it is possible to obtain information on non-spherical behavior
of the AGB remnant. Using different molecules with different excitation conditions it
should be possible to study the AGB remnant as a function of the distance to the star,
and thus as a function of the evolutionary status of the star on the AGB. },

collisional transfer between the metastable \{C2\} (5Πg, v=0) and the radiative \{C2\}
(d3Πg, v=6) level was progress. However, these authors claimed that only the combination
reaction C+C+M→C2+M should be invoked for the production of the metastable level,
excluding the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction that other authors believed to be at the origin
of the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. The correlation diagram of the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction
shows that C2(5Πg) + \{CO\} correlates with ground-state reactants while C2(d3Πg) + \{CO\}
does not. Such a reaction could thus be involved in the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. A
kinetic study of these bands in a fast-flow reactor, downstream from a microwave
discharge through \{CO\} diluted in He, demonstrated that both reactions C + C + M
and C+C2O were involved. It could be concluded that the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction has a
lower branching ratio for C2(5Πg) production than C+C+M→C2+M. However, the C+C2O
reaction has in most discharges, as in ours, a greater reaction rate than that of
the C+C+M reaction so its contribution is not negligible and may be the main one
if the dissociation rate of \{CO\} is low.},

Abstract = {Coupled-cluster methods including effects of triple excitations have
   been used with large basis sets to study several electronic states of
   C2, C2-, and C2+. r(e), omega(e), D(e), and T(e) have been computed for
   each state considered.  For those states for which experimental data
   are available, the errors are typically less than 0.002 angstrom, 20
   cm-1, and 0.1 eV for r(e), omega(e), and D(e), respectively.  These
   errors are comparable with the best previous results on C2 and
   significantly smaller than those for previous calculations on C2- and
   C2+.  For T(e) the results are also satisfactory and comparable with
   previous work, but some difficulties arise when one or both of the
   states have considerable multireference character.  For two states of
   C2+ not experimentally characterized, the present data should be
   sufficiently accurate to be of some assistance to experimental studies.
    The electron affinity of the ground state of C2 and the ionization
   potentials of the ground and first excited states of C2 have been
   computed, and particular attention has been given to correlation errors
   in these quantities.  It has been shown that triple excitations
   significantly decrease the electron affinity.  By neglecting or taking
   insufficient account of triple excitations, some previous calculations
   were biased towards the anion and obtained fortuitously good agreement
   with experiment.  The correlation error of the present calculations is
   such that the calculations are slightly biased towards the neutral
   molecule, but the error is only 0.2 eV.  For the ionization potentials,
   too, triple excitations play an important role.  Reasonable agreement
   with experiment has been achieved by the present calculations.
   Overall, the present study:  (1) underscores the importance of triple
   excitations; (2) shows the success of single-reference couple-cluster
   theory in calculating properties of a single state, even when that
   state has considerable multireference character; and (3) highlights the
   care which must be taken when comparing different electronic states
   with these methods when one or both states have considerable
   multireference character.},

   E(1)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2) of C2 and

   theoretically by using MRD-CI wave functions.  Due to a heavy mixing
   between bonding and antibonding configurations, the E state (with a
   maximum contribution of sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2 of 45\%) does not show
   the typical features of strongly bound states (short R(e) and high

   E(1)SIGMA(g)+ - A(1)PI(u) of C2 exhibits a moderate intensity though.
   At R = 2.43 bohr (an intermediate geometry between both minima), a
   calculated transition moment SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.151 au2 disagrees
   with an experimental estimate of 2.26 +/- 1.13 au2 from Cooper and
   Nicholls.  The same authors assigned to the Mulliken band D(1)SIGMA(u)+
   - X(1)SIGMA(g)+ of C2 a SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.13 +/- 0.05 au2, whereas
   this work and earlier data from the literature indicate a higher value
   of 0.41 au2 for that quantity.  A total radiative lifetime tau(0)
   almost-equal-to 15 ns for the E(1)SIGMA(g)+ state is mainly dicated by
   the radiative process E --> A, the competitive decay E --> D being
   about 10 times slower.  The 2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) state
   of C2+ is strongly bound, with a shortening DELTA-R(e) = 0.35 bohr and
   an increase DELTA-omega(e) almost-equal-to 800 cm-1 (60\%) relative to
   the X(4)SIGMA(g)- ground state.  A lifetime tau(0)(2(2)SIGMA(g)+)
   almost-equal-to 28 ns results from radiative decay into both
   1(2)SIGMA(u)+ and 2(2)PI(u) states.  On the basis of the present
   spectroscopic data for C2+, an absorption band observed at 2.77 eV
   (assumed as belonging to C2) is tentatively reassigned to the

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1990},

Pages = {6599-6603},
abstract = {We have studied the Phillips (A 1∏u–X 1∑+g ) band system of C2 in
order to help resolve the discrepancy between the best theoretical lifetimes
and those deduced recently from laser‐induced fluorescence (LIF) studies. Our
calculated lifetime for the A 1∏u(v’=0, J’=1) state is 13.0 μs, in excellent
agreement with the recent calculations of ONeil et al., but considerably shorter
than the direct experimental measurements. A measure of the accuracy of the
complete‐active‐space self‐consistent‐field (CASSCF) multireference configuration‐interaction
(MRCI) results in this work is obtained by a series of calibration calculations.
Convergence in the n‐particle space is demonstrated by comparison with full
configuration interaction calculations in a double‐zeta plus polarization basis,
while the convergence of the one‐particle basis set is demonstrated by systematically
expanding the one‐particle basis set up through g angular momentum functions.
Furthermore, a coupling of the one‐ and n‐particle spaces is shown to be unimportant
by systematically expanding the active space in the CASSCF/MRCI treatment.
Given that our theoretical results are estimated to be accurate to about 5%,
the LIF lifetimes would appear to contain some systematic error.},

abstract = {The magnetic rotation observation of the \{C2\} b3Σg− ← a3Πu Ballik-Ramsay
system using a color center laser is reported. This is the first detection of this
system in absorption. Three bands, 0 ← 1, 1 ← 2, and 2 ← 3, were identified in the
spectral range 3650–4030 cm−1. The last two bands were observed for the first time.
In magnetic rotation many satellite lines (ΔN ≠ ΔJ) which would be very weak in normal
absorption have been observed with intensity comparable to the main branch lines.
This permits a slight improvement in the accuracy of some of the fine structure constants.
A variety of lineshapes are observed for the various branches by magnetic rotation.
Because the b3Σg− fine structure is small, giving a partial overlap, the peak frequency
of a magnetic rotation signal usually does not correspond to the center frequency
of the normal absorption signal of that transition. A computer program has been
written to predict magnetic rotation lineshapes and obtain the peak frequency
displacements. Various observed and calculated lineshapes are displayed and compared.},

Journal = JPC,

abstract = {The authors have measured the translational energy release for
processes C2H2 193 nm/ C2H + H (I) and C2H 193 nm/ C2 + H (II) using the molecular
time-of-flight method. By measuring the maximum release of translational energy
for process I it has been determined that the C-H bond energy in acetylene, D0(C2H-H),
is 132 +/- 2 kcal/mol. Since the translational energy distribution peaks well away
from zero, it is quite unlikely that internal conversion of the electronically
excited C2H2 is an important channel for dissociation in channel I. Because of
the relatively small amount of energy appearing as product rotation, it is possible
to get information on the vibrational structure of C2H radical from the translational
energy distribution and it is found that the bending frequency in C2H is 550 +/- 100 cm .
This experiment is consistent with earlier work which observed C2( /sub u/) in
fluorescence. 21 references, 20 figures, 3 tables.},

C2 to CN ratio, which decreases roughly as r-1.4 out to r ≅ 1.8 AU and then falls
precipitously. Although there is considerable chemical uniformity in most comets
studied, two (P/Borrelly and P/Swift-Gehrels) appear significantly deficient in
both C2 and C3. The apparent systematics within the crude Haser paradigm offer
suggestions for more realistic chemical modelling studies.},

(DA. C1Πg-A1Πu) and Phillips (A1Πu-X1Σg-) band systems known from its molecular
spectrum. Good agreement is found between calculation and experiment for bond
lengths, vibrational frequencies and Tc values characterizing the pertinent C2
electronic states. The intensity computed for the Ballik-Ramsay transition is
also in good accord with that found in shock-tube measurements by Cooper and
Nicholls (CN), a result which is consistent with experience obtained in studying
other triplet-triplet transitions of C2 such as the Swan and Fox-Herzberg bands.
For the corresponding singlet-singlet transitions there is notably larger variance
between the presently calculated lifetimes and intensities and those inferred by
experiment, whereby in these cases different measurements are often found to disagree
with one another. In the case of the Mulliken system the calculated ∫ value agrees
well with an early measurement of Smith but is larger by a factor of three than that
obtained in the more recent CN shock-tube experiments. The DA computed intensity
is also roughly three times greater than measured by CN, but in the case of the
Phillips bands the corresponding comparison between calculations and experiment
is better, with the computed lifetimes of the 1Πu upper state as a function of ν′
lying between the respective measured data of CN and Hubrich et al. A possible
source of the above discrepancies is suggested to involve cascading effects from
high-lying singlet species into the upper states of the Mulliken. DA and Phillips
systems, especially since analogously competing allowed transitions are notably
lacking in the C2 triplet manifold for which the agreement between calculated
and measured lifetimes and intensities is generally good.},

the observation of the corresponding system using 13CH4 instead of 12CH4. Neither
the upper nor the lower state is one of the known states of C2. None of the predicted
low-lying states of C2 fits the observed new states. Two possibilities remain: either
the new system corresponds to two fairly highly excited levels of C2 or it is due
to the C2− ion. The latter alternative finds some support in the similarity of
the new system to the near ultraviolet bands of N2+ (which has the same number
of electrons). However, the doublet splitting required by this interpretation has
not been resolved, nor has the study of perturbations in the upper state given
clear-cut evidence for doublet structure. On the other hand, a mass-spectrometric
investigation of the ions in the flash discharge producing the spectrum shows a
strong C2− peak, while C2+ is weak. A definitive answer to the question of the

the intensity of two unresolved-triplet, rotational lines of C11C12(1, 0). The
structure of the isotope band has been computed to obtain the number of lines
forming the observed head. From the theory of the excitation of comet lines by
resonance fluorescence, we derive the isotope ratio C11/C11 as 70 + 15. Solar-absorption
features, although included, modify the excitation pattern of the C1 lines only slightly,
unlike the CN band which has strongly deficient solar radiation. A feature at 4752 appears
near C13C13(1, 0). Its strength is too great to be compatible with C11/C13 70, requiring
an unacceptably low value. A discussion as to whether C11C13 can be de-excited by pure
rotation, unlike the homonuclear C11 molecules, leads to no definite conclusion since
the dipole moment of C12C11 is unknown. We believe that x 4752 is largely affected by
a blend with NH1. Another slight blend, at X 4745, may require a slightly higher
isotope ratio C11/C13. The C /C13 ratio is near that on the earth. Some implications
for the early history of the solar system are drawn. If the solar C12/C13 ratio proves

The (0-2), (1-3), (2-4), and (3-5) bands of the ~v = -2 sequence have also been
analyzed, in order to complete the analysis of low vibrational levels. All the
available material on the Swan bands was then used to obtain improved molecular
constants for the two electronic states. These are given in Table 14. A linear
extrapolation of the vibrational quanta of the upper (A ~ll~) state gives 5.30 e.v.
as an upper limit for the dissociation energy of this electronic state. Depending
upon whether it dissociates into (3P -~- 3P) atoms or (3P -I- `D) atoms, the upper
limit to the heat of dissociation of C2 is 5.30 or 4.04 e.v },

abstract = {The subdivisions of spectral classes R and N do not appear to represent
a consistent progression in temperature. In order to set up a more definite
temperature sequence, a new classification is suggested on the basis of four criteria: (i)
atomic line ratios which are sensitive to temperature changes; (2) inten- sity gradient
of the continuous spectrum in the yellow and red regions; (3) strength of the D-lines
of so- dium; and (~) intensity gradient within the X 5635-bafld group of the molecule C2.
In the new classification the double maximum shown by the C2 bands in the R-N system
disappears and is replaced by a single broad maximum. The "lithium" star, WZ Cassiopeiae,
whose spectral type in the R-N system is Nip is reclassii5ed at the low-temperature end
of the carbon sequence; it appears to be the coolest carbon star known, and the great
strength of Li may possibly be explained. A group of five carbon stars has been found
which is characterized by extreme weakness of the atomic lines in the photographic region.
The bands of CH occur with great strength in their spectra; in addition, all five stars
have very high radial velocities. The intensities of the carbon bands vary greatly among
stars of the same subclass; this is probably to be considered as evidence of different
abundances of carbon in the atmospheres of different stars },

and other investigators and measured by Hori, who attributed it to a C3 molecule,

consists of superposed (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) headless bands of a Σ→Σ transition
of C2 (or possibly C+2), in agreement with the earlier diagnosis of Mulliken and Dieke.
Alternate lines are missing in each series, as expected in view of the zero spin of
the carbon nucleus. Most probably the transition is 1Σ+u→1Σ+g of C2. The molecular
constants are very nearly equal for the upper and lower electronic states. They
correspond rather closely to the average values of the same constants for other
known states of C2. The following values were obtained for the more important
constants: B′e=1.8334 cm−1, B''e=1.8223 cm−1, α′=0.0204, α''=0.0195, r′e=1.2382 A,

abstract = {Since its discovery by W. Swan almost exactly seventy years ago,
speculations as to the origin of this familiar band spectrum have been prolific
in spectroscopic literature. A good summary of these opinions and the experimental
data upon which they were founded is given by Watts (1), writing in 1914. With the
exception of one or two writers, the two opposing schools have favoured a Carbon
molecule and a Hydrocarbon molecule, respectively. The latter school have for the
most part specified in particular an acetylene molecule. Thus among a vast number
of experimenters Van der Willigen (1859), Attfield (1862-1875), Dibbits (1864),
Morren (1865), Plucker and Hittorf (1865), Huggins (1868), Wullner (1872),
Salet (1873), Secchi (1873), Ciamician (1880), Deslandres (1888), and Eder (1890),
favoured a carbon molecule (presumably Ca). On the other hand Swan (1856),
Angstrom and Thalen (1875), Liveing and Dewar (1880), and many others favoured
a hydrocarbon. The latter writers conducted a great deal of careful research (2)
on the flames of Carbon compounds, the vacuum tube spectra of Carbon gases, and
the Carbon arc in various gases, and they affirm that the emitter is an acetylene
molecule, since this gas can be withdrawn from the flames of burning hydrocarbons
which, show the bands well. In the light of our present knowledge one or two comments
are suggested as we review all this work. It is clear that in the vast quantity of
experimental work of the former school the extraordinary difficulty of ensuring the
complete absence of Hydrogen—either occluded in the carbons or present as water
vapour—was not appreciated. We have, for example, a similar and comparatively recent
controversy (3) with reference to the origin of the Nitrogen afterglow, in which the
degree of freedom from Oxygen of a sample of Nitrogen was the point at issue. Another
very natural idea which prevailed until recently was that the emitters of band spectra
were necessarily molecules known to chemistry, the most stable ones being those most
likely to radiate under discharge conditions. Our present views are almost the reverse
of these, and it seems probable that polar molecules cannot radiate band spectra at all.
An excellent paper representative of these views has recently been published by Mulliken (4)—“On
a class of one-valence electron emitters.” The old ideas, therefore, which led to the
choice of an acetylene molecule as the radiator of the Swan bands were certainly ill-founded,
but by a coincidence it happens that a C2H2 molecule must now be quite definitely accepted
as their emitter. The present paper contains the evidence for this statement. Hitherto
measurements of the fine structure of only three heads have been available, and these
from photographs take under arc conditions. It has been found desirable to make a
complete re-measurement of the fine structure of these and other heads under new
low temperature conditions of production. Some 2,000 lines are tabulated. A
considerable number of these have been given series assignment, and the modern
quantum theory of band spectra in its various aspects has been applied to the data.
The scope of the resulting analysis may be gauged from the table of contents.},
