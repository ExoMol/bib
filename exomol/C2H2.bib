Title = {High-temperature measurements of acetylene {VUV} absorption cross sections
   and application to warm exoplanet atmospheres},
Journal =AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {693},
Abstract = {Context. Most observed exoplanets have high equilibrium temperatures
   (T-eq > 500 K). Understanding the chemistry of their atmospheres and
   interpreting their observations requires the use of chemical kinetic
   models including photochemistry. The thermal dependence of the vacuum
   ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of molecules used in these
   models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to uncertainties in
   the resulting abundance profiles.
   Aims. The aim of our work is to study experimentally the thermal
   dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of molecules of interest for
   exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for use in atmospheric
   models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2).Methods. We measured
   absorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296
   to 773 K recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV
   spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D
   thermo-photochemical model, to assess their impact on the predicted
   composition of a generic hot Jupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere.
   Results. The absolute absorption cross sections of C2H2 increase with
   temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115 to 185 nm and
   rises sharply from 185 to 230 nm. The abundance profile of C2H2
   calculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum
   decrease of 40\% near 5 x 10(-5) bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross
   sections measured at 773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained
   by the absorption, higher in the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from
   150 to 230 nm due to the increase in the C2H2 absorption in this
   spectral range. This change also impacts the abundance profiles of other
   by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene (C2H4).
   Conclusions. We present the first experimental measurements of the VUV
   absorption cross sections of C2H2 at high temperatures. Similar studies
   of other major species are needed to improve our understanding of
   exoplanet atmospheres.},

Title = {Role of Acetylene in the Chemical Evolution of Carbon Complexity},
Journal = {ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Abstract = {Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space,
   plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by
   its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the
   simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In
   addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the
   most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning
   from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold
   interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes
   where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors
   collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the
   molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in
   space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion
   of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of
   simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and
   ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms
   pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and
   cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres,
   are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of
   acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is
   accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research
   into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a
   significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in
   the Universe. The insights garnered from this review underscore the
   significance of acetylene in astrochemistry and potentially contribute
   to our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe.},

Title = {Ro-vibrational levels and their ( e-f ) splitting of acetylene molecule
   calculated from new potential energy surfaces},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {292},
Abstract = {Ro-vibrational energy levels of acetylene are reported using variational
   nuclear motion calculations from new ab initio and empirically optimized
   full six-dimensional potential energy surfaces in the ground electronic
   state of the acetylene molecule. The calculations account for the
   triple, quadruple and quintuple excitations as well as relativistic and
   diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections. Variational nuclear motion
   calculations were performed using the exact kinetic energy operator in
   orthogonal coordinates. The convergence of energy levels calculations
   versus the size of the vibrational basis set functions was verified. Our
   best ab initio potential energy surface that includes the
   above-mentioned contributions provides the RMS (obs.-calc.) errors of
   0.95 cm -1 for five fundamental energy levels. The largest contribution
   to the RMS error is caused primarily by a significant deviation of the
   nu 4 fundamental frequency. Experimental values of 120 vibrational band
   origins were used to empirically adjust few lower-order parameters of
   the potential energy surface. The average error drops down to 0.45 cm -1
   or 0.25 cm -1 for empirically optimized potential energy function with
   two or seven adjusted parameters corresponding to quadratic force field
   terms and one third order term. The splitting of ( e - f ) rovibrational
   doublets and their J dependence were calculated with high accuracy due
   to the full account of Coriolis interactions. Computed ( e - f )
   splittings allow one to check the correctness of the assignment of
   empirical energy levels. The estimation of the accuracy for the
   calculated vibrational levels in an extended range up to 9500 cm -1
   shows that the set of ab initio vibrational levels can be used for
   future assignments of empirically not observed ro-vibrational energy
   levels. The comparison of the calculated and experimental ro-vibrational
   energy levels of the C 2 D 2 and 13 C 2 H 2 isotopologues is also
   reported.},

   phase-Fourier transform pulse shaping constraints and effects of

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {156},
Abstract = {We propose a methodology to tackle the laser control of a non-stationary
   dark ro-vibrational state of acetylene (C2H2), given realistic
   experimental limitations in the 7.7 mu m (1300 cm(-1)) region.
   Simulations are performed using the Lindblad master equation, where the
   so-called Lindblad parameters are used to describe the effect of the
   environment in the dilute gas phase. A phenomenological representation
   of the parameters is used, and they are extracted from high-resolution
   spectroscopy line broadening data. An effective Hamiltonian is used for
   the description of the system down to the rotational level close to
   experimental accuracy. The quality of both the Hamiltonian and Lindblad
   parameters is assessed by a comparison of a calculated infrared spectrum
   with the available experimental data. A single shaped laser pulse is
   used to perform the control, where elements of optics and pulse shaping
   using masks are introduced with emphasis on experimental limitations.
   The optimization procedure, based on gradients, explicitly takes into
   account the experimental constraints. Control performances are reported
   for shaping masks of increasing complexity. Although modest performances
   are obtained, mainly due to the strong pulse shaping constraints, we
   gain insights into the control mechanism. This work is the first step
   toward the conception of a realistic experiment that will allow for
   population characterization and manipulation of a non-stationary
   vibrational ``dark `` state. Effects of the collisions on the laser
   control in the dilute gas phase, leading to decoherence in the molecular
   system, are clearly shown.},

   smaller than previous measurements by Fourier transform spectroscopy

Abstract = {Nowadays, buffer-gas cooling represents an invaluable option to produce
   cold stable molecules, both in view of secondary cooling/trapping
   strategies towards the achievement of quantum degeneracy and for
   fundamental studies of complex molecules. From this follows a demand to
   establish a pool of specialized, increasingly precise spectroscopic
   interrogation techniques. Here, we demonstrate a general approach to
   Lamb-dip ro-vibrational spectroscopy of buffergas-cooled molecules. The
   saturation intensity of the selected molecular transition is achieved by
   coupling the probe laser to a high-finesse optical cavity surrounding
   the cold sample. A cavity ring-down technique is then implemented to
   perform saturation sub-Doppler measurements as the buffer (He) and
   molecular gas flux are varied. As an example, the (v(1) + v(3)) R(1)
   ro-vibrational line in a 20 Kelvin acetylene sample is addressed. By
   referencing the probe laser to a Rb/GPS dock, the corresponding
   line-center frequency as well as the self and foreign (i.e., due to the
   buffer gas) collisional broadening coefficients are absolutely
   determined. Our approach represents an important step towards the
   development of a novel method to perform ultra-precise ro-vibrational
   spectroscopy on an extremely wide range of cold molecules. In this
   respect, we finally discuss a number of relevant upgrades underway in
   the experimental setup to considerably improve the ultimate

Abstract = {The absorption spectra of acetylene (HCCH) and vinylidene (H2CC) as well
   as their deuterated isotopologues are investigated theoretically on a
   near spectroscopically accurate full-dimensional potential energy
   surface reported in an earlier publication, using dipole moment surfaces
   reported in this work, which are constructed with a neural network
   method from a large number of ab initio data points. These global
   surfaces cover not only the deep acetylene well but also the vinylidene
   well, as well as the transition region between the two isomers. The
   agreement with available experimental data for acetylene is excellent,
   validating both the potential energy surface and the dipole moment
   surfaces. The infrared spectra of vinylidene and its deuterated
   isotopologues are predicted. The potential and dipole moment surfaces
   lay the foundation for future spectroscopic studies of the
   acetylene-vinylidene isomerization involving large-amplitude motions.},

journal = ApJ,

abstract = {We present high spectral resolution observations from 12.96 to 13.33
microns toward Orion IRc2 using the mid-infrared spectrograph, Echelon-Cross-Echelle
Spectrograph (EXES), at Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).
These observations probe the physical and chemical conditions of the Orion hot core,
which is sampled by a bright, compact, mid-infrared background continuum source
in the region, IRc2. All 10 of the rovibrational C2H2 transitions expected in our
spectral coverage are detected with high signal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns), yielding
continuous coverage of the R-branch lines from J = 9–8 to J = 18–17, including
both ortho and para species. Eight of these rovibrational transitions are newly
reported detections. The isotopologue, 13CCH2, is clearly detected with a high S/N.
This enabled a direct measurement of the 12C/13C isotopic ratio for the Orion hot
core of 14 ± 1 and an estimated maximum value of 21. We also detected several HCN
rovibrational lines. The ortho and para C2H2 ladders are clearly separate, and
tracing two different temperatures, 226 K and 164 K, respectively, with a non-equilibrium
ortho to para ratio (OPR) of 1.7 ± 0.1. Additionally, the ortho and para V LSR
values differ by about 1.8 ± 0.2 km s−1, while the mean line widths differ by 0.7 ± 0.2
km s−1, suggesting that these species are not uniformly mixed along the line of
ight to IRc2. We propose that the abnormally low C2H2 OPR could be a remnant from
an earlier, colder phase, before the density enhancement (now the hot core) was
impacted by shocks generated from an explosive event 500 years ago.},

   Measurements of the observed sub-Doppler line widths as a function of
   pressure showed that the self-pressure-broadening coefficients are about
   3.5 times larger than those derived from conventional pressure
   broadening of unsaturated Doppler-limited spectra. This is attributed to
   the contribution of velocity-changing collisions to the total dephasing
   rate in the low pressure sub-Doppler measurements. At higher pressures,
   when the homogeneous broadening becomes comparable to the typical
   Doppler shift per elastic collision, the velocity changing collisions
   cease to contribute significantly to the incremental pressure
   broadening. A time-dependent soft collision model is developed to
   illustrate the transition between low and high pressure regimes of
   sub-Doppler pressure-broadening.},

absorptions, mainly by methane, and scattering by aerosols, except in a few
"transparency windows." Thus, the composition of Titan's surface remains difficult
to access from space and is still poorly constrained. Photochemical models suggest
that most of the organic compounds formed in the atmosphere are heavy enough to
condense and build up at the surface in liquid and solid states over geological
timescales. Acetylene (C2H2) net production in the atmosphere is predicted to be
larger than any other compound and C2H2 has been speculated to exist on the
surface of Titan. C2H2 was detected as a trace gas sublimated/evaporated from
the surface using the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer after the landing of
the Huygens probe. Here we show evidence of C2H2 on the surface of Titan by
detecting absorption bands at 1.55 and 4.93 μm using the Cassini Visual and Infrared
Mapping Spectrometer at three different equatorial areas—Tui Regio, eastern Shangri La,
and Fensal–Aztlan/Quivira. We found that C2H2 is preferentially detected in low-albedo
areas, such as sand dunes and near the Huygens landing site. The specific location
of the C2H2 detections suggests that C2H2 is mobilized by surface processes, such as
surface weathering by liquids through dissolution/evaporation processes.},

strength of the mid-infrared transition result in efficient population transfer
to the intermediate state, which allows measuring secondary transitions from this

from the intermediate state is probed using cavity ring-down spectroscopy, which
provides high sensitivity in this wavelength region. Due to the narrow linewidths

unreported symmetric vibrational state of acetylene, ν1+ν2+ν3+ν14+ν−15 in the normal

state are forbidden. Ten lines of the newly measured state are observed and fitted

the three cold bands of 12C13CH2 are reported for the first time. The new data

the line positions (typical rms values are on the order of 0.001 cm−1). A few
of the analyzed bands were found to be affected by rovibrational perturbations,
which are discussed. In particular, the rotational structure of the 2ν1 + (ν4 + ν5)0
Σu+–Σg+ band near 7994 cm−1 exhibits a particularly surprising intensity distribution:
while the P(19) and R(17) transitions share the same J = 18 upper level, the R(17)
line has an intensity about 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the P(19) line. This
unusual situation is quantitatively interpreted as resulting from a Coriolis interaction
between the ν1 + 2ν2 + ν51 and 2ν1 + (ν4 + ν5)0 bands with a energy crossing at J = 18.
The accidental nearly perfect cancelation of the two terms contributing to the line
strength of the R(17) line leads to the near disappearance of this line.},

vibrational energy levels have been calculated using the Lanczos algorithm with
an exact (J = 0) Hamiltonian. The vibrational energies up to 12 700 cm−1 above

In addition, analyses of the wavefunctions confirm the experimentally observed
emergence of the local bending and counter-rotational modes in the highly excited
bending vibrational states. The reproduction of the experimentally derived effective
Hamiltonians for highly excited bending states signals the coming of age for the
ab initio based PES, which can now be trusted for studying the isomerization reaction.},

Abstract = {We have carried out an investigation of the chemical evolution of gas in
   different carbon-rich circumstellar environments. Previous studies have
   tended to invoke terrestrial flame chemistries, based on acetylene
   (C2H2) combustion to model the formation of carbon dust, via polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this work, we pay careful attention to
   the accurate calculation of the molecular photoreaction rate
   coefficients to ascertain whether there is a universal formation
   mechanism for carbon dust in strongly irradiated astrophysical
   environments. A large number of possible chemical channels may exist for
   the formation of PAHs, so we have concentrated on the viability of the
   formation of the smallest building block species, C2H2, in a variety of
   carbon-rich stellar outflows. C2H2 is very sensitive to dissociation by
   UV radiation. This sensitivity is tested, using models of the
   time-dependent chemistry. We find that C2H2 formation is sensitive to
   some of the physical parameters and that in some known sources of dust
   formation it can never attain appreciable abundances. Therefore,
   multiple (and currently ill-defined) dust-formation channels must exist.},

of the stable isotope fractionation of reactants and products attributed to enzymatic

We propose that this approach might be applied to study the origin and fate of
organic compounds contained in water vapor plumes emanating from Enceladus or
other icy bodies, perhaps revealing information about the potential for biology
occurring within a sub-surface "habitable" zone. Methanol and C2-hydrocarbons
including ethylene, ethane and acetylene (C2H2) have been identified in the plumes
of Enceladus. Biological degradation of acetylene proceeds by anaerobic fermentation
via acetylene hydratase through acetaldehyde, with a second enzyme (acetaldehyde
dismutase) forming acetate and ethanol. We found that incubation of cultures of
acetylene-fermenting bacteria exhibit a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) associated
with the net removal of C2H2. Consumption of acetylene by both growing and washed-cell
cultures of bacteria closely related to Pelobacter acetylenicus (e.g, strain SFB93)
was accompanied by a carbon isotopic fractionation of about 2 per mil (KIE = 1.8-2.7 ‰),
a result we are examining with other cultures of acetylene fermenters. In addition,
we are measuring the carbon isotopic composition of acetaldehyde, ethanol and acetate
during fermentation to learn whether these products are fractionated sufficiently,
relative to their substrate, to warrant measurement of their isotopic composition
in Enceladus (or Europa) plumes to indicate enzymatic activity in liquid environments
below the crust of these moons.},

plasmas used in most diamond chemical vapor deposition) accounts for the finding
that CH4/CO2/H2 plasmas can yield similar maximal gas temperatures and diamond
growth rates at lower input powers than traditional CH4/H2 plasmas. The plasma
chemistry and composition is seen to switch upon changing from oxygen-rich (XC/Σ < 0.5)
to carbon-rich (XC/Σ > 0.5) source gas mixtures and, by comparing CH4/CO2/H2 (XC/Σ = 0.5)

different prevailing gas activation mechanisms), in contrast to C/H process gas
mixtures. CH3 radicals are identified as the most abundant C1Hx [x = 0–3] species
near the growing diamond surface within the process window for successful diamond
growth (XC/Σ ≈ 0.5–0.54) identified by Bachmann et al. (Diamond Relat. Mater.1991, 1, 1).

   previously unreported sub-states, or extend assignments in 35 already
   known sub-bands. A global fit procedure of line positions from the full

   assigned, was performed, accessing vibrational states up to 8900 cm$^{-1}$.
   Coriolis interactions were systematically introduced in the global
   Hamiltonian, which also accounted for higher order vibrational constants
   and considered the role of higher excited bending states than before.
   The dimensionless standard deviation of the fit was 1.07 and 396

analysis up to 8600 cm$^{-1}$}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {106},

Abstract = {The absorption spectrum of $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ has been recorded using cavity
   ringdown spectroscopy and analyzed in the ranges 6000 - 6356 cm-1 and
   6667-7015 cm-1. Fourteen new bands have been identified and additional
   J-lines were assigned in 10 already known bands. These new data,
   together with the published vibration-rotation absorption lines of
   $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ accessing vibrational states up to 8600 cm-1 have been gathered
   in a database. The resulting set includes 12137 transitions involving
   186 different k = l4 + l5 sub-states, with li the angular momentum
   quantum number associated to the i degenerate bending vibration. These
   lines have been fitted simultaneously to spectroscopic parameters
   through J-dependent Hamiltonian matrices exploiting the vibrational
   polyad or cluster block-diagonalization, in terms of the pseudo-quantum
   numbers Nr = 5v1 + 3v2 + 5v3+v4+v5 and Ns = v1 + v2 + v3, also
   accounting for k and e/f parities and u/g symmetry. Modes 1 and 2
   correspond to the symmetric CH and CC stretchings, mode 3 to the
   antisymmetric CH stretch, and modes 4 and 5 to the trans- and
   cis-degenerate bendings, respectively. The fit was successfully
   achieved, with a dimensionless standard deviation of 0.92, leading to
   the determination of 266 effective vibration-rotation parameters.},

primordial earth and in the outer solar system}},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {45-58},
Abstract = {Acetylene occurs, by photolysis of methane, in the atmospheres of jovian
planets and Titan. In contrast, acetylene is only a trace component of
Earth's current atmosphere. Nonetheless, a methane-rich atmosphere has
been hypothesized for early Earth; this atmosphere would also have been
rich in acetylene. This poses a paradox, because acetylene is a potent
inhibitor of many key anaerobic microbial processes, including
methanogenesis, anaerobic methane oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and
hydrogen oxidation. Fermentation of acetylene was discovered similar to
25 years ago, and Pelobacter acetylenicus was shown to grow on acetylene
by virtue of acetylene hydratase, which results in the formation of
acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde subsequently dismutates to ethanol and
acetate ( plus some hydrogen). However, acetylene hydratase is specific
for acetylene and does not react with any analogous compounds. We
hypothesize that microbes with acetylene hydratase played a key role in
the evolution of Earth's early biosphere by exploiting an available
source of carbon from the atmosphere and in so doing formed protective
niches that allowed for other microbial processes to flourish.
Furthermore, the presence of acetylene in the atmosphere of a planet or
planetoid could possibly represent evidence for an extraterrestrial
anaerobic ecosystem.},

   branch (AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the

   over the 5-38 $\mu$m range. All 26 low-resolution spectra show acetylene
   (C2H2) bands at 7 and 14 $\mu$m. The hydrogen cyanide (HCN) bands at these
   wavelengths are very weak or absent. This is consistent with low
   nitrogen abundances in the LMC. The observed 14 $\mu$m C2H2 band is
   reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 K. There is no
   clear dilution of the 14 $\mu$m C2H2 band by circumstellar dust emission.
   This 14-$\mu$m band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar
   envelope in these high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous
   findings for Galactic stars. The C2H2 column density, derived from the
   13.7 $\mu$m band, shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3 x 10(-6) to 5
   x 10(-5) M-circle dot yr(-1). This is comparable with the total
   mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from the spectral energy
   distribution. Additionally, we compare the line strengths of the 13.7 mu
   m C2H2 band of our LMC sample with those of a Galactic sample. Despite
   the low metallicity of the LMC, there is no clear difference in the C2H2
   abundance among LMC and Galactic stars. This reflects the effect of the
   third dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to
   high carbon-to-oxygen ratio at low metallicity.},

nebulae in order to explain the high abundance of polyynes, cyanopolyynes, methyl-polyynes,
benzene, and other C-bearing species found in CRL 618 by Cernicharo et al. In the
neutral regions behind the H II region, the radiation field produces a rich
photochemistry on timescales shorter than the dynamical evolution of the central
H II region, leading to the formation of large carbon-rich molecules CnH2, HC(2n+1)N,
and Cn. Reactions between radicals H and H2 play a crucial role in maintaining a
high abundance for these species in spite of the strong radiation field emerging
from the central star. The models predict that proto-planetary nebulae in the early
stages of evolution will have high abundances for species such as HC(2n+1)N, CnH4,
and CnH3N. The role of reactions between neutrals and radicals in the growth of
aromatic molecules is discussed. The large abundance derived for small cumulenes
suggests that the growth of small carbon grains with C/H Gt 1 could be dominated
by reactions between polyynes and cumulenes. The models also explain the observed
abundances of H2CO, OH, H2O, CO2, and [O I] in the region where CO is photodissociated.},

signal-to-noise ratio has been achieved in the wave-number region 2900–3500 cm−1
by taking advantage of directionality of the fluorescence signal. The improvement
has been applied to overtone spectroscopy of normal acetylene where for high CH
stretching excitations separate spectra of ortho and para forms are obtained containing
basically just single CH stretching vibrational quantum transitions from the
pumped antisymmetric vibrational (ν1+3ν3(Σ+u) and ν2+3ν3(Σ+u)) and close-lying
symmetric vibrational local mode (4ν3(Σ+g) and ν1+ν2+2ν3(Σ+g)) states. No nuclear
spin conversion is observed in these spectra. Two new symmetric vibrational states
(ν1+2ν2+4ν04(Σ+g)(29%) and (50%)) have been observed and the precision of the
spectroscopic parameters of previously published symmetric states has been improved
by an order of magnitude. Unexpected fluorescence originating from the antisymmetric
CH stretching fundamental state ν3 and some associated states of acetylene have also
been observed. These spectra are characterized by both ortho and para forms in
normal abundance and by unusual intensity patterns due to strong reabsorption of
the fluorescence by ground state acetylene molecules in the sample cell. A simple
collisional step-down mechanism is proposed to account for the appearance of the
ν3 fluorescence band system. The excess vibrational energy in the sample volume
is partly trapped in the form of ν3 mode energy and it decays from the system by
radiation.},

effective model Hamiltonians, i.e., a pure-bend effective Hamiltonian and a stretch–bend
effective Hamiltonian. The stretch–bend effective Hamiltonian is expressed in terms
of 31 Dunham expansion parameters and 11 anharmonic resonance parameters associated
with (i) five stretch–bend anharmonic resonances; (ii) one stretch–stretch and
two bend–bend Darling–Dennison resonances; and (iii) one vibrational l resonance.
The parameters in this Hamiltonian were determined from a least-squares fit of 287

level from stimulated Raman, 13 levels from stimulated emission pumping (SEP),
and 34 levels from UV-DF spectroscopy) below 10 000 cm−1 with a standard deviation
of σ=1.21 cm−1. The FC patterns for the v″4=odd ungerade levels, (0,v″2,0,v″4,1),
in the IR-UV-DF spectra were derived, and the nodes along the v″4 trans-bend mode
were found at v″4=11 via the 2ν′3+ν′6 upper state, and at v″4=9 and 15 via the 3ν′3+ν′6
upper state, which is consistent with the ν′3 dependence of the FC patterns observed

the vibrational ground state are observed and rotationally analysed. All corresponding
excited vibrational levels were assigned using the polyad model, the so-called
cluster model (El Idrissi, M.I., Liévin, J., Campargue, A., and Herman, M., 1999,
J. chem. Phys., 110, 2074) which allows vibrational energies, rotational Bv constants
and, to some respect, relative band intensities to be predicted. Additional data
and constants are also provided in the range 7600–9200cm−1, whenever improving the
literature results, from spectra recorded previously at ULB using Fourier transform
spectroscopy. The assignment procedure in the range recorded by ICLAS is detailed,
leading to a deeper understanding of vibration-rotation and intensity features of
the absorption bands within the frame of the cluster model.},

abstract = {During our open and discretionary time ISO programs we have observed
a number of carbon-rich and oxygen-rich AGB stars. We present here a hydrostatic
analysis of 3 carbon rich stars, TX Psc, V460 Cyg, and TT Cyg, which show only
modest variability. We identify absorption features of the molecules C_2, CN, CH,
CO, CS, HCN, C_2H_2, and C_3 in the three stars. The relative intensities of the
corresponding bands put strict limits on the possible values of T_eff, log g,
and C/O. In particular the ratio of the intensity of the 3 mu m band (due to HCN
and C_2H_2) and the 5 mu m band (due to CO and C_3) is a sensitive measure of the
C/O ratio. We show that our model atmospheres and corresponding synthetic spectra
are able to reproduce the observed spectra quite accurately from the visual region
through the infrared out to approximately 10 mu m. Beyond 10 mu m the flux in the
observed spectra increases compared to the computed spectra, and the photospheric
14 mu m band dominated by C_2H_2 and HCN is almost absent in the observed spectra
whereas it is very strong in the synthetic ones. This discrepancy is not an artefact
in the reduction or in the SWS response function, but a physical phenomenon in
the stars, which does not appear in oxygen-rich giants. We exclude a so-called ``warm
molecular envelope'' as an explanation of the discrepancies, and suggest that the
flux excess at long wavelengths can be interpreted as clumps of ~ 500 K dense
material which obscures about 10% of the photosphere. Weak spectral features seen
around 13.7 mu m can be understood as even cooler gas, rich in C_2H_2, above the
clumps. Other possible models to explain the long wavelength discrepancy between
the computed and observed spectra need to be explored too. Based on observations

leads us to believe that we are observing couplings to the full density of vibrational
states one would expect from acetylene in this energy region. Despite the high
resolution of our spectrometer, and the high excitation energy, no evidence for
acetylene hydrogen permutation exchange isomerization (which is predicted to proceed
through the vinylidene minimum on the potential) has been observed, implying that
the rate of exchange isomerization is more than four orders-of-magnitude below

patterns of these bright states can be adequately described in terms of a system
of 4 interacting zero-order states which are coupled by Darling-Dennison bending

method (coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions and quasiperturbative
inclusion of connected triple excitations) with a variety of one-particle basis
sets of the atomic natural orbital, correlation consistent, and augmented correlation
consistent types. The harmonic πg bending frequency ω4 and the corresponding
anharmonicity ω4−ν4 are both found to be extremely sensitive to the basis set used,
in particular to the presence of a sufficient complement of diffuse functions.
(Due to symmetry cancellation, the corresponding effect on the πu mode, i.e., ω5
and ω5−ν5, is much weaker.) Similar phenomena are observed more generally in bending
modes for molecules that possess carbon–carbon multiple bonds. Tentative explanations
are advanced. Our best computed quartic force field, which combines CCSD(T)/[6s5p4d3f2g/4s3p2d1f]
anharmonicities with a geometry and harmonic frequencies that additionally include
inner-shell correlation effects, reproduces the observed fundamentals for HCCH,
HCCD, DCCD, H13CCH, and H13C13CH with a mean absolute error of 1.3 cm−1, and the

acetylene}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {676-691},
Abstract = {The quartic force field of acetylene was determined using the CCSD(T)
method (coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions and
quasiperturbative inclusion of connected triple excitations) with a
variety of one-particle basis sets of the atomic natural orbital,
correlation consistent, and augmented correlation consistent types. The
harmonic pi(g) bending frequency omega(4) and the corresponding
anharmonicity omega(4)-nu(4) are both found to be extremely sensitive to
the basis set used, in particular to the presence of a sufficient
complement of diffuse functions, (Due to symmetry cancellation, the
corresponding effect on the pi(u) mode, i.e., omega(5) and
omega(5)-nu(5), is much weaker.) Similar phenomena are observed more
generally in bending modes for molecules that possess carbon-carbon
multiple bonds. Tentative explanations are advanced, Our best computed
quartic force field, which combines CCSD(T)/{[}6s5p4d3f2g/4s3p2d1f]
anharmonicities with a geometry and harmonic frequencies that
additionally include inner-shell correlation effects, reproduces the
observed fundamentals for HCCH, HCCD, DCCD, (HCCH)-C-13, and
(HCCH)-C-13-C-13 with a mean absolute error of 1.3 cm$^{-1}$, and the
equilibrium rotational constant to four decimal places, without any
empirical adjustment. Anharmonicity and quartic resonance constants are
in excellent agreement with the recent determination of Temsamani and
Herman {[}J. Chem. Phys. 103, 6371 (1995)], except for the vibrational
l-doubling constant R-45, for which an adjustment to the computed force
field is proposed.},

abstract = {Polyad quantum numbers have been assigned to 134 vibrational levels
of the X̃1Σ+g state of acetylene with internal energies from 3,000 to 15,000 cm−1.
These polyad assignments have been made possible by two advances: (1) the recording
of new, rigorously calibrated acetylene Ã1Au→X̃1Σ+g dispersed fluorescence spectra,
and (2) the development of a numerical pattern recognition technique which identifies
groups of transitions in the spectra that terminate on eigenstates with the same
polyad quantum numbers. This pattern recognition technique is based on the Extended
Cross-Correlation, which has been reported previously in this Journal [J. Chem.
Phys. 107, 8349, 8357 (1997)], and requires neither a priori knowledge of the
number of polyads in the spectra nor the pattern of spectral lines that is associated
with each polyad. No evidence for the breakdown of the polyad quantum numbers is
found, at the 7 cm−1 resolution of our spectra, at internal energies up to at
least 15,000 cm−1. The ability to assign polyad quantum numbers to spectral features
with up to 15,000 cm−1 of internal energy provides a panoramic perspective on the
trends in the short-time (∼1 ps) dynamics of acetylene at high internal energy.},

450 mbar to 4.9 × 102cm2s−1at 120 mbar. The vertical distribution of ammonia and
the eddy diffusion coefficient do not show a large variation with latitude. We
also determine an acetylene mixing ratio of (10–30) × 10−9near 80 mbar and an upper

   $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$, up to 12 000 cm$^{-1}$ {[}see M. Abbouti Temsamani and M.
   Herman, J. Chem. Phys. 102, 6371 (1995)]. Each of those clusters, which
   are called here V-clusters, is made of pure vibrational type diagonal
   and off-diagonal matrix elements. That model is extended to take care of
   the rotational structure, defining the V/l/C-cluster model. In a first
   step J-dependent terms are included in the diagonal elements of the
   V-clusters, and rotational l resonance off-diagonal matrix elements are
   included, leading to couple specific V-cluster matrices, resulting into
   so-called V/l-clusters. This extension is quantitatively demonstrated to
   reproduce the reported effective principal rotational constant and
   effective higher order distortion constants, for four selected clusters
   of levels: those containing V-1 + V-3, V-1 + V-2 + V-3. 3V(3) and V-2 +
   3V(3). In the case of the 3v(3) range, new FTIR spectra recorded around
   9700 cm$^{-1}$ are used. The related experimental conditions and new
   observed spectral features are briefly presented. A further extension of
   the model is then accomplished to include Coriolis-type interaction, by
   coupling V/l-clusters using a systematic mechanism. That step, defining
   the model of V/l/C-clusters, allows to suggest assignment for extra
   rovibrational lines observed around 3v(3) Those various steps are
   supported by a consistent picture involving constants of the motion,
   starting with three pseudoquantum numbers in the case of V-cluster,
   n(s),n(r),k, from which two, n(s),n(r) and then one n(r)
   remain when defining respectively the V/l-cluster and V/l/C-cluster

spectral intensity patterns, we have estimated the previously undetermined pure
bend vibrational constant, to be −11(2) cm-1. Unlike previously recorded DF spectra,
this DF spectrum is uniquely suited for comparison with an effective Hamiltonian
since (1) the Franck−Condon envelope facilitates observation of levels at lower
Evib in the X̃-state, (2) the improved resolution is sufficient to observe intramolecular
vibrational redistribution (IVR) at lower Evib, and (3) spectral features are no
longer absent because of nodal patterns in the Franck−Condon envelope. Our comparison
shows that our current effective Hamiltonian model, can qualitatively describe the
IVR pathways on the X̃-state for chromostates (zero-order bright states) which
contain high excitation in the trans-bend (v4 ≤ 12). The failure of our model for
chromostates which contain excitation in both the CC stretch (v2) and the trans-bend
(v4 > 8) may be attributed to a new stretch−bend or stretch-only resonance.

plausible rotational and vibrational assignments for previously unassigned transitions

Title = {{A refined quartic forcefield for acetylene - accurate calculation of
the vibrational-spectrum}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {157},
Pages = {301-336},
abstract = {It is now possible to calculate the nine-dimensional rovibrational
wavefunctions of sequentially bonded four-atom molecules variationally without
dynamical approximation. In the case of HCCH, the simplest such molecule, many
hundreds of rovibrational (J = 0, 1, 2) levels can be converged to better than 1.5
cm −1. Variational calculations of this kind are used here systematically to refine
the well-known quartic valence-coordinate forcefleld of Strey and Mills [J.Mol.
Spectrosc.59, 103-115 (1976)] against experimental term values up to three C-H
stretch quanta for the principal and two deuterated isotopomers, yielding a new
surface that reproduces the energies of all the known Σ, Π, and Δ states of these
species up to the energy of two C-H stretch quanta with an rms error of 3 cm−1.
The refined forcefield is used to study the resonances associated with the accidental
degeneracies (ν2 + ν4 + ν5, ν3) and (ν2 + 2ν5, ν1) in the principal isotopomer,
leading to a clarification of the assignment of she experimentally detected states
in the 2ν3 and 3ν3, polyads, and to the finding that vibrational Coriolis (kinetic
nergy) terms, rather than quartic anharmonicities in the potential, are the primary
cause of the resonant interactions. Using a new cubic ab initio electric dipole
field to calculate IR absorption coefficients, 24 undetected Σ and Π states of
1H12C12C1H and 5 undetected Σ states of D12C12CD are identified as candidates for
experimental study, and their calculated energies and assignments are given.},

the best prior study in the literature. The higher resolution allowed the assignment
of many more low-J Q-branch transitions. The range of optical densities available
in this study also allowed the extension of observed and assigned transitions to
significantly higher J-values than reported in prior studies. Availability of
improved standard lines resulted in high quality transition wavenumbers which
are accurate to approximately ±0.0001 cm−1. Using proven combination difference
techniques and analysis software, this study produces the best available molecular
parameters for the ν4 and ν5 states of acetylene. In addition, because acetylene
has no permanent dipole moment, this study extends the precision of available ground
state parameters B0 and D0 and produces for the first time an estimator of H0.
In addition to H0 values for both isotopic species treated, we have obtained for
the first time a value for H5 for the dominant isotopmer. The value of H5 for
the 13C12CH2 was not determined and thus thought to be significantly smaller than
H5 for 12C2H2. This study also obtains l-doubling parameters for both degenerate

Classical trajectory computations in the time domain (and their Fourier transform)

accord with the results of an analysis of the experimental stimulated emission
pumping. A separation of time scales suggested by the algebraic Hamiltonian is
verified in the classical simulations. There are four distinct, nested relaxation
stages following the initial state preparation, each corresponding to energy exchange
amongst a bigger subset of states. Initially (<1 ps) only the two CH stretch motions
are effectively coupled. It is suggested that the two CH quanta states (which
are primarily local mode in character) are responsible for the broad features in
the spectra at ≈26000 cm−1. Next the CH stretches and the (Franck-Condon) excited
CC stretch share energy. This stage is yet to be identified in the spectrum.
By ≈ 10 ps, the CH trans bend excitation is also fully coupled, resulting in
the “clumps” in the experimental spectrum. Finally, by about 15 ps there is
complete relaxation corresponding to a concerted orbiting motion of the H atoms
about the CC bond with a wide frequency band centered at ≈6 cm−1.},

x–K relations were imposed to yield the normal mode constants for ν1 and ν3.
Treatment of Darling–Dennison resonances in the first two overtone manifolds led
to reassignments of previously reported spectra and to the discovery of a Fermi
resonance involving overtones of ν3 and states containing ν1, ν2, and 2ν04. Calculated
rotational constants and intensity data confirm the assignments and interactions
treated in the vibrational analysis. Treatment of these resonances significantly
improved the agreement between calculated and observed transition wave numbers,
providing a coherent picture of acetylene C–H stretch dynamics below 10 000 cm−1.},

In the case of acetylene it has been verified that such vibrational changes and

without the anharmonic force field. The second derivative of the dipole moment
component parallel to the CC bond with respect to the CCH angle is determined as
(∂2μ‖∂α12)e = −2.123 ± 0.035 D for HCCH. The corresponding derivative in HCCCCH
is shown to be about 40\% larger than in HCCH. This fact may be ascribed to the
conjugation of the two CC triple bonds. The concept of the equivalent mode helps
us graphically understand the correlation between certain transition moments and
vibrational changes of the dipole moment.},

important because the second component can be calculated without the anharmonic

the zone of activity of the bright spot is found to be: latitude = 59 ± 10° and

be constant over a 3-day period. Two interpretations are proposed to explain these

thermal profile in the bright spot. Either may result from precipitation of charged

abstract = {We developed an ultrasensitive, computer-controlled, visible/near-IR,
cw laser photoacoustic spectrometer capable of detecting forbidden transitions
in order to understand the nature and states of highly vibrationally excited molecules.
We have obtained nearly Doppler-limited survey spectra of highly vibrationally
excited alkynes over a considerable energy range. Acetylene and substituted acetylenes
(HCCR) comprise a novel group of molecules because the highly localized CH chromophore
(CH oscillator) is linearly coupled via a strong CC triple bond to the rest of
the molecule. Thus, these HCCR alkynes are essentially one dimensional molecules
particularily amenable to studies involving intramolecular energy redistribution.
We first studied acetylene (H('12)C('12)Ch) and four isotopic modifications
(H('12)C('13)CH, H('13)C('13)CH, H('12)C('12)CD, D('12)C('12)CD) to understand
the global pattern (spectral positions, assignments, intensities, and perturbations)
of vibrational transitions in simple, model polyatomic molecules at high levels
of vibrational excitation and to develop comparison data for spectral analyses of
substituted acetylenes which exhibit intramolecular vibrational mixing and energy
redistribution. The second phase of our studies was to obtain detailed spectroscopic
information on the overtones of the following substituted acetylenes (HCCR):
cyanoacetylene (HCCCN), methylacetylene (HCCCH(,3)), 3,3,3-trideuteromethylacetylene
(HCCCD(,3)), 3,3,3-trifluoromethylacetylene (HCCCF(,3)), and tertiary butyl
acetylene (HCCC(CH(,3))(,3)). The substituent group "R" was varied from a simple
H atom to a tertiary butyl group to study not only the effect of increasing density
of states but to understand and distinguish the necessary and sufficient causes
of irreversible intramolecular energy redistribution in highly vibrationally excited
states of isolated polyatomic molecules as a function of increasing molecular

acetylenes in the region 14 900–18 500 cm−1. Peak positions of individual
rotation–vibration lines were determined to a precision of about 0.003 cm−1. A
total of 39 bands are analyzed: 16 for 12C2H2; 14 for 13C2H2; five for 12C13CH2;
and four for 12C2HD. The rotational structure of the bands is fit to a semirigid
rotor Hamiltonian. However, the bands suffer from severe rotational perturbations,
with typical matrix elements being on the order of 0.3 cm−1 or less. The error in
the determined band origins varies between 0.001 and 0.1 cm−1, depending on the
degree of perturbation. Precision rotational constants are also determined for
the observed bands. The vibrational term values cannot be adequately explained
in terms of the usual slightly anharmonic normal mode expansion. Even though acetylene
represents an intermediate case between the local mode and normal mode limits,
the simple local mode theory described by Child and Lawton [M. S. Child and R. T.
Lawton, Faraday Discuss. 71, 273 (1981)] can be used to rationalize many aspects
of the spectrum—e.g., the splitting of the states ‖005g011〉 and ‖005u011〉 is found
to be only 0.44 cm−1. The intermediate character of acetylene is seen upon single
deuterium substitution. The state corresponding to five quanta of 12C–H stretch
shifts about 100 cm−1 to the blue, a result which is certainly anomalous from the
point of view of intuitive local mode theory. The band origins for the observed
Σ–Σ transitions for all four acetylenes studied are found to be in good agreement
with the results of a recent variational calculation [L. Halonen, M.S. Child, and
S. Carter, Mol. Phys. 47, 1097 (1982)]. It is also observed that the anharmonic
shifts of the sequence band transitions are quite large—for the v=5 overtone band,
the sequence bands are shifted 74 cm−1 fo the Πg bend and 39 cm−1 for the Πu bend.},

an analysis was carried out based on the “diatomic potential.” Here each molecule
was assumed to consist of a pair of centers separated by an effective distance d,
each center interacting, through a Lennard‐Jones‐type potential, with the centers
in all neighboring molecules. Frequencies and thermal frequency shifts were calculated
as a function of d, and good agreement was attained with the observed values for

The product of this effective charge by the separation of the carbon and hydrogen
atoms is interpreted as giving an estimate of the C–H bond moment, the value obtained
being (1.05±0.01)×10−18 esu cm. For the active stretching vibration, the computed
effective charge was 0.515×10−10 esu, which is the rate of change of bond moment
with internuclear distance. A comparison of these results with previous work indicates
a possible regularity in the C–H bond moment in going from methane to ethylene
to acetylene, although the regularity may be only apparent.},

non-Local Thermodinamic Equilibrium (non-LTE) emissions of CH4, HCN and C2H2 in
the near-infrared represent a dataset with unique coverage to study Titan's upper
atmosphere in the altitude range from 500 to 1000 km. This region is the key to a
better understanding of the middle atmosphere circulation. The assessment of the
latitudinal and seasonal variations in the distributions of HCN and C2H2 could give
important hints about it and complement the Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS)
observations, that target the atmosphere below 500 km. The measurement of CH4 and
HCN above 900 km can also help in understanding the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer
(INMS) observations near and above 1000 km. We have analysed the VIMS daytime spectra
in the 2.9–3.4 μm region measured from 2004 to 2012 that span from the mid-northern
winter through mid-northern spring Titan seasons. The measurements exhibit very
strong non-LTE emissions of CH4, HCN and C2H2. Non-LTE vibrational temperatures
have been calculated for the emitting levels of the three molecules, and have been
used in the inversion of their abundances in the 500–1100 km region. The retrieved
abundances have been averaged in latitudinal bins and in two seasons: north hemisphere
winter (2004–2009) and north hemisphere early spring (2010−2012). The C2H2 average
profile, retrieved for the first time from VIMS measurements, shows good agreement
with UltraViolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) measurements below 850 km, while higher
values are found above that altitude. The HCN volume mixing ratio (VMR) shows an
enhancement at the north pole during winter at all altitudes (from ∼700 km up to
near 1000 km) and at the north and south poles during spring below 900 km. Also,
the average C2H2 abundance is larger at both poles during spring below 800 km, while
no significant variation is seen during winter. For CH4 we found enhancements
above 800 km at the north pole during winter and at both poles during spring. Our
results suggest that the middle atmosphere circulation on Titan extends well above
the 500 km level, up to 750–800 km or even higher if we assume that the CH4 concentration
above 800 km is mainly controlled by the circulation. The behavior of CH4 at the winter
pole above 800 km is in line with the strong zonal winds suggested to explain INMS
observations, although it can also be explained by the slower photo-dissociation
occurring during polar winter. Despite the poor statistic at the polar regions,
our results represent a unique dataset that could help to improve our understanding
of Titan's atmosphere above 500 km.},
