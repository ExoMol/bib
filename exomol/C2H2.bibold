  abstract = {A one-dimensional local bend model is used to describe the variation
	of electronic properties of acetylene in vibrational levels that
	embody large amplitude local motions on the S-0 potential energy
	surface. Calculations performed at the CCSD(T) and MR-AQCC levels
	of theory predict an approximately linear dependence of the dipole
	moment on the number of quanta in either the local bending or local
	stretching excitation. In the local mode limit, one quantum of stretching
	excitation in one CH bond leads to an increase of 0.025 D in the
	dipole moment, and one quantum of bending vibration in the CCH angle
	leads to an increase of 0.068 D. The use of a one-dimensional model
	for the local bend is justified by comparison to the well-established
	polyad model which reveals a decoupling of the large amplitude bending
	from other degrees of freedom in the range of N-bend = 14-22. We
	find that the same one-dimensional large amplitude bending motion
	emerges from two profoundly different representations, a one-dimensional
	cut through an ab initio, seven-dimensional Hamiltonian and the three-dimensional
	(l = 0) pure-bending experimentally parametrized spectroscopic Hamiltonian.},

   coupling in the global model and analysis of emission spectra of hot
   acetylene around 3 mu m. J Chem Phys 2009;131:114301]. The present
   investigation focuses on the relative emission line intensities which
   are observed to be affected. The strongest lines intensity may be
   considerably reduced for high column density acetylene samples, hence
   affecting the 3:1 ortho:para intensity ratio. A radiative model is
   developed to take into account the effects generated by the strong
   opacity of the acetylene samples including self-absorption and
   absorption of the radiation emitted by the hot environment. The model is
   used to extract the absolute concentration of the high temperature
   acetylene samples from the observed relative spectral intensities. The
   relevance of the procedure for infrared remote sensing in high
   temperature astrophysical environments, such as circumstellar envelopes
   of cool carbon rich evolved stars, is discussed.}}

Abstract = {The vector formalism is a general approach that can supply, in an
efficient way, the algebraic expressions representing the kinetic
Hamiltonian operator of any quantum system of N particles, expressed in
curvilinear coordinates. In this study the possibilities of an improved
version of this formalism, in the context of nuclear movements of
molecular systems, are analyzed by obtaining the expressions
corresponding to several polyatomic systems. The internal coordinates
used in the present work are defined by establishing distances between
mass centers of nuclei groups, and by using logical Boolean parameters.
Other authors' results for four-atomic molecular systems (formaldehyde,
acetylene, satellite, symmetric dissociation cases) have also been
obtained and completed. The algebraic expressions of the first three
systems have been obtained also with an extended unified model, which
makes it possible to treat more complicated cases such as poly-ethane or
poly-satellite fragments, or as rotating body fixed x-axis coordinate
systems. It has been shown that all the kinetic terms of this extended
model can be obtained from 21 irreducible expressions. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {98},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1378-1397},
Abstract = {A new efficient and fully symmetry-adapted finite-basis variational
method for calculating the rovibrational eigenstates (J
greater-than-or-equal-to 0) of any sequentially bonded four-atom
molecule is presented. The exact kinetic-energy operator T(VR) in
valence coordinates is used in a scheme of successive basis-set
contractions. The success of the method is demonstrated with new results
for the molecules HCCH, HOOH, and HCNO, respectively linear, nonlinear,
and quasilinear. The complexity Of T(VR) contributes little to the
computational cost, yielding a Hamiltonian matrix whose elements can all
be cheaply calculated from products of arbitrarily accurate
one-dimensional integrals; the dominant cost is that of matrix
diagonalization. Matrices of up to 6000 X 6000 are used to obtain
low-lying levels converged to small fractions of 1 cm-1, even for the
difficult case of HOOH. The generalization to J greater-than-or-equal-to
0 allows the calculation of PI states for HCCH and HCNO and effective
rotational constants for HCCH, all usefully converged. For the first
time nine-dimensional rovibrational wave functions for four-atom systems
are calculated without dynamical approximation and with basis sets well
completed in all degrees of freedom. For HCCH it is straightforward to
obtain hundreds of rovibrational (J=0,1,2) levels converged to better
than 1.5 cm-1, opening up the possibility of the systematic refinement
of the nuclear potential function V(N).},

the rovibrational spectrum of sequentially bonded four-atomic molecules,

Abstract = {Comets are rich in volatile materials, of which roughly 80\% (by number)
are mater molecules(1). Considerable progress(2-4) being made in
identifying the other volatile species, the abundances of which should
enable us to determine whether comets formed primarily from ice-covered
interstellar grains(5), or from material that was chemically processed
in the early solar nebula(6,7). Here we report the detection of
acetylene (C2H2,) in the infrared spectrum of comet C/1996 B2
(Hyakutake). The estimated abundance is 0.3-0.9\%, relative to water,
which is comparable to the predicted solid-phase abundance in cold
interstellar clouds. This suggests that the volatiles in comet Hyakotake
may have come from ice-covered interstellar grains, rather than material
processed in the accretion disk out of which the Solar System formed.},

Pages = {681-698},
Abstract = {The variational method has been used to determine the geometry and
ground state potential surface of acetylene. All the parameters were
refined through a least-squares fit to J = 0, 1 levels for C2H2 and
C2D2. A new program was written to evaluate the rovibrational energy
levels; in particular, primitive basis sets were developed for all
values of J taking into account the singularity for linear geometries.
Thus Sigma, Pi, Delta states can be refined. The full theory for
tetraatomic linear molecules is presented. In this refinement 150
observed levels were used as data, below 10 000 cm(1). The geometry was
refined and gives R-e(CC) = 1.2028 Angstrom, R-e(CH) = 1.0618 Angstrom,
to be compared with the best experimentally derived values of 1.2027 +/-
0.0005 Angstrom, 1.062 +/- 0.001 Angstrom, respectively. The zero point
energies are 5771.1 cm(1) for C2H2 and 4571.1 cm(1) for C2D2.},

Hamiltonian in orthogonal internal coordinates},
Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {122},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Two methods are developed, when solving the related time-independent
Schrodinger equation (TISE), to cope with the singular terms of the
vibrational kinetic energy operator of a triatomic molecule given in
orthogonal internal coordinates. The first method provides a
mathematically correct treatment of all singular terms. The vibrational
eigenfunctions are approximated by linear combinations of functions of a
three-dimensional nondirect-product basis, where basis functions are
formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions, where DVR stands for discrete
variable representation, depending on distance-type coordinates and
Legendre polynomials depending on angle bending. In the second method
one of the singular terms related to a distance-type coordinate, deemed
to be unimportant for spectroscopic applications, is given no special
treatment. Here the basis set is obtained by taking the direct product
of a one-dimensional DVR basis with a two-dimensional nondirect-product
basis, the latter formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions and Legendre
polynomials. With the basis functions defined, matrix representations of
the TISE are set up and solved numerically to obtain the vibrational
energy levels of H-3(+). The numerical calculations show that the first
method treating all singularities is computationally inefficient, while
the second method treating properly only the singularities having
physical importance is quite efficient. (C) 2005 American Institute of

Abstract = {A technique has been developed which in principle allows the
determination of the full rotational-vibrational eigenspectrum of
triatomic molecules by treating the important singularities present in
the triatomic rotational-vibrational kinetic energy operator given in
Jacobi coordinates and the R, embedding. The singular term related to
the diatom-type coordinate, R-1, deemed to be unimportant for
spectroscopic applications, is given no special attention. The work
extends a previous {[}J. Chem. Phys., 2005, 122, 024101] vibration-only
approach and employs a generalized finite basis representation (GFBR)
resulting in a nonsymmetric Hamiltonian matrix {[}J. Chem. Phys., 2006,
124, 014110]. The basis set to be used is obtained by taking the direct
product of a 1-D DVR basis, related to R1, with a 5-D nondirect-product
basis, the latter formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions depending on
the distance-type coordinate causing the singularity, associated
Legendre polynomials depending on the Jacobi angle, and rotational
functions depending on the three Euler angles. The robust implicitly
restarted Arnoldi method within the ARPACK package is used for the
determination of a number of eigenvalues of the nonsymmetric Hamiltonian
matrix. The suitability of the proposed approach is shown by the
determination of the rotational-vibrational energy levels of the ground
electronic state of H-3(+) somewhat above its barrier to linearity.
Convergence of the eigenenergies is checked by an alternative approach,
employing a Hamiltonian expressed in Radau coordinates, a standard
direct-product basis, and no treatment of the singularities.},

Abstract = {A general, full-dimensional computational method for the accurate
calculation of rotationally and vibrationally excited states of
tetra-atomic molecules is further developed. The resulting computer
program may be run in serial and parallel modes and is particularly
appropriate for molecules executing wide-amplitude motions and
isomerizations. An application to the isomerizing acetylene/vinylidene
system is presented. Large-scale calculations using a coordinate system
based on orthogonal satellite vectors have been performed in six
dimensions and vibrational term values and wave functions for acetylene
and vinylidene states up to approximate to 23000 cm(-1) above the
potential minimum have been determined. This has permitted the
characterization of acetylene and vinylidene states at and above the
isomerization barrier. These calculations employ more extensive
vibrational basis sets and hence consider a much higher density of
states than in any variational calculations reported hitherto for this
system. Comparison of the calculated density of states with that
determined empirically suggests that our calculations are the most
realistic achieved for this system to date. Indeed more states have been
converged than in any previous study of this system. Calculations on
lower lying excited states of acetylene based on HC - CH diatom-diatom
coordinates give nearly identical results to those based on orthogonal
satellite vectors. Comparisons are also made with calculations based on
HH - CC diatom-diatom coordinates. (C) 2005 American Institute of

Journal = {J. Chem. Phys.},

Volume = {108},

Pages = {676-691},
Abstract = {The quartic force field of acetylene was determined using the CCSD(T)
method (coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions and
quasiperturbative inclusion of connected triple excitations) with a
variety of one-particle basis sets of the atomic natural orbital,
correlation consistent, and augmented correlation consistent types. The
harmonic pi(g) bending frequency omega(4) and the corresponding
anharmonicity omega(4)-nu(4) are both found to be extremely sensitive to
the basis set used, in particular to the presence of a sufficient
complement of diffuse functions, (Due to symmetry cancellation, the
corresponding effect on the pi(u) mode, i.e., omega(5) and
omega(5)-nu(5), is much weaker.) Similar phenomena are observed more
generally in bending modes for molecules that possess carbon-carbon
multiple bonds. Tentative explanations are advanced, Our best computed
quartic force field, which combines CCSD(T)/{[}6s5p4d3f2g/4s3p2d1f]
anharmonicities with a geometry and harmonic frequencies that
additionally include inner-shell correlation effects, reproduces the
observed fundamentals for HCCH, HCCD, DCCD, (HCCH)-C-13, and
(HCCH)-C-13-C-13 with a mean absolute error of 1.3 cm(-1), and the
equilibrium rotational constant to four decimal places, without any
empirical adjustment. Anharmonicity and quartic resonance constants are
in excellent agreement with the recent determination of Temsamani and

perturbative expansions for the vibrational energies. Only when
coupling terms are introduced do differences between the calculated
energies in the two representations become apparent. In CO2, where
there is pronounced configuration interaction between nearly degenerate
states, we find that the perturbative energies obtained from the
curvilinear normal coordinate Hamiltonian are converging significantly
faster than those obtained in the rectilinear normal coordinate
representation.},

Abstract = {Acetylene occurs, by photolysis of methane, in the atmospheres of jovian
planets and Titan. In contrast, acetylene is only a trace component of
Earth's current atmosphere. Nonetheless, a methane-rich atmosphere has
been hypothesized for early Earth; this atmosphere would also have been
rich in acetylene. This poses a paradox, because acetylene is a potent
inhibitor of many key anaerobic microbial processes, including
methanogenesis, anaerobic methane oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and
hydrogen oxidation. Fermentation of acetylene was discovered similar to
25 years ago, and Pelobacter acetylenicus was shown to grow on acetylene
by virtue of acetylene hydratase, which results in the formation of
acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde subsequently dismutates to ethanol and
acetate ( plus some hydrogen). However, acetylene hydratase is specific
for acetylene and does not react with any analogous compounds. We
hypothesize that microbes with acetylene hydratase played a key role in
the evolution of Earth's early biosphere by exploiting an available
source of carbon from the atmosphere and in so doing formed protective
niches that allowed for other microbial processes to flourish.
Furthermore, the presence of acetylene in the atmosphere of a planet or
planetoid could possibly represent evidence for an extraterrestrial
anaerobic ecosystem.},

Abstract = {We report on the determination of a high quality ab initio potential
energy surface (PES) and dipole moment function for water. This PES is
empirically adjusted to improve the agreement between the computed line
positions and those from the HITRAN 92 data base with J less than or
equal to 5 for (H2O)-O-16. The changes in the PES are small, nonetheless
including an estimate of core (oxygen 1s) electron correlation greatly
improves the agreement with the experiment. Using this adjusted PES, we
can match 30 092 of the 30 117 transitions in the HITRAN 96 data base
for (H2O)-O-16 with theoretical lines. The 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90
percentiles of the difference between the calculated and tabulated line
positions are -0.11, -0.04, -0.01, 0.02, and 0.07 cm(-1). Nonadiabatic
effects are not explicitly included. About 3\% of the tabulated line
positions appear to be incorrect. Similar agreement using this adjusted
PES is obtained for the O-17 and O-18 isotopes. For (HDO)-O-16, the
agreement is not as good, with a root-mean-square error of 0.25 cm(-1)
for lines with J less than or equal to 5. This error is reduced to 0.02
cm(-1) by including a small asymmetric correction to the PES, which is
parameterized by simultaneously fitting to (HDO)-O-16 and (D2O)-O-16
data. Scaling this correction by mass factors yields good results for
T2O and HTO. The intensities summed over vibrational bands are usually
in good agreement between the calculations and the tabulated results,
but individual line strengths can differ greatly. A high-temperature
list consisting of 307 721 352 lines is generated for (H2O)-O-16 using

functions, the computation of a contracted rotational-bending basis,
followed by a final variational step coupling all degrees of freedom. An
angular basis is proposed whereby the rotational-bending contraction
takes place in three steps. Angular matrix elements of the potential are
evaluated by expansion in terms of a suitable basis, and the angular
integrals are given in a factorized form which simplifies their
evaluation. The basis functions in the final variational step have the
full permutation symmetries of the identical particles. Sample results
are given for HCCH and BH3.},

Abstract = {The ExoMol database (www.exomol.com) provides extensive line lists of
molecular transitions which are valid over extended temperature ranges.
The status of the current release of the database is reviewed and a new
data structure is specified. This structure augments the provision of
energy levels (and hence transition frequencies) and Einstein A
coefficients with other key properties, including lifetimes of
individual states, temperature-dependent cooling functions, Lande
g-factors, partition functions, cross sections, k coefficients and
transition dipoles with phase relations. Particular attention is paid to
the treatment of pressure broadening parameters. The new data structure
includes a definition file which provides the necessary information for
utilities accessing ExoMol through its application programming interface
(API). Prospects for the inclusion of new species into the database are
discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The discovery of extrasolar planets is one of the major scientific
advances of the last two decades. Hundreds of planets have now been
detected and astronomers are beginning to characterize their composition
and physical characteristics. To do this requires a huge quantity of
spectroscopic data most of which are not available from laboratory
studies. The ExoMol project will offer a comprehensive solution to this
problem by providing spectroscopic data on all the molecular transitions
of importance in the atmospheres of exoplanets. These data will be
widely applicable to other problems and will be used for studies on cool
stars, brown dwarfs and circumstellar environments. This paper lays out
the scientific foundations of this project and reviews previous work in
this area. A mixture of first principles and empirically tuned quantum
mechanical methods will be used to compute comprehensive and very large
rotationvibration and rotationvibrationelectronic line lists.
Methodologies will be developed for treating larger molecules such as
methane and nitric acid. ExoMol will rely on these developments and the
use of state-of-the-art computing.},

Journal = {Astrophys. J.},

Number = {2},
Abstract = {We report the analysis of two new spectroscopic observations in the
near-infrared of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e, obtained with the WFC3
camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope. 55 Cancri e orbits so close
to its parent star that temperatures much higher than 2000 K are
expected on its surface. Given the brightness of 55 Cancri, the
observations were obtained in scanning mode, adopting a very long
scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our specialized
pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these
observational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions
of the instrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel
with an average relative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and find
modulations that depart from a straight line model with a 6 sigma
confidence level. These results suggest that 55 Cancri e is surrounded
by an atmosphere, which is probably hydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian
spectral retrieval code, T-REx, has identified HCN to be the most likely
molecular candidate able to explain the features at 1.42 and 1.54 mu m.
While additional spectroscopic observations in a broader wavelength
range in the infrared will be needed to confirm the HCN detection, we
discuss here the implications of such a result. Our chemical model,
developed with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high
mixing ratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio. This result
suggests this super-Earth is a carbon-rich environment even more exotic
than previously thought.},

Volume = {79},
Number = {5},
Pages = {943-951},
Abstract = {The construction of the molecular vibration-rotation Hamiltonian is
considered, with particular reference to two alternative treatments of
molecules with linear reference configurations. These can be considered
to have either (i) 3N - 5 vibrational and 2 rotational degrees of
freedom or (ii) 3N - 6 vibrational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom.
In either case the classical kinetic energy consists of vibrational,
rotational and translational parts given by 2T = SIGMA(k) P(k)2 +
SIGMA(alphabeta) omega(alpha)I(alphabeta)'omega(beta) + 1/M P2.
The rotational part contains the angular velocity omega and the
modified moment of inertia tensor I' of Wilson and Howard, which also
occurs in the relation J(alpha) - pi(alpha) =
SIGMA(beta)I(alphabeta)omega(beta)' involving the total (J) and
vibrational (pi) angular momenta. In case (i), I' has a vanishing z row
and column, where z is the axis of the molecule. This is associated with
the Sayvetz condition that the total angular momentum about the axis is
purely vibrational. These equations therefore contain only the two
components omega(x) and omega(y) of omega, which can be eliminated to
give the Hamiltonian form of the kinetic energy. In case (ii), the z
row and column of the I' matrix are non-vanishing and I' is
non-singular. The three components of omega can therefore be obtained in
terms of the angular momenta, to give a treatment that is entirely
analogous to that for a nonlinear reference configuration. The
parameters of the case (ii) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of those
of case (i).},

Abstract = {We present a new numerical method to construct a rotational-vibrational
Hamiltonian of a general polyatomic molecule in the Eckart frame as a
power series expansion in terms of curvilinear internal coordinates. The
expansion of the kinetic energy operator of an arbitrary order is
obtained numerically using an automatic differentiation (AD) technique.
The method is applicable to molecules of arbitrary size and structure
and is flexible for choosing various types of internal coordinates. A
new way of solving the Eckart-frame equations for curvilinear
coordinates also based on the AD technique is presented. The resulting
accuracy of the high-order expansion coefficients for the kinetic energy
operator using our numerical technique is comparable to that obtained by
symbolic differentiation, with the advantage of being faster and less
demanding in memory. Examples for H2CO, NH3, PH3, and CH3Cl molecules
demonstrate the advantages of the curvilinear internal coordinates and
the Eckart molecular frame for accurate ro-vibrational calculations. Our
results show that very high accuracy and quick convergence can be
achieved even with moderate expansions if curvilinear coordinates are
employed, which is important for applications involving large polyatomic
molecules. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {We present a new computational method with associated computer program
TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies) to perform variational
calculations of rovibrational energies for general polyatomic molecules

nuclear kinetic energy operator is represented as an expansion in terms
of internal coordinates. The main feature of the computational scheme is
a numerical construction of the kinetic energy operator, which is an
integral part of the computation process. Thus the scheme is
self-contained, i.e., it requires no analytical pre-derivation of the
kinetic energy operator. It is also general, since it can be used in
connection with any internal coordinates. The method represents an
extension of our model for pyramidal XY3 molecules reported previously

   takes into account the centrifugal distortion, rotational and
   vibrational l-doubling terms and both anharmonic and Coriolis resonance
   interaction operators arising due to the approximate relations between
   the harmonic frequencies: omega(1) approximate to omega(3) approximate
   to 5 omega(4) approximate to 5 omega(5) and omega(2) approximate to 3
   omega(4) approximate to 3 omega(5). The dimensionless weighted standard
   deviation of the fit is 2.8. The fitted set of 237 effective Hamiltonian
   parameters allowed reproducing 24,991 measured line positions of 494

   The eigenfunctions of the effective Hamiltonian corresponding to the

   CARBON MONOXIDE AND WATER IN HOT, HYDROGEN-DOMINATED ATMOSPHERES},
Journal = {Astrophys. J.},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {817},
Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the abundance of carbon dioxide in
   exoplanetary atmospheres in hot, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We
   construct novel analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium
   that include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, methane and
   acetylene and relate the equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions
   to temperature and pressure via the tabulated Gibbs free energies. We
   prove that such chemical systems may be described by a quintic equation
   for the mixing ratio of methane. By examining the abundances of these
   molecules across a broad range of temperatures (spanning equilibrium
   temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via temperature-pressure
   profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and
   carbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant
   compared to carbon monoxide and water. Atmospheric mixing does not alter
   this conclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the
   atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable
   abundances if the metallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is
   negated by temperatures above 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated
   atmospheres, our generic result has the implication that retrieval
   studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon dioxide as a prior of
   the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam free as a
   fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions. We
   discuss the relevance of these implications for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b
   and suggest that some of the previous results are chemically impossible.
   The relative abundance of carbon dioxide to acetylene is potentially a
   sensitive diagnostic of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio.},

   AND ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR ARBITRARY C/O},
Journal = {Astrophys. J.},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {816},
Abstract = {We present a self-consistent formalism for computing and understanding
   the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets from the viewpoint of an
   astrophysicist. Starting from the first law of thermodynamics, we
   demonstrate that the van't Hoff equation (which describes the
   equilibrium constant), Arrhenius equation (which describes the rate
   coefficients), and procedures associated with the Gibbs free energy
   (minimization, rescaling) have a common physical and mathematical
   origin. We address an ambiguity associated with the equilibrium
   constant, which is used to relate the forward and reverse rate
   coefficients, and restate its two definitions. By necessity, one of the
   equilibrium constants must be dimensionless and equate to an exponential
   function involving the Gibbs free energy, while the other is a ratio of
   rate coefficients and must therefore possess physical units. We
   demonstrate that the Arrhenius equation takes on a functional form that
   is more general than previously stated without recourse to tagging on ad
   hoc functional forms. Finally, we derive analytical models of chemical
   systems, in equilibrium, with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. We include
   acetylene and are able to reproduce several key trends, versus
   temperature and carbon-to-oxygen ratio, published in the literature. The
   rich variety of behavior that mixing ratios exhibit as a function of the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio is merely the outcome of stoichiometric
   book-keeping and not the direct consequence of temperature or pressure
   variations.},

Abstract = {We use solar occultations observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping
   Spectrometer on board the Cassini Spacecraft to extract the 1-5 mu m
   transmission spectrum of Saturn, as if it were a transiting exoplanet.
   We detect absorption from methane, ethane, acetylene, aliphatic
   hydrocarbons, and possibly carbon monoxide, with peak-to-peak features
   of up to 90 parts-per-million despite the presence of ammonia clouds. We
   also find that atmospheric refraction, as opposed to clouds or haze,
   determines the minimum altitude that could be probed during mid-transit.
   Self-consistent exoplanet atmosphere models show good agreement with
   Saturn's transmission spectrum but fail to reproduce a large absorption
   feature near 3.4 mu m, likely caused by gaseous ethane and a C-H
   stretching mode of an unknown aliphatic hydrocarbon. This large feature
   is located in one of the Spitzer Space Telescope bandpasses and could
   alter interpretations of transmission spectra if not properly modeled.
   The large signal in Saturn's transmission spectrum suggests that
   transmission spectroscopy of cold, long-period gaseous exoplanets should
   be possible with current and future observatories. Motivated by these
   results, we briefly consider the feasibility of. using a survey to
   search for and characterize cold exoplanets that are analogous to
   Jupiter and Saturn utilizing a target-of-opportunity approach.},

   two carbon atoms). To correctly study these C-rich atmospheres, a
   chemical scheme adapted to this composition is necessary.
   Aims. We have implemented a chemical scheme that can describe the
   kinetics of species with up to six carbon atoms (C-0-C-6 scheme). This
   chemical scheme has been developed with combustion specialists and
   validated by experiments that were conducted on a wide range of
   temperatures (300-2500 K) and pressures (0.01-100 bar).
   Methods. To determine for which type of studies this enhanced chemical
   scheme is mandatory, we created a grid of 12 models to explore different
   thermal profiles and C/O ratios. For each of them, we compared the
   chemical composition determined with a C-0-C-2 chemical scheme (species
   with up to two carbon atoms) and with the C-0-C-6 scheme. We also
   computed synthetic spectra corresponding to these 12 models.
   Results. We found no difference in the results obtained with the two
   schemes when photolyses were excluded from the model, regardless of the
   temperature of the atmosphere. In contrast, differences can appear in
   the upper atmosphere (P >similar to 1-10 mbar) when there is
   photochemistry. These differences are found for all the tested
   pressure-temperature profiles if the C/O ratio is above 1. When the C/O
   ratio of the atmosphere is solar, differences are only found at
   temperatures lower than 1000 K. The differences linked to the use of
   different chemical schemes have no strong influence on the synthetic
   spectra. However, with this study, we have confirmed C2H2 and HCN as
   possible tracers of warm C-rich atmospheres.
   Conclusions. The use of this new chemical scheme (instead of the
   C-0-C-2) is mandatory for modelling atmospheres with a high C/O ratio
   and, in particular, for studying the photochemistry in detail. If the
   focus is on the synthetic spectra, a smaller scheme may be sufficient,
   because it will be faster in terms of computation time.},

Abstract = {We have carried out an investigation of the chemical evolution of gas in
   different carbon-rich circumstellar environments. Previous studies have
   tended to invoke terrestrial flame chemistries, based on acetylene
   (C2H2) combustion to model the formation of carbon dust, via polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this work, we pay careful attention to
   the accurate calculation of the molecular photoreaction rate
   coefficients to ascertain whether there is a universal formation
   mechanism for carbon dust in strongly irradiated astrophysical
   environments. A large number of possible chemical channels may exist for
   the formation of PAHs, so we have concentrated on the viability of the
   formation of the smallest building block species, C2H2, in a variety of
   carbon-rich stellar outflows. C2H2 is very sensitive to dissociation by
   UV radiation. This sensitivity is tested, using models of the
   time-dependent chemistry. We find that C2H2 formation is sensitive to
   some of the physical parameters and that in some known sources of dust
   formation it can never attain appreciable abundances. Therefore,
   multiple (and currently ill-defined) dust-formation channels must exist.},

Abstract = {Some super Earths and mini Neptunes will likely have thick atmospheres
   that are not H-2-dominated. We have developed a
   photochemistry-thermochemistry kinetic-transport model for exploring the
   compositions of thick atmospheres on super Earths and mini Neptunes,
   applicable for both H-2-dominated atmospheres and non-H-2-dominated
   atmospheres. Using this model to study thick atmospheres for wide ranges
   of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into
   hydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich
   atmospheres, and hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find that carbon has
   to be in the form of CO2 rather than CH4 or CO in a H-2-depleted
   water-dominated thick atmosphere and that the preferred loss of light
   elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich atmosphere leads to the
   formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We apply our
   self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnostic
   features for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ 1214 b, HD97658 b,
   and 55 Cnc e. For GJ 1214 b, we find that (1) C2H2 features at 1.0 and
   1.5 mu m in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 mu m in
   thermal emission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a
   detection of water-vapor features and a confirmation of the nonexistence
   of methane features would provide sufficient evidence for a
   water-dominated atmosphere. In general, our simulations show that
   chemical stability has to be taken into account when interpreting the
   spectrum of a super Earth/mini Neptune. Water-dominated atmospheres only
   exist for carbon to oxygen ratios much lower than the solar ratio,
   suggesting that this kind of atmospheres could be rare.},

   several hydrocarbon molecules and cyanopolyyne molecules can be present.
   An increase in surface gravity and/or a decrease in metallicity support
   the increase in the partial pressures of these species. CO, CO2, CH4 and
   HCN contain the largest fraction of carbon. In the upper atmosphere of

Journal = {Astrophys. J.},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {763},
Abstract = {Motivated by recent spectroscopic evidence for carbon-rich atmospheres
   on some transiting exoplanets, we investigate the influence of the C/O
   ratio on the chemistry, composition, and spectra of extrasolar giant
   planets both from a thermochemical equilibrium perspective and from
   consideration of disequilibrium processes like photochemistry and
   transport-induced quenching. We find that although CO is predicted to be
   a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters for all C/O ratios,
   other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much more abundant
   when C/O < 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly in abundance
   when C/O > 1. Other notable species like N-2 and NH3 that do not contain
   carbon or oxygen are relatively unaffected by the C/O ratio.
   Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance of CH4, NH3, HCN,
   and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare the results of our
   models with secondary-eclipse photometric data from the Spitzer Space
   Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium models with C/O similar
   to 1 are consistent with spectra of WASP-12b, XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b,
   confirming the possible carbon-rich nature of these planets; (2) spectra
   from HD 189733b are consistent with C/O less than or similar to 1, but
   as the assumed metallicity is increased above solar, the required C/O
   ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent too much H2O absorption; (3)
   species like HCN can have a significant influence on spectral behavior
   in the 3.6 and 8.0 mu m Spitzer channels, potentially providing even
   more opacity than CH4 when C/O > 1; and (4) the very high CO2 abundance
   inferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared observations cannot be
   explained through equilibrium or disequilibrium chemistry in a
   hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. We discuss possible formation mechanisms
   for carbon-rich hot Jupiters, including scenarios in which the accretion
   of CO-rich, H2O-poor gas dominates the atmospheric envelope, and
   scenarios in which the planets accrete carbon-rich solids while
   migrating through disk regions inward of the snow line. The C/O ratio
   and bulk atmospheric metallicity provide important clues regarding the
   formation and evolution of the giant planets.},

Abstract = {We consider six possible sources of CH4 and other lowmass (C-2-C-5)
   organics in the plume of Enceladus: three of these sources represent
   initial endowments of organics: cometary organics, Titan-like tholin,
   and the Fisher-Tropsch type reactions in the gases from which Enceladus
   formed. The other three sources represent processes inside Enceladus:
   water-rock reactions, microbiology, and thermogenesis. We report on new
   laboratory results for C-2 hydrocarbons released by thermogenesis of
   laboratory tholin and the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis. Thermal
   processing of Titan-like tholin produced ratios of CH4/C2H4 and CH4/C2H6
   of about two for temperatures up to 450 degrees C and about six for a
   temperature of 650 degrees C. The low pressure (similar to 1 atm)
   Fisher-Tropsch type experiments produced CH4/C2H4 of similar to 1.5,
   similar to previous results. C2H2 was not produced by either process.
   Tests of gas production by four strains of methanogens confirmed the
   absence of any detectable production of non-methane hydrocarbons.
   Cometary endowment, the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis, and Titan-like
   tholin incorporation could be primary inputs of organics and subsequent
   thermal processing of any of these all are possible sources of low mass
   organics in the plume. Biological production and water-rock reactions
   are an alternative source of CH4. Aqueous reactions with CO and H-2 can
   produce C-2-C-5 organics even at the low pressures of the interior of
   Enceladus. If there is a confirmed detection of CO and C2H2 in the plume
   of Enceladus, this provides an important constraint on sources, as we
   have identified no process, other than the initial volatile component of
   cometary organics, which can supply these gases. Precise determination
   of the relative concentrations of C-1-C-5 hydrocarbons may provide
   additional constraints on sources, but a detailed isotopic analysis of C

   1 mu bar, where CO, H2O, and N-2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2

   previously unreported sub-states, or extend assignments in 35 already

   assigned, was performed, accessing vibrational states up to 8900 cm(-1).
   Coriolis interactions were systematically introduced in the global
   Hamiltonian, which also accounted for higher order vibrational constants
   and considered the role of higher excited bending states than before.
   The dimensionless standard deviation of the fit was 1.07 and 396

   (CH3C2H); HCN on the other hand is at best marginally present. We derive
   column densities and temperatures by modelling the molecular absorption.
   While the relative abundances of the polyacetylenes are consistent with
   chemical models for the outer envelopes of evolved carbon stars, those
   for HC3N and HCN are not. It is not clear whether the presence of
   benzene indicates an efficient means of formation, or instead a

Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope

   Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) and two foreground
   Galactic carbon stars. The band strengths of the observed C(2)H(2) and
   SiC features are very similar to those observed in Galactic AGB stars.
   The metallicities are estimated from an empirical relation between the
   acetylene optical depth and the strength of the SiC feature. The
   metallicities are higher than those of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and
   close to Galactic values. While the high metallicity could imply an age
   of around 1 Gyr, for the dusty AGB stars, the pulsation periods suggest
   ages in excess of 2 or 3 Gyr. We fit the spectra of the observed stars
   using the DUSTY radiative transfer model and determine their dust
   mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0-3.3 x 10(-8) M(circle dot)
   yr(-1). The two Galactic foreground carbon-rich AGB stars are located at

Abstract = {The absorption spectrum of 12C2H2 has been recorded using cavity
   ringdown spectroscopy and analyzed in the ranges 6000 - 6356 cm-1 and
   6667-7015 cm-1. Fourteen new bands have been identified and additional
   J-lines were assigned in 10 already known bands. These new data,
   together with the published vibration-rotation absorption lines of
   12C2H2 accessing vibrational states up to 8600 cm-1 have been gathered
   in a database. The resulting set includes 12137 transitions involving
   186 different k = l4 + l5 sub-states, with li the angular momentum
   quantum number associated to the i degenerate bending vibration. These
   lines have been fitted simultaneously to spectroscopic parameters
   through J-dependent Hamiltonian matrices exploiting the vibrational
   polyad or cluster block-diagonalization, in terms of the pseudo-quantum
   numbers Nr = 5v1 + 3v2 + 5v3+v4+v5 and Ns = v1 + v2 + v3, also
   accounting for k and e/f parities and u/g symmetry. Modes 1 and 2
   correspond to the symmetric CH and CC stretchings, mode 3 to the
   antisymmetric CH stretch, and modes 4 and 5 to the trans- and
   cis-degenerate bendings, respectively. The fit was successfully
   achieved, with a dimensionless standard deviation of 0.92, leading to
   the determination of 266 effective vibration-rotation parameters.},

   these authors, showing that the accuracy of both results is likely
   better than 1\% for the strong bands. However, the spectrum becomes very
   crowded when one wants to study weaker bands, so that the average

Abstract = {We investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich asymptotic giant
   branch (AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the
   Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
   over the 5-38 mu m range. All 26 low-resolution spectra show acetylene
   (C2H2) bands at 7 and 14 mu m. The hydrogen cyanide (HCN) bands at these
   wavelengths are very weak or absent. This is consistent with low
   nitrogen abundances in the LMC. The observed 14 mu m C2H2 band is
   reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 K. There is no
   clear dilution of the 14 mu m C2H2 band by circumstellar dust emission.
   This 14-mu m band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar
   envelope in these high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous
   findings for Galactic stars. The C2H2 column density, derived from the
   13.7 mu m band, shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3 x 10(-6) to 5
   x 10(-5) M-circle dot yr(-1). This is comparable with the total
   mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from the spectral energy
   distribution. Additionally, we compare the line strengths of the 13.7 mu
   m C2H2 band of our LMC sample with those of a Galactic sample. Despite
   the low metallicity of the LMC, there is no clear difference in the C2H2
   abundance among LMC and Galactic stars. This reflects the effect of the
   third dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to
   high carbon-to-oxygen ratio at low metallicity.},

Abstract = {Methane and other larger hydrocarbons have been proposed as possible
   greenhouse gases on early Mars. In this work we explore if volcanic
   processes may have been a source for such molecules based on theoretical
   and experimental considerations. Geologic evidence and numerical
   simulations indicate that explosive volcanism was widely distributed
   throughout Mars. Volcanic lightning is typically produced in such
   explosive volcanism. Therefore this geologic setting was studied to
   determine if lightning could be a source for hydrocarbons in volcanic
   plumes. Volcanic lightning was simulated by focusing a high-energy
   infrared laser beam inside of a Pyrex reactor that contained the
   proposed volcanic gas mixture composed of 64\% CH4, 24\% H-2, 10\% H2O
   and 2\% N-2, according to an accretion model and the nitrogen content
   measured in Martian meteorites. The analysis of products was performed
   by gas chromatography coupled to infrared and mass spectroscopy. Eleven
   hydrocarbons were identified among the products, of which acetylene
   (C2H2) was the most abundant. A thermochemical model was used to
   determine which hydrocarbons could arise only from volcanic heat. In
   this case, acetylene and ethylene are formed at magmatic temperatures.
   Our results indicate that explosive volcanism may have injected into the
   atmosphere of early Mars similar to 6 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of acetylene,
   and similar to 2 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of 1,3-butadiyne, both produced by
   volcanic lightning, similar to 5 x 10(11) g yr(-1) of ethylene produced
   by volcanic heat, and 10(13) g yr(-1) of methane.},

   of acetylene is found to be high even at low metallicity. The high C2H2
   abundance can be explained with a high carbon- to- oxygen ( C/ O) ratio
   for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast, the HCN equivalent
   width is low: fewer than half of the extra- galactic carbon stars show
   the 3.5 mu m HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN equivalent
   width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon elemental
   abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
   mass, and stars with high luminosity ( i. e. high initial mass) could
   have a high HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-
   galactic and Galactic carbon stars. One SMC post- AGB star, SMC- S2,
   shows the 3.3 mu m PAH band. This first detection of a PAH band from an
   SMC post- AGB star confirms PAHs can form in these low- metallicity
   stars. None of the oxygen- rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
   possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the
   equivalent widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30
   angstrom for LMC metallicity. Several possible explanations are
   discussed, mostly based on the effect of pulsation and circumstellar
   dust. The observations imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach
   mass- loss rates as high as their Galactic counterparts, because there
   are more carbon atoms available and more carbonaceous dust can be
   formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO suggests less dust and lower
   mass- loss rates in low- metallicity oxygen- rich stars. The effect on
   the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.},

Abstract = {Two methods of evaluating matrix elements of a function in a polynomial

   the numerical method, where the integration is performed directly using
   numerical quadrature. A reduced grid is proposed for the latter which
   makes use of the symmetry of the basis. Comparison of the two methods is
   presented in the context of evaluation of matrix elements in a
   non-direct product basis. If high accuracy of all matrix elements is
   required then the expansion method is the best choice. If however the
   accuracy of high order matrix elements is not important (as in
   variational ro-vibrational calculations where one is typically
   interested only in the lowest eigenstates), then the method based on the
   reduced grid offers sufficient accuracy and is much quicker than the
   expansion method.},

   between the R and P branches of that latter band to a Coriolis
   interaction with l = 1 levels. We did not observe the v(4) +

Abstract = {The strong interactions of shock waves caused by stellar pulsation, the
   formation of molecules and dust grains and a variable radiation field
   present a considerable challenge when modelling the atmospheres and
   circumstellar envelopes of pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars. In
   this paper we present dynamic model atmospheres of long-period variables
   which allow a consistent computation of near-infrared molecular features
   and their variability with phase. We discuss the effects of grey
   radiative transfer, of molecular opacities and of shock waves on the
   atmospheric structures and on the resulting wind properties. We find
   that the gas absorption coefficient used in the dynamical calculation
   has a considerable influence on the structure of the atmosphere, the
   mass loss and the observable spectral features. Therefore, we stress the
   importance of using reasonable mean gas opacities in grey dynamic
   models. Most topics discussed in this paper concern both C- and O-rich
   atmospheres but the quantitative results are mainly based on C-rich
   models. Synthetic spectra resulting from selected C- and O-rich models
   have been presented and compared to observations in several recent
   papers. A systematic investigation of observable properties of our
   C-rich models will be the subject of a second paper in this series.},

   pulsed stimulated Raman process. After a delay of several nanoseconds, a
   high resolution spectrum corresponding to transitions from this long

   spectroscopy scheme. The use of a pulsed dye laser for providing one of
   the pumping radiations overcomes some of the limitations of the

   Herman, J. Chem. Phys. 102, 6371 (1995)]. Each of those clusters, which
   are called here V-clusters, is made of pure vibrational type diagonal
   and off-diagonal matrix elements. That model is extended to take care of
   the rotational structure, defining the V/l/C-cluster model. In a first
   step J-dependent terms are included in the diagonal elements of the
   V-clusters, and rotational l resonance off-diagonal matrix elements are
   included, leading to couple specific V-cluster matrices, resulting into
   so-called V/l-clusters. This extension is quantitatively demonstrated to
   reproduce the reported effective principal rotational constant and
   effective higher order distortion constants, for four selected clusters
   of levels: those containing V-1 + V-3, V-1 + V-2 + V-3. 3V(3) and V-2 +

   the model of V/l/C-clusters, allows to suggest assignment for extra
   rovibrational lines observed around 3v(3) Those various steps are
   supported by a consistent picture involving constants of the motion,
   starting with three pseudoquantum numbers in the case of V-cluster,
   n(s),n(r),k, from which two, n(s),n(r) and then one n(r)

Abstract = {We have recorded the Fourier transform absorption spectrum of acetylene,
   C2H2, at high resolution, around 6500 cm(-1). The positions of the
   strongest rovibrational lines are measured with respect to the
   rovibrational lines in 3-0 of CO. They provide secondary calibration
   standards in that range with an accuracy of 3 x 10(-4) cm(-1). The
   rotational analysis of the data gives evidence of five vibrational
   levels of Sigma(u)(+) symmetry, in addition to the bright combination
   level (1010(0)0(0)). This is demonstrated to strictly fit the predicted
   anharmonic resonance pattern in that region, which permits the
   vibrational assignment of those extra transitions. Study of the relative
   intensities of the reported vibrational transitions suggests the need to
   include new quartic anharmonic couplings. This is supported by the
   rovibrational analysis of the cold bands around 8500 cm(-1), involving
   the (1110(0)0(0)) bright level, which is also presented.},

abstract = {Absorption spectra of C2H2 have been recorded between 50 and 1450 cm1, with a resolution always better than 0.005 cm1, using two different Fourier transform spectrometers. Analysis of the data provided two sets of results. First, the bending levels with t Vt(t = 4, 5)  2 were characterized by a coherent set of 34 parameters derived from the simultaneous analysis of 15 bands, performed using a matrix Hamiltonian. The following main parameters were obtained (in cm1): 40 = 608.985196(14), 50 = 729.157564(10); B0 = 1.17664632(18), 4 = 1.353535(86)  103, 5 = 2.232075(40)  103; q40 = 5.24858(12)  103, and q50 = 4.66044(12)  103, with the errors (1) on the last quoted digit. Second, a more complete set of bending levels with t Vt  4, some of which have never previously been reported, and also including V2 = 1 have been fitted to 80 parameters. This simultaneous fit involved 43 bands and used the same full Hamiltonian matrix. Some perturbations which affect the higher excited levels are discussed.},

Abstract = {The absorption spectrum of acetylene has been recorded at room
   temperature (297 K) using high-sensitivity cavity ring-down spectroscopy
   (alpha(min) similar to 5x10(-11) cm(-1)) in the 5851 and 6341 cm-1
   interval corresponding to a region of very weak absorption. A list of
   about 10,700 absorption features with estimated absolute line
   intensities was constructed. The smallest intensities are of the order
   of 5x10(-29) cm molecule(-1). The line list includes about 2500
   absorption lines of ethylene present at the ppm level in the acetylene
   sample and identified on the basis of a high-resolution Fourier
   transform spectrum specifically recorded. A total of more than 2700
   lines of (C2H2)-C-12 were rovibrationally assigned in comparison with
   accurate predictions provided by a global effective operator model.
   Overall, the present effort adds about 2260 new assignments to the set
   of about 500 assigned transitions available in the literature. The new
   assignments correspond to 45 new bands and 17 already-known bands, for
   which additional J lines were assigned. Spectroscopic parameters were
   derived for the upper vibrational levels from a band by band fit of the
   line positions (typical root mean square deviation values are of the
   order of 0.001 cm(-1)). A few of the analysed bands were found to be
   affected by rovibrational perturbations, which are discussed. The new
   data will be valuable to refine the parameters of the global effective
   Hamiltonian and dipole moments of (C2H2)-C-12.},

The measured lines belong to 11 bands including three bands observed for the first time. The obtained intensity dataset constitutes the first intensity information in the region. The Herman-Wallis coefficients are derived from a fit of the measured intensity values. The reported results will be valuable to complete the spectroscopic databases of acetylene.}

Mol. Spectrosc. 116, 320333 (1986)]. In the case of acetylene it has been verified that such vibrational changes and transition moments are well approximated by the terms which may be calculated without the anharmonic force field. The second derivative of the dipole moment component parallel to the CC bond with respect to the CCH angle is determined as (212)e = 2.123  0.035 D for HCCH. The corresponding derivative in HCCCCH is shown to be about 40% larger than in HCCH. This fact may be ascribed to the conjugation of the two CC triple bonds. The concept of the equivalent mode helps us graphically understand the correlation between certain transition moments and vibrational changes of the dipole moment.}

Parity and diatomdiatom permutation symmetry are exploited. The final Hamiltonian matrix is sparse, and an iterative technique combined with an efficient preconditioner is employed to calculate the eigenvalues within desired spectral windows.

Such dipole moment changes and transition moments consist of two components, one depending on the first dipole moment derivatives with respect to bond lengths and the other depending on the second dipole moment derivatives with respect to bond angles. We show that the first component normally contributes little, and propose an approximation in which only the second component is retained. This approximation is practically important because the second component can be calculated without the anharmonic force constants. We derive formulas for the dipole moment changes and transition moments to facilitate a simultaneous analysis of different isotopic species. We introduce the concept of the equivalent mode, by which we may readily understand the correlation between the dipole moment change for a bending mode and the transition moment for a vibrational band. }

It is shown that the momentum distributions of fragment ions produced from CS210+ are well reproduced by a classical explosion model incorporating the coordinate and momentum distributions of the initial ground vibrational state of CS2. On the other hand, a significant deviation is observed for CS23+ due to the non-Coulombic character of the potential energy surfaces. Coulomb explosion imaging is applied to real-time probing of Coulomb exploding CS2 in highly charged states, using a pair of intense few-cycle laser pulses. It is shown that the explosion proceeds in a different time scale depending on the charge state, mostly along the linear geometry during the bond-breaking of the two CS bonds.}

    mass-losing carbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the Large Magellanic
    Cloud (LMC). The stars represent the superwind phase on the asymptotic giant
    branch (AGB), which forms a major source of dust for the interstellar medium
    (ISM) in galaxies. Bolometric magnitudes indicate progenitor masses of 1.5-2.5Msolar.
    The spectra cover the wavelength range 5-38mum. They show varying combinations
    of dust continuum, dust emission features (SiC, MgS) and molecular absorption
    bands (C2H2, HCN). A 10-mum absorption feature is attributed to C3. A weak band
    at 5.8mum is suggestive of carbonyl. The circumstellar 7.5-mum C2H2 band is found
    to be stronger at lower metallicity, explained by higher C/O ratios at low
    metallicity. The J - K versus K - A colours, used to select the sample, are
    shown to be relatively insensitive in separating carbon versus oxygen-rich
    AGB stars. The predominance of carbon stars therefore indicates that in the
    range 1.5-2.5Msolar, LMC AGB stars become carbon-rich before onset of the superwind.
    A set of four narrow bands, dubbed the Manchester system, is used to define
    the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. We investigate the strength
    and central wavelength of the SiC and MgS dust bands as a function of colour
    and metallicity. The line-to-continuum ratio of these bands shows some
    indication of being lower at low metallicity. The MgS band is only seen at
    dust temperatures below 600K. Metal-poor carbon stars can form amorphous
    carbon dust from self-produced carbon. The formation efficiency of oxygen-rich
    dust depends more strongly on metallicity. In lower-metallicity environments,
    the dust input into the ISM by AGB stars may be strongly biased towards
    carbonaceous dust. },

On the basis of these works, in the present contribution, we construct an empirical database for acetylene in the 5850  9415 cm1 region excluding the 63417000 cm1 interval corresponding to the very strong 1+3 manifold. Our database gathers and extends information included in our CRDS and FTS studies. In particular, the intensities of about 1700 lines measured by CRDS in the 72447920 cm1 are reported for the first time together with those of several bands of 12C13CH2 present in natural isotopic abundance in the acetylene sample. The Herman-Wallis coefficients of most of the bands are derived from a fit of the measured intensity values. A recommended line list is provided with positions calculated using empirical spectroscopic parameters of the lower and upper energy vibrational levels and intensities calculated using the derived Herman-Wallis coefficients. This approach allows completing the experimental list by adding missing lines and improving poorly determined positions and intensities. As a result the constructed line list includes a total of 10973 lines belonging to 146 bands of 12C2H2 and 29 bands of 12C13CH2. For comparison the HITRAN database in the same region includes 869 lines of 14 bands, all belonging to 12C2H2. Our weakest lines have an intensity on the order of 1029 cm/molecule, about three orders of magnitude smaller than the HITRAN intensity cut off. Line profile parameters are added to the line list which is provided in HITRAN format. The comparison of our acetylene database to the HITRAN line list or to results obtained using the global effective operator approach is discussed in terms of completeness and accuracy. }

It is based on the results of the global modeling of the line positions and intensities performed in Tomsk within the framework of the method of effective operators. To validate the Tomsk calculations new measurements of both line positions and intensities were performed using acetylene spectra recorded between 25 and 680 cm1 with the AILES-A beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron. Line positions and intensities of 627 transitions belonging to 9 bands have been measured for the first time in this region. Using the results of these new measurements and the published results of the measurements in the 13  248 cm1 and 390  634 cm1 regions performed with the same facilities new fittings of the line intensities for the P = 0 and P = 1 series of transitions have been performed. Here P = 5v1 + 3v2 + 5v3 + v4 + v5 is a polyad number, where v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5 are the principal quantum numbers of the acetylene harmonic oscillators. These new sets of the effective dipole moment parameters were used to generate the line list which contains the line positions and intensities of 39 and 29 bands, respectively for the P = 0 and P = 1 series of transitions. None of these bands is present in the HITRAN 2012 and GEISA 2015 databases. This paper presents the first part of a global work on the validation of Tomsk calculations.}

  abstract={We report on the detection with the Infrared Space Observatory ( ISO ), for the first time in the circumstellar medium, of the polyacetylenic chains C 4 H 2 and C 6 H 2 and of benzene (C 6 H 6 ) in the direction of the proto-planetary nebula CRL 618. Surprisingly, the abundances of di- and triacetylene are only a factor of 2-4 lower than that of C 2 H 2 . Benzene is [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 40 times less abundant than acetylene. We suggest that the chemistry in CRL 618 has been strongly modified by the UV photons coming from the hot central star and by the shocks associated with its high-velocity winds. All the infrared bands arise from a region with kinetic temperatures between 200 and 250 K, probably the photodissociation region associated with the dense torus that surrounds the central star. C 4 H 2 and C 6 H 2 have also been detected in CRL 2688, so it seems that C-rich proto-planetary nebulae are the best organic chemistry factories in space.}

I identify three problems one confronts (1) reducing the size of the basis; (2) computing hundreds of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large matrix; (3) calculating matrix elements of the potential, and present ideas that mitigate them. Most modern methods use a combination of these ideas. I divide popular methods into groups based on the strategies used to deal with the three problems. }

abstract = {A symmetry-adapted filter-diagonalization method is used to calculate the vibrational spectrum of planar acetylene. In this method, vibrational eigenvalues in a given symmetry are obtained by solving a generalized eigenproblem in which the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices are assembled from symmetry-adapted correlation functions. Since no filtered state is explicitly needed, the calculation requires a relatively small memory. The numerical efficiency is further improved as the correlation functions belonging to various symmetry species are generated from a single wave packet. Comparison with existing data for the acetylene system confirms its accuracy and efficiency. }
