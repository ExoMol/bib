Abstract = {The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer
   (ACE-FTS) utilizes solar occultation to collect high-resolution
   measurements of atmospheric trace gases as the Sun rises or sets from
   the satellite's orbiting perspective. This limb-viewing geometry
   provides unique and vertically resolved observations of Earth's
   atmosphere. In this study, we present improved retrievals of ethylene
   (C2H4) from ACE-FTS, offering a comprehensive analysis of its global
   distribution and temporal variability. The retrievals were enhanced by
   applying speed-dependent Voigt line shapes to minimize systematic
   residuals from interfering CO2 lines, enabling more complete use of the
   available C2H4 spectral information in ACE measurements. The resulting
   dataset reveals notable enhancements in C2H4 concentrations over high
   northern latitudes, particularly between 5.5 and 8.5 km altitude.
   Distinct seasonal variability is observed, with elevated concentrations
   during winter and reduced levels in summer. Furthermore, a long-term
   decreasing trend of-0.224 ppt/year is identified over the 2004-2024
   period, indicating a gradual decline in atmospheric C2H4 levels.},

Rotational cooling is used to determine the various vibrational band centers by simplifying drastically the rotational band structure. A line-by-line assignment, based on a direct comparison with the TheoReTS variational line list and a systematic use of lower state combination difference (LSCD), is performed. Experimental line lists including line position and line integrated absorption cross sections are drawn up. The 6/8 K, 12 K and 38 K spectra contain 668, 1553 and 1679 absorption lines respectively. Overall, 320 rovibrational lines are assigned across 20 interacting vibrational bands. Among the 20 vibrational cold bands identified in this work, 14 had never been observed before. Line intensities are in the range of 10−24 - 10−20 cm/molecule. A direct comparison between our work and the TheoReTS and ExoMol theoretical line lists, as well as with the recent experimental work of Ben Fathallah et al. 2024 is provided.}

However, a better knowledge of spectroscopic parameters is needed for this molecule in order to detect its presence and/or to derive its accurate concentration. We present here a detailed analysis and modeling of the strongly absorbing ν9 and ν11 fundamental bands in the 3.3 µm region. Due to the complexity of the observed spectrum, we have built a polyad scheme taking into account some fundamental bands previously analyzed thanks to the tensorial formalism developed in Dijon for asymmetric-top molecules. A four polyad system has been settled and the last P3 polyad contains four vibrational states: ν9, ν11, ν2+ν12 and 2ν10+ν12. A first frequency analysis has been performed, leading to 3328 assignments with a root mean square of 5.927 ×10−3cm−1 and a standard deviation of 1.965 using 88 adjusted parameters, and we have also adjusted line intensities of 2190 lines by adjusting 14 parameters with an overall Root-Mean-Square (RMS) deviation of about 3.77%. A new linelist of calculated lines in the 2900−3300 cm−1 region has been added to the ECaSDa and we plan to integrate it to the HITRAN database.}

The investigated spectral interval coincides to a region of weak absorption of water, methane and acetylene. Quantitative information on the relatively strong C2H4 absorption in the region is valuable for trace detection applications. Relying on the position and intensity agreement with a line list of 12C2H4 transitions calculated by the variational method, 1674 transitions could be assigned to five bands (ν5+ν9, ν5+ν11, ν2+ν3 +ν11, ν2+ν6+ν9 and ν1+ν11). All the reported assignments are confirmed by Lower State Combination Difference (LSCD) relations i.e. all the upper states (607 in total) have coinciding determinations of their energies through several transitions (up to 6). The position and intensity comparisons between experiment and theory are discussed together with a comparison to previous works in the region.}

   between 5000 and 9000 cm-1},
Journal =JQSRT,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {310},
Abstract = {The absorption spectrum of ethylene (C2H4) in the range 5000-9000 cm-1
   has been recorded by high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy
   (FTS) at four temperatures (130, 201, 240 and 297 K) and two pressures
   for each temperature value. The recorded spectra show a very high
   spectral congestion even at the lowest temperature. Here we present the
   analysis of a subset of the data limited to a weak absorption interval
   (6700-7260 cm-1) at 130 and 297 K. An empirical list of 12,243 lines was
   retrieved from the 130 K spectrum. Line intensities range between about
   10-25 and 10-22 cm/molecule. In the 7120-7260 cm-1 region, a list of
   2276 lines was combined to the 130 K list to derive the empirical value
   of the lower state energy of 1249 transitions from the variation of the
   line intensity between 130 and 297 K (2T-method). The line list of
   12C2H4 transitions calculated by the variational method is provided in
   the 5200-9000 cm-1 range (241,921 and 179,927 transitions at 296 K and
   130 K, respectively, above an intensity cutoff of 1x10-25 cm/molecule).
   This list is an extension of the Theoretical Reims-Tomsk Spectral
   (TheoReTS) list available at lower energy. In spite of the considerable
   spectral congestion and of significant deviations between the
   variational and experimental line lists, 647 transitions could be
   rovibrationally assigned to seven vibrational bands in the FTS spectrum
   at 130 K between 6700 and 7260 cm-1. The assignments rely on the
   position and intensity agreement combined with a systematic use of Lower
   State Combination Difference (LSCD) relations. The comparison between
   the empirical values of the lower state energy and their exact value
   provided by the rovibrational assignment is discussed.},

Journal = {Sci. Rep.},

Volume = {{11}},
Abstract = {{Many plants, including fruits and vegetables, release biogenic gases
   containing various volatile organic compounds such as ethylene (C2H4),
   which is a gaseous phytohormone. Non-destructive and in-situ gas
   sampling technology to detect trace C2H4 released from plants in real
   time would be attractive for visualising the ageing, ripening, and
   defence reactions of plants. In this study, we developed a C2H4
   detection system with a detection limit of 0.8 ppb (3 sigma) using laser
   absorption spectroscopy. The C2H4 detection system consists of a
   mid-infrared quantum cascade laser oscillated at 10.5 mu m, a multi-pass
   gas cell, a mid-IR photodetector, and a gas sampling system. Using
   non-destructive and in-situ gas sampling, while maintaining the internal
   pressure of the multi-pass gas cell at low pressure, the change in trace
   C2H4 concentration released from apples (Malus domestica Borkh.) can be
   observed in real time. We succeeded in observing C2H4 concentration
   changes with a time resolution of 1 s, while changing the atmospheric
   gas and surface temperature of apples from the `Fuji' cultivar. This
   technique allows the visualisation of detailed C2H4 dynamics in plant
   environmental response, which may be promising for further progress in
   plant physiology, agriculture, and food science.}},

   for H atoms, and aug-cc-pVDZ basis for C, O, N atoms). Nitromethane has
   15 vibrational degrees of freedom, including one that is a nearly free
   internal methyl torsion, which is accurately described by the PES. This
   torsional mode makes vibrational calculations very challenging and here
   we present the results of calculations without it. Nevertheless, 14-mode
   calculations are still challenging and can lead to very large
   Hamiltonian matrices. To address this issue, we apply a pruning scheme,
   suggested previously by Handy and Carter, that reduces the size of
   matrix without sacrificing accuracy in the eigenvalues. The method is
   briefly described here in the context of partitioning theory. A new and
   more efficient implementation of it, coded in the latest version of

   demonstrated for 12-mode C2H4 and then applied to CH3NO2. Agreement with
   available experimental values of the CH3NO2 14 fundamentals is very
   good. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations in full dimensionality are done
   for the zero-point energy and wavefuction. These indicate that the

	were 0.023 cm(-1) for line positions and 13.86\% for line intensities
	in the Tetradecad region itself. Although this analysis is still
	preliminary, it is already sufficient to characterize the stronger
	bands throughout the whole of the Tetradecad. The calculated integrated

  abstract = {We explore the transmission spectrum of the Neptune-class exoplanet
	GJ 436b, including the possibility that its atmospheric opacity is
	dominated by a variety of nonequilibrium chemical products. We also
	validate our transmission code by demonstrating close agreement with
	analytic models that use only Rayleigh scattering or water vapor
	opacity. We find broad disagreement with radius variations predicted
	by another published model. For GJ 436b, the relative coolness of
	the planet's atmosphere, along with its implied high metallicity,
	may make it dissimilar in character compared to ``hot Jupiters.{''}
	Some recent observational and modeling efforts suggest low relative
	abundances of H2O and CH4 present in GJ 436b's atmosphere, compared
	to calculations from equilibrium chemistry. We include these characteristics
	in our models and examine the effects of absorption from methane-derived
	higher-order hydrocarbons. To our knowledge, the effects of these
	nonequilibrium chemical products on the spectra of close-in giant
	planets have not previously been investigated. Significant absorption
	from HCN and C2H2 is found throughout the infrared, while C2H4 and
	C2H6 are less easily seen. We perform detailed simulations of James
	Webb Space Telescope observations, including all likely noise sources,
	and find that we will be able to constrain chemical abundance regimes
	from this planet's transmission spectrum. For instance, the width
	of the features at 1.5, 3.3, and 7 mu m indicates the amount of HCN
	versus C2H2 present. The NIRSpec prism mode will be useful due to
	its large spectral range and the relatively large number of photo-electrons
	recorded per spectral resolution element. However, extremely bright
	host stars like GJ 436 may be better observed with a higher spectroscopic
	resolution mode in order to avoid detector saturation. We find that
	observations with the MIRI low-resolution spectrograph should also
	have high signal-to-noise in the 5-10 mu m range due to the brightness
	of the star and the relatively low spectral resolution (R similar
	to 100) of this mode.},

	of the molecules were excited to the pi 3s Rydberg state instead.
	The subsequent motion of the wave packet, moving over the potentials
	from the Franck-Condon region down to the ground state, was monitored
	by nonresonant ionization at 810 nm with mass-selective detection
	of the ion yield. Five time constants (from approximate to 20 fs

	coherent oscillations (CC stretch and torsion vibrations or hindered
	free rotation) were determined for each isotopomer. The initial relaxation
	follows a superposition of CC twist and stretch coordinates; this
	explains a surprisingly small deuterium isotope effect of the initial
	time constant (21 versus 24 fs). Also the vibrations in the Franck-Condon
	region have such a mixed character and a correspondingly small isotope
	shift. From the perpendicular minimum the wave packet reaches (within
	17 or 21 fs for the two isotopomers) a conical intersection via a
	direction that also involves partial hydrogen migration. This is
	concluded from the detection of ethylidene (CH3CH), formed simultaneously
	with ground-state ethylene. This carbene isomerizes in the ground
	state within 0.6 ps (1.6 ps for CD3CD) to ethylene. Two time constants

	identified. The small yields of bimolecular reactions (photodimerization,
	addition reactions involving a ``suddenly polarized{''} excited state,
	carbene reactions) are interpreted in terms of the short lifetimes.
	It is pointed out that the relaxation path starting from the Rydberg
	state merges into that from the pi pi{*} state; nevertheless, there
	is a wavelength dependence in the photochemistry of olefins, because

  pages = {2125-2136},
  abstract = {A new method which we refer to as vertical Franck-Condon is proposed
	to calculate electronic absorption spectra of polyatomic molecules.
	In accord with the short-time picture of spectroscopy, the excited-state
	potential energy surface is expanded at the ground-state equilibrium
	geometry and the focus of the approach is more on the overall shape
	of the spectrum and the positions of the band maxima, rather than
	the precise position of the 0-0 lines. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation
	and the separability of the excited-state potential energy surface
	along the excited-state normal mode coordinates are assumed. However,
	the potential surface is not necessarily approximated as harmonic
	oscillator potentials along the individual normal modes. Instead,
	depending upon the nature of the potential surface along a particular
	normal mode, it is treated either in the harmonic approximation or
	the full one-dimensional potential is considered along this mode.
	The vertical Franck-Condon approach is applicable therefore even
	in cases where the excited state potential energy surface is highly
	anharmonic and the conventional harmonic Franck-Condon approach is
	inadequate. As an application of the method, the ultraviolet spectrum
	of ethylene between 6.2 eV (50 000 cm-1) and 8.7 eV (70 000 cm-1)
	is simulated, using the Similarity Transformed Equation of Motion
	Coupled-Cluster method to describe the required features of the potential
	energy surfaces. The spectrum is shown to be a result of sharp doublet
	structures stemming from the pi-->3s (Rydberg) state superimposed
	on top of a broad band resulting from the pi-->pi{*} (valence) state.
	For the Rydberg state, the symmetric C=C stretch and the torsion
	mode contribute to the spectrum, while the broad valence band results
	from excitation into the C=C stretch, CH2 scissors, and the torsion
	mode. For both states, the potential along the torsion mode is highly
	anharmonic and the full treatment of the potential along this mode
	in the vertical Franck-Condon method is required. (C) 2004 American

	photodissociation study of acetylene C2H2. From the dissociation
	threshold measurements, several barrierless processes are evidenced.
	In particular, the excited CH{*} (A or B) radical is formed via an
	intermediate isomer, ethylidene, with no excess energy. More surprisingly,
	all channels involving one H-2 molecular elimination are observed
	without any barrier, unlike the dissociation processes occurring
	on the ground state potential energy surface (PES) of C2H4. Most
	probably, this observation originates from all easier relaxation

	path integral quantum Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach which has been
	combined with different electronic Hamiltonians. The nuclear potential
	V(R) in the PIMC step of the present formalism has been modeled by
	an efficient tight-binding one-electron Hamiltonian. Electronic expectation
	values in thermal equilibrium have been evaluated by ab initio Hartree-Fock
	and Moller-Plesset calculations. The quantum degrees of freedom of
	the ethylene nuclei as well as the anharmonicities in V(R) cause
	sizable elongations of the bond lengths relative to the hypothetical
	vibrationless values at the minimum of the potential energy surface.
	The PIMC results demonstrate impressively the wave-packet character
	of the nuclear wave function. This effect is neglected in the crude
	Born-Oppenheimer approximation which forms the basis of the large
	majority of electronic structure calculations of molecules. The nuclear
	degrees of freedom have a strong influence on the expectation values
	of the electronic Hamiltonian. The isotope and temperature dependence
	of these quantities has been analyzed. The nuclear fluctuations attenuate
	the nuclear-nuclear and electron-electron repulsions and lower the
	electronic kinetic energy. These stabilizing shifts in thermal equilibrium
	compete with a destabilization of the electron-nuclear attraction.
	The analysis of the ensemble averaged electronic quantities offers
	insight into the modifications of covalent bonding under the conditions
	of thermal equilibrium. Conceptual problems of classical Monte Carlo
	simulations as well as the shortcomings of electronic structure calculations
	on the basis of a single nuclear configuration in molecules with
	light atoms are emphasized. It is demonstrated that the nuclear degrees
	of freedom up to room temperature of the ethylene isomers studied
	are caused by quantum tunneling. Physical implications which follow
	from the present PIMC - ab initio investigation are mentioned concisely.

	on ab initio ethylene ground-state surfaces of which most were reported

	distributed statistically and the energy released by the exit barrier
	is described by the modified impulsive model. The rate constants

	However, the computed variational transition states for H loss appear
	reasonable as indicated by the translational energy. That with present

	Analysis of the H-2 translational energy measured at 193 and 157

	of much higher ``exit barrier'' than the one computed. For the (1,2E)

	are reproduced to better than 10 cm(-1), except for three cases where

	a thorough revision of the accepted cm experimentally derived values.
	Our computed and empirically corrected r(e) geometry differs substantially
	from experimentally derived values: Both the predicted r(z) geometry
	and the ground-state rotational constants are, however, in excellent
	agreement with experiment, suggesting revision of the older values.
	Anharmonicity constants agree well with experiment for stretches,
	but differ substantially for stretch-bend interaction constants,
	due to equality constraints in the experimental analysis that do
	not hold. Improved criteria for detecting Fermi and Coriolis resonances
	are proposed and found to work well, contrary to the established
	method based on harmonic frequency differences that fails to detect
	several important resonances for C2H4 and its isotopomers. Surprisingly
	good results are obtained with a small spd basis at the CCSD(T) level.
	The well-documented strong basis set effect on the v(8) out-of-plane
	motion is present to a much lesser extent when correlation-optimized

	varying the stratospheric thermal profile, a 67-137 K increase in

	altitude information on the thermal structure can be obtained for

	progression is observed in the 3s spectrum, tentatively assigned

	via excitation of the b1u nu-6 CH2 antisymmetric scissors mode. Polarization
	ratio measurements and identification of the previously unreported
	3p-sigma origin band show that the energies of the 3p levels are
	in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Higher-lying members
	of the s- and p-Rydberg series are not observed, suggestive of the
	onset of strong predissociation. These first observations of the
	two-photon allowed nf-Rydberg series yield ionization potential estimates
