	emission as a function of longitude was obtained with an instantaneous
	field of view (full width at half maximum) of approximately 1 arc
	sec on the planet. The greatest C2H4 emission was observed near the
	nominal north polar methane hot spot (60-degrees-N, 180-degrees longitude,
	System III, 1965). It was found to be confined to <10-degrees longitude
	on the planet. Using a Voyager-derived thermal profile, retrieved
	ethylene mole fractions for equatorial and north polar quiescent
	(non-hot spot) regions were consistent with results from existing
	photochemical models. At the hot spot an 18-fold increase in abundance
	was required near the 10-mubar level to reproduce the data. Alternatively
	varying the stratospheric thermal profile, a 67-137 K increase in
	temperature was required at the approximately 10-mubar level to satisfy
	the observed emission, if the C2H4 mole fraction is fixed to the
	quiescent value. These results provide the first direct probe of
	the upper stratosphere of Jupiter and give upper limits to the temperature
	increase near the source of the north polar thermal infrared aurora.
	Combined with results from similar measurements of auroral ethane
	emission (Livengood et al., this issue) probing the 1-mbar region,
	altitude information on the thermal structure can be obtained for
	the first time. The ethylene line emission region extends to the
	few microbar pressure level and may overlap the region where the
	H-2 ultraviolet aurora is formed; thus it can be used as a probe

	Our computed and empirically corrected r(e) geometry differs substantially
	from experimentally derived values: Both the predicted r(z) geometry
	and the ground-state rotational constants are, however, in excellent
	agreement with experiment, suggesting revision of the older values.
	Anharmonicity constants agree well with experiment for stretches,
	but differ substantially for stretch-bend interaction constants,
	due to equality constraints in the experimental analysis that do
	not hold. Improved criteria for detecting Fermi and Coriolis resonances
	are proposed and found to work well, contrary to the established
	method based on harmonic frequency differences that fails to detect
	several important resonances for C2H4 and its isotopomers. Surprisingly
	good results are obtained with a small spd basis at the CCSD(T) level.
	The well-documented strong basis set effect on the v(8) out-of-plane
	motion is present to a much lesser extent when correlation-optimized
	polarization functions are used. Complete sets of anharmonic, rovibrational
	coupling, and centrifugal distortion constants for the isotopomers

	vacuum vessel at 10 K with 9.0 MeV alpha-particles and 7.3 MeV protons
	to elucidate mechanisms to form hydrocarbon molecules upon interaction
	of Galactic cosmic-ray particles with extraterrestrial, organic ices.
	Theoretical calculations focus on computer simulations of ion-induced
	collision cascades in irradiated targets. Our experimental and computational
	investigations reveal that each MeV particle transfers its kinetic
	energy predominantly through inelastic encounters to the target leading
	to electronic excitation and ionization of the target molecules.
	Here electronically excited CH4 species can fragment to mobile H
	atoms and non-mobile CH3 radicals. The potential energy stored in
	Coulomb Interaction of the CH4+ ions release energetic H and C atoms
	not in thermal equilibrium with the 10 K target (suprathermal species).
	Moderated to 1-10 eV kinetic energy, these carbon atoms and those
	triggered by the elastic energy transfer of the MeV projectile to
	the target are found to abstract up to two H atoms to yield suprathermal
	CH and CH2 species. C and CH, as well as CH2, can insert into a C-H
	bond of a CH4 molecule to form methylcarbene (HCCH3), the ethyl radical
	(C2H5), and ethane (C2H6). HCCH3 either loses H-2/2H to form acetylene,
	C2H2, rearranges to ethylene, C2H4, or adds two H atoms to form ethane,
	C2H6. C2H5 can abstract or lose an H atom, giving ethane and ethylene,
	respectively. C2H2 and C2H4 are found to react with suprathermal
	H atoms to form C2H3 and C2H5, respectively. Overlapping cascades
	and an increasing MeV ion exposure transforms C2Hx (x = 2, ..., 6)
	to even more complex alkanes up to C14H30. These elementary reactions
	of suprathermal species to insert, abstract, and add in/to bonds
	supply a powerful pathway to form new molecules in icy grain mantles

  abstract = {Attention is focused on the quantitative relationships between the
	parameters of the normal mode and the local mode effective Hamiltonian
	models of anharmonic stretching vibrations. R. G. Della Valle (1988,
	Molec. Phys., 63, 611) has demonstrated the general relationship
	between the harmonically coupled anharmonic (Morse) oscillators (HCAO)
	model and the normal mode model of X-H (or X-D or other weakly coupled)
	stretching vibrations of polyatomic molecules. Here we consider more
	fully the relationship between the normal mode and the anharmonically
	coupled local mode models for X-H stretching vibrations. The local
	mode Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of boson shift operators and
	these operators are then transformed into the corresponding normal
	mode model operators. Such relationships have already been derived
	for the special cases of H2X (Baggott, J. E., 1988, Molec. Phys.,
	65, 739), XH3 (C-3v) and XH4 (T-d) (Law, M. M., and Duncan, J. L.,
	1994, Molec. Phys., 83, 757) and here they are derived systematically
	for arbitrary local mode stretching systems. Explicit relationships
	are derived for molecules of the symmetry types of allene, ethylene
	and benzene respectively. These relationships between the unconstrained
	normal mode and anharmonically coupled local mode models allow for
	more reliable schemes for the relaxation of the HCAO x,K-relations
	than those suggested hitherto. In an application to the ethylene-d4
	overtone spectrum a much improved fit to experimental data is obtained
	using a compact anharmonically coupled local mode model and the consequences
	for the corresponding normal mode model demonstrated. The generality
	of our results is emphasized by the application to systems involving
	non-equivalent bonds, illustrated with reference to HCN/DCN. Approximations
	in these local to normal mode transformations (such as the assumption
	of a unitary transformation) are discussed. The models presented
	here may be supplemented with appropriate matrix elements to take
	account of Fermi resonances in the same straightforward manner as
	the HCAO model.},

	on ab initio ethylene ground-state surfaces of which most were reported
	earlier. In the calculations of the energy partitions, a simple model
	was used in which the excess energy above the transition state is
	distributed statistically and the energy released by the exit barrier
	is described by the modified impulsive model. The rate constants
	of the ethylene H(D) elimination were calculated according to the
	variational RRKM (Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus) theory, and the
	RRKM rate constants with tunneling corrections were obtained for

	However, the computed variational transition states for H loss appear
	reasonable as indicated by the translational energy. That with present

	the predicted transition states though the process is nonstatistical.
	Analysis of the H-2 translational energy measured at 193 and 157

	The role of vibrational relaxation on the line shapes was described
	by a moment method which considers the case of symmetric core holes

	path integral quantum Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach which has been

	V(R) in the PIMC step of the present formalism has been modeled by
	an efficient tight-binding one-electron Hamiltonian. Electronic expectation
	values in thermal equilibrium have been evaluated by ab initio Hartree-Fock
	and Moller-Plesset calculations. The quantum degrees of freedom of

	sizable elongations of the bond lengths relative to the hypothetical
	vibrationless values at the minimum of the potential energy surface.
	The PIMC results demonstrate impressively the wave-packet character
	of the nuclear wave function. This effect is neglected in the crude
	Born-Oppenheimer approximation which forms the basis of the large
	majority of electronic structure calculations of molecules. The nuclear
	degrees of freedom have a strong influence on the expectation values
	of the electronic Hamiltonian. The isotope and temperature dependence
	of these quantities has been analyzed. The nuclear fluctuations attenuate
	the nuclear-nuclear and electron-electron repulsions and lower the
	electronic kinetic energy. These stabilizing shifts in thermal equilibrium
	compete with a destabilization of the electron-nuclear attraction.
	The analysis of the ensemble averaged electronic quantities offers
	insight into the modifications of covalent bonding under the conditions
	of thermal equilibrium. Conceptual problems of classical Monte Carlo
	simulations as well as the shortcomings of electronic structure calculations
	on the basis of a single nuclear configuration in molecules with
	light atoms are emphasized. It is demonstrated that the nuclear degrees
	of freedom up to room temperature of the ethylene isomers studied
	are caused by quantum tunneling. Physical implications which follow

  journal = JCP,

  volume = {121},
  pages = {2125-2136},
  abstract = {A new method which we refer to as vertical Franck-Condon is proposed
	to calculate electronic absorption spectra of polyatomic molecules.
	In accord with the short-time picture of spectroscopy, the excited-state
	potential energy surface is expanded at the ground-state equilibrium
	geometry and the focus of the approach is more on the overall shape
	of the spectrum and the positions of the band maxima, rather than
	the precise position of the 0-0 lines. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation
	and the separability of the excited-state potential energy surface
	along the excited-state normal mode coordinates are assumed. However,
	the potential surface is not necessarily approximated as harmonic
	oscillator potentials along the individual normal modes. Instead,
	depending upon the nature of the potential surface along a particular
	normal mode, it is treated either in the harmonic approximation or
	the full one-dimensional potential is considered along this mode.
	The vertical Franck-Condon approach is applicable therefore even
	in cases where the excited state potential energy surface is highly
	anharmonic and the conventional harmonic Franck-Condon approach is
	inadequate. As an application of the method, the ultraviolet spectrum
	of ethylene between 6.2 eV (50 000 cm-1) and 8.7 eV (70 000 cm-1)
	is simulated, using the Similarity Transformed Equation of Motion
	Coupled-Cluster method to describe the required features of the potential
	energy surfaces. The spectrum is shown to be a result of sharp doublet

	C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CH3C2H, C3H8, C4H2, C6H6 and HCN, along with the
	temperature profiles in Titan's atmosphere. We analyzed two sets
	of spectra, one at 15 degrees S (Tb flyby) and the other one at 80
	degrees N (T3 flyby). The spectral range 600-1400 cm(-1), recorded
	at a resolution of 0.5 cm(-1), was used to determine molecular abundances
	and temperatures in the stratosphere in the altitude range 100-460
	km for Tb and 170-495 km for T3. Both temperature profiles show a
	well defined stratopause, at around 310 km (0.07 mbar) and 183 K
	at 13 degrees S, and 380 km (0.01 mbar) with 207 K at 80 degrees
	N. Near the north pole, stratospheric temperatures are colder and
	mesospheric temperatures are warmer than near the equator. C2H2,
	C2H6, C3H8 and HCN display vertical mixing ratio profiles that increase
	with height at 15 degrees S and 80 degrees N, consistent with their
	formation in the upper atmosphere, diffusion downwards and condensation
	in the lower stratosphere, as expected from photochemical models.
	The CH3C2H and C4H2 mixing ratios also increase with height at 15
	degrees S. But near the north pole, their profiles present an unexpected
	minimum around 300 km, observed for the first time thanks to the
	high vertical resolution of the CIRS limb data. C2H4 is the only
	molecule having a vertical abundance profile that decreases with
	height at 15 degrees S. At 800 N, it also displays a minimum of its
	mixing ratio around the 0.1-mbar level. For C6H6, an upper limit
	of 1.1 ppb (in the 0.3-10 mbar range) is derived at 15 degrees S,
	whereas a constant mixing ratio profile of 3(-1.5)(+3) pole. 1 5
	ppb is inferred near the north At 15 degrees S, the vertical profile
	of HCN exhibits a steeper gradient than other molecules, which suggests
	that a sink for this molecule exists in the stratosphere, possibly
	due to haze formation. All molecules display a more or less pronounced
	enrichment towards the north pole, probably due, in part, to subsidence
	of air at the north (winter) pole that brings air enriched in photochemical
	compounds from the upper atmosphere to lower levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier

	In contrast to traditional MRMP or multistate multiconfiguration

	self-consistent field methods, our reference functions are represented
	in terms of computationally efficient IVOs. For convenience in comparisons

	effects. The potential energy curves calculated from the IVO-MRMP
	method are compared with computations using state-of-the-art coupled
	cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods and variants thereof to
	assess the efficacy of the IVO-MRMP scheme. The present study clearly
	demonstrates that unlike the CCSD and its variants, the IVO-MRMP

	curves for isomerization of these systems. Although the rigorously

	C2D4 in the maximum of the first pi pi{*} transition. Around 10\%
	of the molecules were excited to the pi 3s Rydberg state instead.
	The subsequent motion of the wave packet, moving over the potentials
	from the Franck-Condon region down to the ground state, was monitored
	by nonresonant ionization at 810 nm with mass-selective detection
	of the ion yield. Five time constants (from approximate to 20 fs
	in excited states to 0.6-11 ps in the hot ground state) and four
	coherent oscillations (CC stretch and torsion vibrations or hindered
	free rotation) were determined for each isotopomer. The initial relaxation
	follows a superposition of CC twist and stretch coordinates; this
	explains a surprisingly small deuterium isotope effect of the initial
	time constant (21 versus 24 fs). Also the vibrations in the Franck-Condon
	region have such a mixed character and a correspondingly small isotope
	shift. From the perpendicular minimum the wave packet reaches (within
	17 or 21 fs for the two isotopomers) a conical intersection via a
	direction that also involves partial hydrogen migration. This is
	concluded from the detection of ethylidene (CH3CH), formed simultaneously
	with ground-state ethylene. This carbene isomerizes in the ground
	state within 0.6 ps (1.6 ps for CD3CD) to ethylene. Two time constants
	for dissociation (4.5 and 11 ps) in the hot ground state were also
	identified. The small yields of bimolecular reactions (photodimerization,
	addition reactions involving a ``suddenly polarized{''} excited state,
	carbene reactions) are interpreted in terms of the short lifetimes.
	It is pointed out that the relaxation path starting from the Rydberg
	state merges into that from the pi pi{*} state; nevertheless, there
	is a wavelength dependence in the photochemistry of olefins, because
	due to a momentum effect the wave packet remembers from which state
	it came.},

	extended spectral range involved in this study, a much larger set
	of line assignments are now available. The present analysis has lead
	to the determination of more accurate spectroscopic constants, including
	interaction constants, than were obtained in earlier studies. In
	particular, the following band centers were derived: v(0)(v(10))=825.40602(30)cm(-1),

	by another published model. For GJ 436b, the relative coolness of
	the planet's atmosphere, along with its implied high metallicity,
	may make it dissimilar in character compared to ``hot Jupiters.{''}
	Some recent observational and modeling efforts suggest low relative
	abundances of H2O and CH4 present in GJ 436b's atmosphere, compared
	to calculations from equilibrium chemistry. We include these characteristics
	in our models and examine the effects of absorption from methane-derived
	higher-order hydrocarbons. To our knowledge, the effects of these
	nonequilibrium chemical products on the spectra of close-in giant
	planets have not previously been investigated. Significant absorption
	from HCN and C2H2 is found throughout the infrared, while C2H4 and
	C2H6 are less easily seen. We perform detailed simulations of James
	Webb Space Telescope observations, including all likely noise sources,
	and find that we will be able to constrain chemical abundance regimes
	from this planet's transmission spectrum. For instance, the width
	of the features at 1.5, 3.3, and 7 mu m indicates the amount of HCN
	versus C2H2 present. The NIRSpec prism mode will be useful due to
	its large spectral range and the relatively large number of photo-electrons
	recorded per spectral resolution element. However, extremely bright
	host stars like GJ 436 may be better observed with a higher spectroscopic
	resolution mode in order to avoid detector saturation. We find that
	observations with the MIRI low-resolution spectrograph should also
	have high signal-to-noise in the 5-10 mu m range due to the brightness
	of the star and the relatively low spectral resolution (R similar
	to 100) of this mode.},

	processes in which hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing molecules
	are produced through ion-molecule reactions. The structure and composition
	of Titan's ionosphere has been extensively investigated by the Ion
	and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft.
	We present a detailed study using linear correlation analysis, 1-D
	photochemical modeling, and empirical modeling of Titan's dayside
	ionosphere constrained by Cassini measurements. The 1-D photochemical
	model is found to reproduce the primary photoionization products
	of N(2) and CH(4). The major ions, CH(5)(+), C(2)H(5)(+), and HCNH(+)
	are studied extensively to determine the primary processes controlling
	their production and loss. To further investigate the chemistry of
	Titan's ionosphere we present an empirical model of the ion densities
	that calculates the ion densities using the production and loss rates
	derived from the INMS data. We find that the chemistry included in
	our model sufficiently reproduces the hydrocarbon species as observed
	by the INMS. However, we find that the chemistry from previous models
	appears insufficient to accurately reproduce the nitrogen-containing
	organic compound abundances observed by the INMS. The major ion,
	HCNH(+), is found to be overproduced in both the empirical and 1-D
	photochemical models. We analyze the processes producing and consuming
	HCNH(+) in order to determine the cause of this discrepancy. We find
	that a significant chemical loss process is needed. We suggest that
	the loss process must be with one of the major components, namely
	C(2)H(2), C(2)H(4), or H(2).},

	structure calculations of the underlying potential energy surface
	(PES) and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) estimates of rates

	of the experimental results. The reaction proceeds via insertion
	of C(D-1) into one of the C-H bonds of methane leading to the formation
	of the intermediate HCCH3 (methylcarbene or ethylidene), which either
	decomposes directly into the products C2H3 + H or C2H2 + H-2 or isomerizes
	to the more stable ethylene, which in turn dissociates into C2H3
	+ H or H2CC + H-2. The experimental results indicate that the H-displacement
	and H-2-elimination channels are of equal importance and that for
	both channels the reaction mechanism is controlled by the presence
	of a bound intermediate, the lifetime of which is comparable to its
	rotational period. On the contrary, RRKM estimates predict a very
	short lifetime for the insertion intermediate and the dominance of
	the H-displacement channel. It is concluded that the reaction C(D-1)

	is necessary to understand its mechanism. Possibly, nonadiabatic
	effects are responsible for the discrepancies, as triplet and singlet
	PES of methylcarbene cross each other and intersystem crossing is

Abstract = {{The 6-12 mu m spectrum of Neptune has been recorded with the PHT-S
   instrument of the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) at a resolution of
   0.095 mu m. In addition to the emissions of CH4, CH3D and C2H6
   previously identified, the spectrum shows the first firm identification
   of ethylene C2H4. The inferred column density above the 0.2-mbar level
   is in the range (1.1-3)x10(14) molecules cm(-2). To produce this low
   amount, previous photochemical models invoked rapid mixing between the
   source and sink regions of C2H4. We show that this requirement can be
   relaxed if recent laboratory measurements of CH4 photolysis branching
   ratios at Lyman alpha are used.}}}

Abstract = {{We report vibrational self-consistent field/virtual state configuration
   interaction energies of nitromethane using the code MULTIMODE and a new
   full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES). The PES is a precise,
   permutationally invariant linear least-squares fit to 17 049 electronic
   energies, using the CCSD(T)-F12b method with HaDZ basis (cc-pVDZ basis
   for H atoms, and aug-cc-pVDZ basis for C, O, N atoms). Nitromethane has
   15 vibrational degrees of freedom, including one that is a nearly free
   internal methyl torsion, which is accurately described by the PES. This
   torsional mode makes vibrational calculations very challenging and here
   we present the results of calculations without it. Nevertheless, 14-mode
   calculations are still challenging and can lead to very large
   Hamiltonian matrices. To address this issue, we apply a pruning scheme,
   suggested previously by Handy and Carter, that reduces the size of
   matrix without sacrificing accuracy in the eigenvalues. The method is
   briefly described here in the context of partitioning theory. A new and
   more efficient implementation of it, coded in the latest version of
   MULTIMODE program, is described. The accuracy and efficiency are
   demonstrated for 12-mode C2H4 and then applied to CH3NO2. Agreement with
   available experimental values of the CH3NO2 14 fundamentals is very
   good. Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations in full dimensionality are done
   for the zero-point energy and wavefuction. These indicate that the
   torisonal motion is nearly a free-rotor in this state.}},
