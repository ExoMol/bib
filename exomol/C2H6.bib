Abstract = {Ethane pyrolysis chemistry plays a critical role in the combustion
   behavior of natural gas and gives insight into the decomposition
   patterns of larger alkanes. In this work, ethane pyrolysis was studied
   behind reflected shock waves with a convex optimization-based laser
   absorption speciation technique. Species time-histories of ethane,
   ethylene, methane, and acetylene were quantified in the decomposition of
   1\% and 2\% ethane in argon at conditions between 1178 and 1527 K and
   3.1-4.2 atm. Six laser wavelengths, simultaneously probing sensitive
   regions of each species' spectra, enabled the sensitive detection of all
   major pyrolysis products and confirmed the negligible formation of other
   species. The time-history data presented in this work paint a coherent
   picture of ethane decomposition that motivates specific refinements to
   state-of-the-art detailed kinetic models.},

Abstract = {The Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observed thermal
   emission in the far- and mid-infrared (from 10 to 1500 cm(-1)), enabling
   spatiotemporal studies of ethane on Titan across the span of the Cassini
   mission from 2004 through 2017. Many previous measurements of ethane on
   Titan have relied on modeling the molecule's mid-infrared v(12) band,
   centered on 822 cm(-1). Other bands of ethane at shorter and longer
   wavelengths were seen, but have not been modeled to measure ethane
   abundance. Spectral line lists of the far-infrared v(4) torsional band
   at 289 cm(-1) and the mid-infrared v(8) band centered at 1468 cm(-1)
   have recently been studied in the laboratory. We model CIRS observations
   of each of these bands (along with the v(12) band) separately and
   compare the retrieved mixing ratios from each spectral region. Nadir
   observations of the v(4) band probe the low stratosphere below 100 km.
   Our equatorial measurements at 289 cm(-1) show an abundance of (1.0 +/-
   0.4) x 10(-5) at 88 km from 2007 to 2017. This mixing ratio is
   consistent with measurements at higher altitudes, in contrast to the
   depletion that many photochemical models predict. Measurements from the
   v(12) and v(8) bands are comparable to each other, with the v(12) band
   probing an altitude range that extends deeper in the atmosphere. We
   suggest that future studies of planetary atmospheres may observe the
   v(8) band, enabling shorter wavelength studies of ethane. There may also
   be an advantage to observing both the ethane v(8) band and nearby
   methane v(4) band in the same spectral window.},

Title = {{Selective C-H bond activation of ethane by free gold clusters}},
Journal = IJMS,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {435},
Pages = {241-250},
Abstract = {The activation and potential dissociation of ethane mediated by small
   cationic gold clusters Au-x(+)(x = 2-4) has been explored by infrared
   multiple photon dissociation (IR-MPD) spectroscopy and density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculations show that the
   interaction between the gold clusters and ethane is mainly governed by
   the mixing of the ethane CH3 bond-forming orbitals pi-(CH3) with gold
   d-orbitals. While the CC single bond appears to be unaffected, this
   mixing leads to the selective activation of up to two ethane C-H bonds
   and a reduction of the activation barrier for C-H bond dissociation to
   up to 0.82 eV, making the reaction kinetically feasible at room
   temperature. In agreement with this, experimental IR-MPD spectra of the
   complexes Au-2(C2H6)(2)(+) and Au-2(C2D6)(2)(+) show strong indications
   for the co-existence of two isomeric structures, one representing the
   encounter complex and one where a single ethane C-H bond is dissociated
   resulting in a complex which contains an ethyl group and a bridge-bonded
   H atom along with a second, adsorbed C2H6 molecule. A similar C-H bond
   dissociation mechanism is theoretically predicted for the
   Au-3(C2H6)(y)(+) (y = 2,3) and Au-4(C2H6)(y)(+) (y = 2,3) complexes,
   albeit thermodynamically less favorable. IR-MPD spectra of
   Au-3(C2H6)(y)(+) (y = 2,3) and Au-4(C2H6)(y)(+) (y = 2,3) confirm the
   encounter product to be the dominant one, although the co-existence of
   isomers containing ethyl groups cannot be excluded. Various pathways for
   C-H bond activation are theoretically explored and the ethane activation
   mechanism is compared to the gold mediated activation of methane and
   ethylene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Abundances of C2H4, CH3C2H, C4H2 and C6H6 from Voyager-IRIS and
   Cassini-CIRS}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {328},
Pages = {176-193},
Abstract = {We present an analysis of Voyager-1-IRIS and Cassini-CIRS spectra of
   Jupiter's high latitudes acquired during the spacecrafts' respective
   flybys in November 1979 and January 2001. We performed a forward-model
   analysis in order to derive the abundances of ethylene (C2H4),
   methylacetylene (CH3C2H), diacetylene (C4H2) and benzene (C6H6) in
   Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions. We also compared these
   abundances to: 1) lower latitude abundances predicted by the Moses et
   al. (2005) `Model A' photochemical model, henceforth `Moses 2005A', and
   2) abundances derived at non-auroral longitudes in the same latitude
   band. This paper serves as an extension of Sinclair et al. (2017b),
   where we retrieved the vertical profiles of temperature, C2H2 and C2H6
   from similar datasets. We find that an enrichment of C2H4, CH3C2H and
   C6H6 with respect to lower-latitude abundances is required to fit the
   spectra of Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions. For example,
   for CIRS 0.5 cm(-1) spectra of Jupiter's southern auroral region, scale
   factor enrichments of 6.40(-1.15)(+1.30) and 9.60(-3.67)(+3.98) are
   required with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profiles of C2H4 and
   C6H6, respectively, in order to fit the spectral emission features of
   these species at similar to 950 and similar to 674 cm(-1). Similarly, in
   order to fit the CIRS 2.5 cm(-1) spectra of Jupiter's northern auroral
   region, scale factor enrichments of 1.60(-0.21)(+0.37),
   3.40(-1.69)(+1.89) and 15.00(-4.02)(+4.01) with respect to the Moses
   2005A vertical profiles of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 were required,
   respectively. Outside of Jupiter's auroral region in the same latitude
   bands, only upper-limit abundances of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 could be
   determined due to the limited sensitivity of the measurements, the
   weaker emission features combined with cooler stratospheric temperatures
   (and therefore decreased thermal emission) of these regions.
   Nevertheless, for a subset of the observations, derived abundances of
   C2H4 and C6H6 in Jupiter's auroral regions were higher (by 1 sigma) with
   respect to upper-limit abundances derived outside the auroral region in
   the same latitude band. This is suggestive that the influx of energetic
   ions and electrons from the Jovian magnetosphere and external solar-wind
   environment into the neutral atmosphere in Jupiter's auroral regions
   drives enhanced ion-related chemistry, as has also been inferred from
   Cassini observations of Saturn's high latitudes (Fletcher et al., 2018;
   Guerlet et al., 2015; Koskinen et al., 2016). We were not able to
   constrain the abundance of C4H2 in either Jupiter's auroral regions or
   non-auroral regions due to its lower (predicted) abundance and weaker
   emission feature. Thus, only upper-limit abundances were derived in both
   locations. From CIRS 2.5 cm(-1) spectra, the upper limit abundance of
   C4H2 corresponds to a scale factor enhancement of 45.6 and 23.8 with
   respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profile in Jupiter's non-auroral and
   auroral regions.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2018},

pages = {214305},
Abstract = {We present the first quantum mechanical model of the collisional
   dissipation of the alignment of a gas of symmetric-top molecules
   (ethane) impulsively induced by a linearly polarized non-resonant laser
   field. The approach is based on use of the Bloch model and of the Markov
   and secular approximations in which the effects of collisions are taken
   into account through the state-to-state rates associated with exchanges
   among the various rotational states. These rates are constructed using
   the Energy Corrected Sudden (ECS) approximation with (a few) input
   parameters obtained independently from fits of the pressure-broadening
   coefficients of ethane absorption lines. Based on knowledge of the laser
   pulse characteristics and on these rates, the time-dependent equation
   driving the evolution of the density matrix during and after the laser
   pulse is solved and the time dependence of the so-called ``alignment
   factor{''} is computed. Comparisons with measurements, free of any
   adjusted parameter, show that the proposed approach leads to good
   agreement with measurements. The analysis of the ECS state-to state
   collisional rates demonstrates that, as in the case of linear molecules,
   collision-induced changes of the rotational angular momentum orientation
   are slower than those of its magnitude. This explains why the
   collisional decay of the permanent component of the alignment is
   significantly slower than that of the amplitudes of the transient
   revivals in both experimental and computed results. It is also shown
   that, since intermolecular forces within C2H6 colliding pairs weakly
   depend on rotations of the molecules around their C-C bond, the
   dissipation mechanism of the alignment in pure ethane is close to that
   involved in linear molecules. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Abstract = {The pure rotational Raman linewidths of the symmetric-top molecule C2H6
   are determined from a time-resolved femtosecond experiment at room
   temperature and moderate pressure in a pump-probe scheme. After
   excitation by a strong 100 fs-duration nonresonant near infrared pump
   pulse, the molecular sample exhibits periodic post-pulse alignment
   revivals that produce an anisotropic angular distribution of the
   molecular axis. Such molecular motion induces in turn a time-dependent
   optical birefringence, which can be probed using a weak time-delayed
   probe pulse. The Fourier transform of the temporal signal, recorded over
   a wide time delay range (several hundred picoseconds) for high frequency
   resolution, is directly related to the rotational Raman spectrum of
   ethane molecules. The Raman lines are analyzed with a frequency
   lineshape taking into account the collisional relaxation and the
   apparatus function. The linewidths are measured for rotational quantum
   numbers J=3 to J=30 in the pressure range 0.69-1.06 bar. A decrease of

Abstract = {We have investigated the anomalous torsional behavior in the coupled
   nu(9) and nu(10) vibrational fundamentals of (CH3CH3)-C-12-C-13, both
   states exhibiting a splitting into three components, instead of two,
   only in those rotational levels which are very close to resonance. We
   conclude that the intrinsic additional splitting, which occurs in the
   E-torsional components, for these two vibrational states is too small to
   be detected in the high resolution infrared spectrum, but it is
   substantively enhanced by their coupling. It is shown that this effect
   requires the simultaneous action of torsion independent operators, such
   as Fermi-type and z-Coriolis, not allowed in the more symmetric
   isotopologue (CH3CH3)-C-12-C-12, and torsion dependent operators, such
   as torsional-Coriolis, connecting the two vibrational states. Our
   conclusions lead to a simple model for the coupling of nu(9) and nu(10),
   with effective Fermi-type matrix elements W for the A-torsional
   components, and W +/- w for the two pairs of E-torsional components.
   This causes the additional splitting in the E-pairs.
   This model is consistent with the mechanism causing the
   Coriolis-dependent decrease of the A-E torsional splitting in degenerate
   vibrational states.
   Exploratory calculations were performed making use of results from a
   normal mode analysis, showing that the effects predictable by the
   proposed model are of the correct order of magnitude compared to the
   observed features, with coupling parameter values reasonably consistent
   with those determined by the least squares fit of the observed

Abstract = {We describe the University of Colorado mobile Solar Occultation Flux
   instrument (CU mobile SOF). The instrument consists of a digital mobile
   solar tracker that is coupled to a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS)
   of 0.5 cm (-1) resolution and a UV-visible spectrometer (UV-vis) of 0.55
   nm resolution. The instrument is used to simultaneously measure the
   absorption of ammonia (NH3 /, ethane (C2H6 /and nitrogen dioxide (NO2
   /along the direct solar beam from a moving laboratory. These direct-sun
   observations provide high photon flux and enable measurements of
   vertical column densities (VCDs) with geometric air mass factors, high
   temporal resolution of 2 s and spatial resolution of 5-19 m. It is shown
   that the instrument line shape (ILS) of the FTS is independent of the
   azimuth and elevation angle pointing of the solar tracker. Further,
   collocated measurements next to a high-resolution FTS at the National
   Center for Atmospheric Research (HR-NCAR-FTS) show that the CU mobile
   SOF measurements of NH3 and C2H6 are precise and accurate; the VCD error
   at high signal to noise ratio is 2-7 \%. During the Front Range Air
   Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) from 21 July to 3
   September 2014 in Colorado, the CU mobile SOF instrument measured median
   (minimum, maxi-mum) VCDs of 4.3 (0.5, 45) x 10(16) molecules cm (-2)
   NH3, 0.30 (0.06, 2.23) x 10(16) molecules cm (-2) NO2 and 3.5 (1.5, 7.7)
   x 10(16) molecules cm (-2) C2H6. All gases were detected in larger 95\%
   of the spectra recorded in urban, semi-polluted rural and remote rural
   areas of the Colorado Front Range. We calculate structure functions
   based on VCDs, which describe the variability of a gas column over
   distance, and find the largest variability for NH3. The structure
   functions suggest that currently available satellites resolve about 10\%
   of the observed NH3 and NO2 VCD variability in the study area. We
   further quantify the trace gas emission fluxes of NH3 and C2H6 and
   production rates of NO2 from concentrated animal feeding operations
   (CAFO) using the mass balance method, i. e., the closed-loop vector
   integral of the VCD times wind speed along the drive track. Excellent
   reproducibility is found for NH3 fluxes and also, to a lesser extent,
   NO2 production rates on 2 consecutive days; for C2H6 the fluxes are
   affected by variable upwind conditions. Average emission factors were
   12.0 and 11.4 gNH3 h (-1) head (-1) at 30 degrees C for feedlots with a
   combined capacity for similar to 54 000 cattle and a dairy farm of
   similar to 7400 cattle; the pooled rate of 11.8 +/- 2.0 gNH(3) h (-1)
   head (-1) is compatible with the upper range of literature values. At
   this emission rate the NH3 source from cattle in Weld County, CO ( 535
   766 cattle), could be underestimated by a factor of 2-10. CAFO soils are
   found to be a significant source of NOx .The NOx source accounts for
   similar to 1.2\% of the N flux in NH3 and has the potential to add
   similar to 10\% to the overall NO x emissions in Weld County and double
   the NO x source in remote areas. This potential of CAFO to influence
   ambient NOx concentrations on the regional scale is relevant because O-3
   formation is NOx sensitive in the Colorado Front Range.

Abstract = {A ppb-level mid-infrared ethane (C2H6) sensor was developed using a
   continuous-wave, thermoelectrically cooled, distributed feedback
   interband cascade laser emitting at 3.34 mu m and a miniature dense
   patterned multipass gas cell with a 54.6-m optical path length. The
   performance of the sensor was investigated using two different
   techniques based on the tunable interband cascade laser: direct
   absorption spectroscopy (DAS) and second-harmonic wavelength modulation
   spectroscopy (2f-WMS). Three measurement schemes, DAS, WMS and
   quasi-simultaneous DAS and WMS, were realized based on the same optical
   sensor core. A detection limit of similar to 7.92 ppbv with a precision
   of +/-30 ppbv for the separate DAS scheme with an averaging time of 1 s
   and a detection limit of similar to 1.19 ppbv with a precision of about
   +/-4 ppbv for the separate WMS scheme with a 4-s averaging time were
   achieved. An Allan-Werle variance analysis indicated that the precisions
   can be further improved to 777 pptv @ 166 s for the separate DAS scheme
   and 269 pptv @ 108 s for the WMS scheme, respectively. For the
   quasi-simultaneous DAS and WMS scheme, both the 2f signal and the direct
   absorption signal were simultaneously extracted using a LabVIEW
   platform, and four C2H6 samples (0, 30, 60 and 90 ppbv with nitrogen as
   the balance gas) were used as the target gases to assess the sensor
   performance. A detailed comparison of the three measurement schemes is
   reported. Atmospheric C2H6 measurements on the Rice University campus
   and a field test at a compressed natural gas station in Houston, TX,
   were conducted to evaluate the performance of the sensor system as a
   robust and reliable field-deployable sensor system.},

Abstract = {The irradiation of pure ethane (C2H6/C2D6) ices at 5.5 K, under
   ultrahigh vacuum conditions was conducted to investigate the formation
   of complex hydrocarbons via interaction with energetic electrons
   simulating the secondary electrons produced in the track of galactic
   cosmic rays. The chemical modifications of the ices were monitored in
   situ using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and during
   temperature-programmed desorption via mass spectrometry exploiting a
   quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron impact ionization (EIQMS) as
   well as a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to a
   photoionization source (PI-ReTOFMS). FTIR confirmed previous ethane
   studies by detecting six molecules: methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2),
   ethylene (C2H4), the ethyl radical (C2H5), 1-butene (C4H8),and n-butane
   (C4H10). However, the TPD phase, along with EI-QMS, and most
   importantly, PI-ReTOF-MS, revealed the formation of at least 23
   hydrocarbons, many for the first time in ethane ice, which can be
   arranged in four groups with an increasing carbon-to-hydrogen ratio:
   CnH2n+2 (n = 3, 4, 6, 8, 10), CnH2n (n = 3-10), CnH2n-2(n = 3-10), and
   CnH2n-4(n = 4-6). The processing of simple ethane ices is relevant to
   the hydrocarbon chemistry in the interstellar medium, as ethane has been
   shown to be a major product of methane, as well as in the outer solar
   system. These data reveal that the processing of ethane ices can
   synthesize several key hydrocarbons such as C3H4 and C4H6 isomers, which
   have been found to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like
   indene (C9H8) and naphthalene (C10H8) in the ISM and in hydrocarbon-rich

Abstract = {The high resolution FTIR spectrum of ethane has been reinvestigated in
   the region near 3 mu m, where three perpendicular and one parallel
   infrared active bands are found.
   The main perpendicular band is v(4) + v(10). It is shown that the
   perpendicular partners of the combinations v(4) + 2v(8) and v(4) +
   2v(11) are coupled with each other in such a way that only one resultant
   mode can interact effectively with v(4) + v(10), becoming detectable by
   intensity stealing. The third perpendicular band is found to be the hot
   (2v(4) + v(10)) - v(4), lying at about 33 cm(-1) below the cold v(4) +
   v(10), because of the strong anharmonicity of the torsional mode v(4),
   and then well separated cold and hot transitions occur in this region.
   It is suggested that they could be exploited in the temperature
   monitoring in atmospheric and planetary spectra.
   The complexity and the irregular rotation-torsion structure makes an
   analysis of this perpendicular system not practicable, but a
   considerable body of new line assignments, especially for the hot
   transitions, have been found.
   We have been able to analyze the parallel band, in spite of the
   anomalous torsional structure, and some peculiar torsional effects show
   that the vibrational upper state must be the infrared active V-2 + V-9 +
   V-12(A(2u)).

   Space Observatory in the wavelength range from 5.3 to 7.0 mu m
   (1422-1890 cm(-1)). This spectral interval is of particular interest
   because it contains various molecular transitions, particularly the v(2)
   band of CH4 and the vs band of C2H6, as well as a spectral feature
   characteristic of the laboratory analogs of Titan's haze-or-tholins
   which have been studied for decades. In addition, this region is
   expected to show the transition between the thermal emission and
   reflected sunlight regimes of Titan's atmospheric radiation around 6 mu
   m. All these features are indeed observed in the SWS spectrum, for the
   first time in the case of the v(2) band of CH4 at 6.5 mu m. We present a
   radiative transfer model of these observations from which we derive the
   extinction cross section of the haze particles at 140 +/- 20 km

   available extinction cross section determinations for the Titan haze and
   those derived for laboratory-synthesized tholins, from the near- to the
   far-infrared, shows some similarities but also striking discrepancies,

   target two absorption lines, C2H6 at 2996.88 cm(-1) and CH4 at 2999.06

   single-gas detection by only targeting the absorption line of one gas
   species. Allan deviations of 11.2 parts per billion in volume (ppbv) for
   CH4 and 1.86 ppbv for C2H6 with an averaging time of 3.4 s were achieved
   for the detection of these two gases. Dual-gas detection was realized by
   using a long-term scan signal to target both CH4 and C2H6 lines. The
   Allan deviations increased slightly to 17.4 ppbv for CH4 and 2.4 ppbv
   for C2H6 with an averaging time of 4.6 s due to laser temperature and
   power drift caused by long-term wavelength scanning. Measurements for
   both indoor and outdoor concentration changes of CH4 and C2H6 were
   conducted. The reported single ICL based dual-gas sensor system has the
   advantages of reduced size and cost compared to two separate sensor systems.},

   to 984 transitions in the ground state and 422 transitions in the first

Abstract = {Atmospheric investigations rely heavily on the availability of accurate
   spectral information of hydrocarbons. To extend the ethane database we
   recorded a 0.0028 cm(-1) resolution spectrum of (C2H5D)-C-12 from 650 to
   1500 cm(-1) using a Bruker Fourier Transform spectrometer IFS-125HR at
   the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The 98\% deuterium-enriched sample was
   contained in a 0.2038 m absorption cell; one spectrum was obtained with
   the sample cryogenically cooled to 130.5 K and another at room
   temperature. From the cold data, we retrieved line positions and
   intensities of 8704 individual absorption features from 770 to 880
   cm(-1) using a least squares curve fitting algorithm. From this set of
   measurements, we assigned 5035 transitions to the v(17) fundamental at
   805.342729(27) cm(-1); this band is a c-type vibration, with
   often-resolved A and E components arising from internal rotation. The
   positions were modeled to a 22 term torsional Hamiltonian using SPFIT to
   fit the spectrum to a standard deviation of 7 x 10(-4) cm(-1) (21 MHz).
   The prediction of the 5035 line intensities at 130.5 K agreed with
   observed intensities, but a small centrifugal distortion type correction
   to the transition dipole was needed to model the intensity of high K-a R
   and P transitions. The integrated band intensities of 3.6628 x 10(-19)
   cm(-1)/(molecule cm(-2)) at 296 K in the 770-880 cm(-1) region was
   obtained. To predict line intensities at different temperatures, the
   partition function values were determined at nine temperatures between
   9.8 and 300 K by summing individual energy levels up to J = 99 and K-a =
   99 for the six states up through v(17) at 805 cm(-1). We found the
   energy of A and E are inverted as compared to ground state (with the E
   state lower than the A state) and the splitting, -241.8(10) MHz, lies
   between the ground state value of +74.167(18) MHz and the first
   torsional state (v(18) = 271.1 cm(-1)) value of -3382.23(34) MHz. The
   proximity of the energy splitting to the ground state suggests that the
   v(17) state has a similar torsional character. The resulting prediction
   of singly-deuterated ethane absorption at 12.51 mu m enables its
   detection in planetary atmospheres, including those of Titan and exoplanets.},

   The improved spectroscopic parameters include C2H6 pseudo-lines in the

   and ozone. These improved spectroscopic parameters allow for substantial
   reduction of the fitting residuals as well as enhanced information

   ungeophysical negative mixing ratio profiles. This strategy has been
   successfully applied to the Jungfraujoch solar spectra available from
   1994 onwards. The resulting time series is compared with C2H6 total
   columns simulated by the state-of-the-art chemical transport model

   increase of the C2H6 burden in the remote atmosphere above Jungfraujoch

   like terms. The fitting process involved five independent dipole

Title = {{Titan's atmosphere as observed by Cassini/VIMS solar occultations: CH4,
   CO and evidence for C2H6 absorption}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {248},
Pages = {1-24},
Abstract = {We present an analysis of the VIMS solar occultations dataset, which
   allows us to extract vertically resolved information on the
   characteristics of Titan's atmosphere between similar to 100 and 700 km
   with a vertical resolution of similar to 10 km. After a series of data
   treatment procedures to correct problems in pointing stability and
   parasitic light, 4 occultations out of 10 are retained. This sample
   covers different seasons and latitudes of Titan. The transmittances show
   clearly the evolution of the haze, with the detection of the detached
   layer at similar to 310 km in September 2011 at mid-northern latitudes.
   Through the inversion of the transmission spectra with a line-by-line
   radiative transfer code we retrieve the vertical distribution of CH4 and
   CO mixing ratio. For methane inversion we use its 1.4, 1.7 and 2.3 gm
   bands. The first two bands are always in good agreement and yield an
   average stratospheric abundance of 1.28 +/- 0.08\%, after correcting for
   forward-scattering effects, with no significant differences between the
   occultations. This is significantly less than the value of 1.48\%
   obtained by the GCMS/Huygens instrument. We find that the 2.3 gm band
   cannot be used for the extraction of methane abundance because it is
   blended with other absorptions, not included in our atmospheric model.
   The analysis of the residual spectra after the inversion shows that such
   additional absorptions are present through a great part of the VIMS
   wavelength range. We attribute many of these bands, including the one at
   2.3 mu m, to gaseous ethane, whose near infrared spectrum is not well
   modeled yet. Ethane also contributes significantly to the strong
   absorption at 3.2-3.5 mu m that was previously attributed only to C-H
   stretching bands from aerosols. Ethane bands may affect the surface
   windows too, especially at 2.7 mu m. Other residual bands are generated
   by stretching modes of C-H, C-C and C-N bonds. In addition to the C-H
   stretch from aliphatic hydrocarbons at 3.4 mu m, we detect a strong and
   narrow absorption at 3.28 mu m which we tentatively attribute to the
   presence of PAHs in the stratosphere. C-C and C-N stretching bands are
   possibly present between 4.3 and 4.5 mu m. Finally, we obtain the CO
   mixing ratio between 70 and 170 km, through the inversion of its 4.7 mu
   m band. The average result of 46 +/- 16 ppm is in good agreement with
   previous studies.},

   at 1473 cm-1 are analyzed for the first time. The transitions of v10 (an
   infrared inactive ``g{''} mode of the ethane) are observed through its
   resonant coupling with v9 (corresponding to a ``u{''} mode of normal
   ethane). Transitions of v(6) + v(11) are seen due to its strong coupling
   to v9. In general, torsional splitting produces two components (as in
   normal ethane), but in both v9 and v50, there is an additional small
   splitting of these components with degenerate torsional symmetry
   wherever the interacting v(10) levels become infrared active (from ``g

   resonances with AE = 2 and Ak = +1 are observed within v9 and between
   v(9) and v(10) while the strong interaction between v(9) and v(6) +
   v(11) plays a role in tuning pairs of levels into resonance. As in
   normal ethane, a detectable K-doubling occurs in the levels k= 2, e = 1
   of v(9), and the parallel band v4 shows an intensity bias, with the
   R-transitions markedly stronger than the P-transitions, due to its
   x,y-Coriolis coupling with v9. The spectrum is analyzed by adopting an
   appropriate Hamiltonian model, and vibration-rotation-torsion parameters
   of the four mentioned vibrational states are determined by the least
   squares process using 1350 observed transition line positions (RMS
   deviation 3.24 x 10-3 cm-I). The values of rotational and torsional

Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2014},

Abstract = {Imaging and spectroscopy of Neptune's thermal infrared emission from
   Keck/LWS (2003), Gemini-N/MICHELLE (2005); VLT/VISIR (2006) and
   Gemini-S/TReCS (2007) is used to assess seasonal changes in Neptune's
   zonal mean temperatures between Voyager-2 observations (1989,
   heliocentric longitude L-s = 236 degrees) and southern summer solstice
   (2005, L-s = 270 degrees). Our aim was to analyse imaging and
   spectroscopy from multiple different sources using a single
   self-consistent radiative-transfer model to assess the magnitude of
   seasonal variability. Globally-averaged stratospheric temperatures
   measured from methane emission tend towards a quasi-isothermal structure
   (158-164 K) above the 0.1-mbar level, and are found to be consistent
   with spacecraft observations of AKARI. This remarkable consistency,
   despite very different observing conditions, suggests that stratospheric
   temporal variability, if present, is <+/- 5 K at 1 mbar and <+/- 3 K at
   0.1 mbar during this solstice period. Conversely, ethane emission is
   highly variable, with abundance determinations varying by more than a
   factor of two (from 500 to 1200 ppb at 1 mbar). The retrieved C2H6
   abundances are extremely sensitive to the details of the T(p)
   derivation, although the underlying cause of the variable ethane
   emission remains unidentified. Stratospheric temperatures and ethane are
   found to be latitudinally uniform away from the south pole (assuming a
   latitudinally-uniform distribution of stratospheric methane), with no
   large seasonal hemispheric asymmetries evident at solstice. At low and
   mid-latitudes, comparisons of synthetic Voyager-era images with
   solstice-era observations suggest that tropospheric zonal temperatures
   are unchanged since the Voyager 2 encounter, with cool mid-latitudes and
   a warm equator and pole. A re-analysis of Voyager/IRIS 25-50 mu m
   mapping of tropospheric temperatures and para-hydrogen disequilibrium (a
   tracer for vertical motions) suggests a symmetric meridional circulation
   with cold air rising at mid-latitudes (sub-equilibrium para-H-2
   conditions) and warm air sinking at the equator and poles
   (super-equilibrium para-H-2 conditions). The most significant
   atmospheric changes have occurred at high southern latitudes, where
   zonal temperatures retrieved from 2003 images suggest a polar
   enhancement of 7-8 K above the tropopause, and an increase of 5-6 K
   throughout the 70-90 degrees S region between 0.1 and 200 mbar. Such a
   large perturbation, if present in 1989, would have been detectable by
   Voyager/IRIS in a single scan despite its long-wavelength sensitivity,
   and we conclude that Neptune's south polar cyclonic vortex increased in
   strength significantly from Voyager to solstice.},

   Uranus at the time of the 2007 equinox. For vertically uniform eddy
   diffusion coefficients in the range 2200-2600 cm(2) s(-1), photochemical
   models that reproduce the observed methane emission also predict C2H6
   profiles that compare well with emission in the 11.6-12.5 mu m
   wavelength region, where the upsilon(9) band of C2H6 is prominent. Our
   nominal model with a uniform eddy diffusion coefficient K-zz = 2430
   cm(2) s(-1) and a CH4 tropopause mole fraction of 1.6 x 10(-5) provides
   a good fit to other hydrocarbon emission features, such as those of C2H2
   and C4H2, but the model profile for CH3C2H must be scaled by a factor of
   0.43, suggesting that improvements are needed in the chemical reaction
   mechanism for C3Hx species. The nominal model is consistent with a
   CH3D/CH4 ratio of 3.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(-4). From the best-fit scaling of
   these photochemical-model profiles, we derive column abundances above
   the 10-mbar level of 4.5 + 01.1/-0.8 x 10(9) molecule-cm(-2) for CH4,
   6.2 +/- 1.0 x 10(16) molecule-cm(-2) for C2H2 (with a value 24\% higher
   from a different longitudinal sampling), 3.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(16)
   molecule-cm(-2) for C2H6, 8.6 +/- 2.6 x 10(13) molecule-cm(-2) for
   CH3C2H, 1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(13) molecule-cm(-2) for C4H2, and 1.7 +/- 0.4 x
   10(13) molecule-cm(-2) for CO2 on Uranus. A model with K-zz increasing
   with altitude fits the observed spectrum and requires CH4 and C2H6
   column abundances that are 54\% and 45\% higher than their respective
   values in the nominal model, but the other hydrocarbons and CO2 are
   within 14\% of their values in the nominal model. Systematic
   uncertainties arising from errors in the temperature profile are
   estimated very conservatively by assuming an unrealistic
   ``alternative{''} temperature profile that is nonetheless consistent
   with the observations; for this profile the column abundance of CH4 is
   over four times higher than in the nominal model, but the column
   abundances of the hydrocarbons and CO2 differ from their value in the
   nominal model by less than 22\%. The CH3D/CH4 ratio is the same in both
   the nominal model with its uniform K-zz as in the vertically variable
   K-zz model, and it is 10\% lower with the ``alternative{''} temperature
   profile than the nominal model. There is no compelling evidence for
   temporal variations in global-average hydrocarbon abundances over the
   decade between Infrared Space Observatory and Spitzer observations, but
   we cannot preclude a possible large increase in the C2H2 abundance since
   the Voyager era.
   Our results have implications with respect to the influx rate of
   exogenic oxygen species and the production rate of stratospheric hazes
   on Uranus, as well as the C4H2 vapor pressure over C4H2 ice at low temperatures.},

   CH3OH. Our production rate for H2O (3.885 +/- 0.074 x 10(28) molecules
   s(-1)) was consistent with that measured during other apparitions of
   21P/GZ as retrieved from optical, infrared, and radio observations. Our
   analysis also provided values for rotational temperature (T-rot = 51 +/-
   3 K) and the abundance ratio of ortho and para spin populations for
   water (OPR = 2.99 +/- 0.23, implying a spin temperature exceeding 50 K).
   Six Q-branches in the nu(7) band of C2H6 provided a production rate
   (5.27 +/- 0.90 x 10(25) s(-1)) that corresponded to an abundance ratio
   of 0.136 +/- 0.023 x 10(-2) relative to H2O, confirming the previously
   reported strong depletion of C2H6 from IR observations during the 1998
   apparition, and in qualitative agreement with the depletion of C-2 known
   from optical studies of 21P/GZ. For CH3OH, we applied our recently
   published quantum model for the nu(3) band to obtain a rotational
   temperature (48(+10)/-7 K) consistent with that obtained for H2O. In
   addition, we developed a new empirical model for the CH3OH nu(2) band,
   based on observations of Comet 8P/Tuttle with NIRSPEC. The application
   of our nu(2) model to 21P/GZ yielded a production rate in agreement with
   that obtained from the nu(3) band. Combining results from both nu(2) and
   nu(3) bands provided a production rate (47.5 +/- 4.4 x 10(25) s(-1))
   that corresponded to an abundance ratio of 1.22 +/- 0.11 x 10(-2)
   relative to H2O in 21P/GZ, indicating mild depletion of CH3OH. Together
   with observations of 21P/GZ in 1998, our study provides a measure of
   primary volatile production rates for this Jupiter family comet over
   multiple apparitions using high-resolution IR spectroscopy.},

   thermal structures at -20 mbar. The globally averaged CH4 heating and
   cooling rates are not balanced, clearly in the lower stratosphere under
   10 mbar, and possibly in the upper stratosphere above the 1 mbar
   pressure level. Possible heating sources from the gravity wave breaking
   and aerosols are discussed. The radiative relaxation timescale in the
   lower stratosphere implies that the temperature profile might not be

Abstract = {We obtained high-resolution (lambda/Delta lambda similar to 28,000)
   infrared spectra of Comet 103P/Hartley 2 on UT 2010 November 4.6 using
   the NIRSPEC spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory. Here we present
   spectra of Hartley 2 between 2.832 and 3.639 mu m (3531-2748 cm(-1)),
   representing the most complete high-resolution infrared survey of a
   Jupiter-family comet to date in this wavelength region. We have
   tabulated rest frequencies, line fluxes, line signal-to-noise ratios and
   line widths for all detected emissions. Fluorescence models, published
   line lists and laboratory spectra were used to obtain molecular
   assignments for detected emissions. Multiple lines of the following
   species were detected in Hartley 2: H2O, OH, CH3OH, C2H6, HCN, C2H2,
   H2CO, NH3 and NH2. All identified species seen in this survey have been
   previously detected in comets. There were 364 distinct emission features
   present in these spectra, of which 36 were unidentified. We compare the
   spectrum of Hartley 2 to chemically different Jupiter-family Comets
   73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3-B and 17P/Holmes in order to obtain
   additional information on the characteristics of unknown lines through
   the comparison of relative line fluxes for corresponding emissions in
   these comets. For the strongest unidentified emissions, additional
   information was also obtained through a comparison of their spatial
   distributions in the coma to that of known emission features in Hartley
   2. This spectral survey of Hartley 2 provides detailed information about
   its overall volatile chemistry, provides a comparison to past and future
   high-resolution infrared datasets, and further characterizes the most
   promising spectral regions for future molecular searches in comets.},

   stratospheric temperatures, winds and composition at mbar pressures that
   persisted long after the tropospheric disturbance had abated. Thermal
   infrared (IR) spectroscopy from the Cassini Composite Infrared
   Spectrometer (CIRS), supported by ground-based IR imaging from the VISIR
   instrument on the Very Large Telescope and the MIRSI instrument on
   NASA's IRTF, is used to track the evolution of a large, hot
   stratospheric anticyclone between January 2011 and March 2012. The
   evolutionary sequence can be divided into three phases: (I) the
   formation and intensification of two distinct warm airmasses near 0.5
   mbar between 25 and 35 degrees N (B1 and B2) between January-April 2011,
   moving westward with different zonal velocities, B1 residing directly
   above the convective tropospheric storm head; (II) the merging of the
   warm airmasses to form the large single `stratospheric beacon' near 40
   degrees N (BO) between April and June 2011, disassociated from the storm
   head and at a higher pressure (2 mbar) than the original beacons, a
   downward shift of 1.4 scale heights (approximately 85 km) post-merger;
   and (III) the mature phase characterised by slow cooling (0.11 +/- 0.01
   K/day) and longitudinal shrinkage of the anticyclone since July 2011.
   Peak temperatures of 221.6 +/- 1.4 K at 2 mbar were measured on May 5th
   2011 immediately after the merger, some 80 K warmer than the quiescent
   surroundings. From July 2011 to the time of writing, BO remained as a
   long-lived stable stratospheric phenomenon at 2 mbar, moving west with a
   near-constant velocity of 2.70 +/- 0.04 deg/day (-24.5 +/- 0.4 m/s at 40
   degrees N relative to System III longitudes). No perturbations to
   visible clouds and hazes were detected during this period.
   With no direct tracers of motion in the stratosphere, we use thermal
   windshear calculations to estimate clockwise peripheral velocities of
   200-400 m/s at 2 mbar around BO. The peripheral velocities of the two
   original airmasses were smaller (70-140 m/s). In August 2011, the size
   of the vortex as defined by the peripheral collar was 65 degrees
   longitude (50,000 km in diameter) and 25 degrees latitude. Stratospheric
   acetylene (C2H2) was uniformly enhanced by a factor of three within the
   vortex, whereas ethane (C2H6) remained unaffected. The passage of BO
   generated a new band of warm stratospheric emission at 0.5 mbar at its
   northern edge, and there are hints of warm stratospheric structures
   associated with the beacons at higher altitudes (p < 0.1 mbar) than can
   be reliably observed by CIRS nadir spectroscopy. Analysis of the zonal
   windshear suggests that Rossby wave perturbations from the convective
   storm could have propagated vertically into the stratosphere at this
   point in Saturn's seasonal cycle, one possible source of energy for the
   formation of these stratospheric anticyclones.},

   C2H6 nu(5) and C2H6 nu(7). As a symmetric hydrocarbon, C2H6 is observed

Abstract = {Ethane and other hydrocarbon gases have strong rovibrational transitions
   in the 3.3 mu m spectral region owing to C-H, CH2, and CH3 vibrational
   modes, making this spectral region prime for searching possible
   biomarker gases in extraterrestrial atmospheres (e. g., Mars,
   exoplanets) and organic molecules in comets. However, removing ethane
   spectral signatures from high-resolution terrestrial transmittance
   spectra has been imperfect because existing quantum mechanical models
   have been unable to reproduce the observed spectra with sufficient
   accuracy. To redress this problem, we constructed a line-by-line model
   for the nu(7) band of ethane (C2H6) and applied it to compute telluric
   transmittances and cometary fluorescence efficiencies. Our model
   considers accurate spectral parameters, vibration-rotation interactions,
   and a functional characterization of the torsional hot band. We
   integrated the new band model into an advanced radiative transfer code
   for synthesizing the terrestrial atmosphere (LBLRTM), achieving
   excellent agreement with transmittance data recorded against Mars using
   three different instruments located in the Northern and Southern
   hemispheres. The retrieved ethane abundances demonstrate the strong
   hemispheric asymmetry noted in prior surveys of volatile hydrocarbons.
   We also retrieved sensitive limits for the abundance of ethane on Mars.
   The most critical validation of the model was obtained by comparing
   simulations of C2H6 fluorescent emission with spectra of three
   hydrocarbon-rich comets: C/2004 Q2 (Machholz), 8P/Tuttle, and C/2007W1
   (Boattini). The new model accurately describes the complex emission
   morphology of the nu(7) band at low rotational temperatures and greatly
   increases the confidence of the retrieved production rates (and
   rotational temperatures) with respect to previously available fluorescence models.},

Abstract = {The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of ethane between 2860 and 3060
   cm(-1) has been re-investigated under high resolution at 229 K. The
   infrared absorption in this region is due mainly to the CH stretching
   fundamentals vs (parallel band) and nu(7) (degenerate perpendicular
   band), and to the parallel combination system nu(8) + nu(11) (A(4s),
   A(3s)). All the relevant perturbation mechanisms affecting the observed
   absorption patterns have been clarified. In particular, the main
   perturbers of the nu(7) state are identified to be the degenerate
   vibrational combination states nu(8) + nu(11) (l-type interaction) and
   nu(3) + 2 nu(4) + nu(8) (Fermi-type interaction). Because of the last
   interaction, the K `'Delta K = -6 transitions occur with intensities
   comparable to both the infrared active fundamental nu(7) and the almost
   dark combination nu(3) + 2 nu(4) + nu(8). The parallel combination
   system nu(8) + nu(11) (A(4s), A(3s)) is overlapped and heavily perturbed
   by the nearby parallel system nu(4) + nu(11) + nu(12) (A(4s), A(3s)).
   whose K-structure is spread by the strong z-Coriolis interaction of its
   two vibrational components. In this work, 95 new transitions to the
   perturbers of nu(7) have been assigned. They belong mostly to the
   degenerate vibrational states nu(8) + nu(11) (E-1d) and nu(3)+ 2 nu(4) +
   nu(8) (E-1d), and to the parallel system nu(8) + nu(11) (A(4s), A(3s)).
   A least squares fit calculation, limited to the nu(7) degenerate

   database containing the molecular parameters for 4969 transitions in
   these five bands of (C2H6)-C-12. Finally, we identified the degenerate
   combination band nu(2) + nu(8) (62 observed transitions) to be the main

   microwindows compared with those for previous versions of ACE data. With
   the improved ethyne retrieval we have been able to produce a near global
   upper tropospheric distribution of C2H2 from space. Carbon monoxide,
   ethane and ethyne concentrations retrieved using ACE spectra show the
   expected seasonality linked to variations in the anthropogenic emissions
   and destruction rates as well as seasonal biomass burning activity. The
   GEOS-Chem model was run using the dicarbonyl chemistry suite, an
   extended chemical mechanism in which ethyne is treated explicitly.
   Seasonal cycles observed from satellite data are well reproduced by the
   model output, however the simulated CO concentrations are found to be
   systematically biased low over the Northern Hemisphere. An average
   negative global mean bias of 12\% and 7\% of the model relative to the
   satellite observations has been found for CO and C2H6 respectively and a
   positive global mean bias of 1\% has been found for C2H2. ACE data are
   compared for validation purposes with MkIV spectrometer data and Global

Abstract = {Using TEXES, the Texas Echelon cross Echelle Spectrograph, mounted on
   the Gemini North 8-m telescope we have mapped the spatial variation of
   H-2, CH4, C2H2 and C2H6 thermal-infrared emission of Neptune. These
   high-spectral-resolution, spatially resolved, thermal-infrared
   observations of Neptune offer a unique glimpse into the state of
   Neptune's stratosphere in October 2007, L-S = 275.4 degrees just past
   Neptune's southern summer solstice (L-S = 270 degrees). We use
   observations of the S(1) pure rotational line of molecular hydrogen and
   a portion of the v(4) band of methane to retrieve detailed information
   on Neptune's stratospheric vertical and meridional thermal structure. We
   find global-average temperatures of 163.8 +/- 0.8, 155.0 +/- 0.9, and
   123.8 +/- 0.8 K at the 7.0 x 10(-3)-, 0.12-, and 2.1-mbar levels with no
   meridional variations within the errors. We then use the inferred
   temperatures to model the emission of C2H2 and C2H6 in order to derive
   stratospheric volume mixing ratios (hence forth, VMR) as a function of
   pressure and latitude. There is a subtle meridional variation of the
   C2H2 VMR at the 0.5-mbar level with the peak abundance found at 28
   latitude, falling off to the north and south. However, the observations
   are consistent within error to a meridionally constant C2H2 VMR of
   3.3(-0.9)(+1.2) x 10(-8) at 0.5 mbar. We find that the VMR of C2H6 at
   1-mbar peaks at the equator and falls by a factor of 1.6 at -70 degrees
   latitude. However, a meridionally constant VMR of 9.3(-2.6)(+3.5) x
   10(-7) at the 1-mbar level for C2H6 is also statistically consistent
   with the retrievals. Temperature predictions from a radiative-seasonal
   climate model of Neptune that assumes the hydrocarbon abundances
   inferred in this paper are lower than the measured temperatures by 40K
   at 7 x 10(-3) mbar, 30 K at 0.12 mbar and 25 K at 2.1 mbar. The
   radiative-seasonal model also predicts meridional temperature variations
   on the order of 10 K from equator to pole, which are not observed.
   Assuming higher stratospheric CH4 abundance at the equator relative to
   the south pole would bring the meridional trends of the inferred
   temperatures and radiative-seasonal model into closer agreement.
   We have also retrieved observations of C2H4 emission from Neptune's
   stratosphere using TEXES on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF)
   in June 2003, L-S = 266 degrees. Using the observations from the middle
   of the planet and an average of the middle three latitude temperature
   profiles from the 2007 observations (9.5 degrees of L-S later, the
   seasonal equivalent of 9.5 Earth days within Earth's seasonal cycle), we
   infer a C2H4 VMR of 5.9(-0.8)(+1.0) x 10(-7) at 1.5 x 10(-3) mbar, a
   value that is 3.25 times that predicted by global-average photochemical models.},

   meridional temperature gradient at 1-2 hPa as in recent previous studies

   Icarus 190, 556-572]. We then retrieve the vertical profiles of C2H6 and
   C2H2 from 3 to 0.01 hPa and of C3H8 around 1 hPa. At 1 hPa, the
   meridional variation of C2H2 is found to follow the yearly averaged
   solar insolation, except for a strong equatorial mole fraction of 8 x
   10(-7), nearly two times higher than expected. This enhancement in
   abundance can be explained by the descent of hydrocarbon-rich air, with
   a vertical wind speed at the equator of 0.25 +/- 0.1 mm/s at 1 hPa and
   0.4 +/- 0.15 mm/s at 0.1 hPa. The ethane distribution is relatively
   uniform at 1 hPa, with only a moderate 25\% increase from 35 degrees S
   to 80 degrees S. Propane is found to increase from north to south by a
   factor of 1.9, suggesting that its lifetime may be shorter than Saturn's
   year at 1 hPa. At high altitudes (1 Pa), C2H2 and C2H6 abundances depart
   significantly from the photochemical model predictions of Moses and
   Greathouse {[}Moses, J.I., Greathouse, T.K., 2005. J. Geophys. Res. 110,

Abstract = {Hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Saturn are known, from Voyager,
   ground-based, and early Cassini results, to vary in emission intensity
   with latitude. Of particular interest is the marked increase in
   hydrocarbon line intensity near the south pole during southern summer,
   as the increased line intensity cannot be simply explained by the
   increased temperatures observed in that region since the variations
   between C2H2 and C2H6 emission in the south pole region are different.
   In order to measure the latitudinal variations of hydrocarbons in
   Saturn's southern hemisphere we have used 3 cm(-1) resolution Cassini
   CIRS data from 2006 and combined this with measurements from the ground
   in October 2006 at NASA's IRTF using Celeste, an infrared
   high-resolution cryogenic grating spectrometer. These two data sets have
   been used to infer the molecular abundances Of C2H2 and C2H6 across the
   southern hemisphere in the 1-10 mbar altitude region. We find that the
   latitudinal acetylene profile follows the yearly average mean daily
   insolation except at the southern pole where it peaks in abundance. Near
   the equator (5 degrees S) the C2H2 abundance at the 1.2 mbar level is
   (1.6 +/- 0.19) x 10(-7) and it decreases by a factor of 2.7 from the

Abstract = {We have reanalyzed the high-resolution spectrum of Titan between 2.87
   and 3.12 mu m observed with NIRSPEC/Keck II on 2001 Nov. 21 in southern
   summer, using updated CH3D and C2H6 line-by-line models. From new
   synthetic spectra, we identify all but a few of the previously
   unidentified significant absorption spectral features in this wavelength
   range as due to these two species, both of which had been previously
   detected by Voyager and ground-based observations at other wavelengths.
   We also derive opacities and reflectivities of haze particles as
   functions of altitude for the 2.87-2.92 mu m wavelength range, where
   Titan's atmosphere is partially transparent down to the surface. The
   extinction per unit altitude is observed to increase from 100 km
   (similar to 8 mbar) toward lower altitude. The derived total optical
   depth is approximately 1.1 for the 2.97-2.92 mu m range. At wavelengths
   increasing beyond 2.92 mu m the haze layers become much more optically
   thick, and the surface is rapidly hidden from view. These conclusions
   apply to equatorial and southern-temperate regions on Titan, excluding
   polar regions. We also find it unlikely that there is a large
   enhancement of the tropospheric CH4 mole fraction over the Value
   reported from analysis of the Huygens/GCMS observations.},

   which had hindered a global analysis of this region until now, is caused
   by a network of l-type resonances acting within the Fermi (or
   torsional-Coriolis) coupled system nu(8), nu(4) + nu(12). The
   x,y-Coriolis interaction between nu(6) and nu(8) and vibration-rotation

   deviation better than 3.8 X 10(-3) cm(-1). The determined values of the
   intrinsic torsional splittings in the different vibrational states are
   in agreement with the theoretical expectations. The intrinsic torsional
   splitting almost vanishes in nu(8), as in digermane and disilane; it is
   slightly larger in nu(4) + nu(12) than in nu(4), due to the decrease of
   the torsional barrier height with the excitation of nu(12). For the 2
   nu(4) + nu(9) state, the determined values of the vibrational origin and
   torsional splittings are in good agreement with the large increase of
   the torsional barrier height expected with the excitation of the nu(9)

   Several hot transitions originating from the v(4) = 1 torsional state
   have been observed. An analysis of 294 line positions belonging to the

Journal = JQSRT,

Pages = {1081-1097},
Abstract = {We describe a technique for analysis of high resolution thermal IR
   spectra measured with a finite beam (field of view) on the target
   planetary atmosphere. The model developed allows a beam integrated
   radiative transfer calculation over the varying line-of-sight velocity,
   temperature, and species abundance distributed over the field of view,
   thus recovering information on atmospheric composition, dynamics, and
   thermal structure. The modeling procedure is comprises four primary
   aspects: segmentation of the projected observational beam to a grid of
   beam elements; determining the geometrical properties of the planetary
   atmospheric region associated with each beam element; calculating the
   spectrum emergent from the top of the atmosphere of each element; and
   weighting the ensemble of spectra with the characteristic observational
   beam response profile and accumulating the contributions. This
   prescription results in a beam integrated spectrum-a more accurate
   representation of fully resolved IR rotation-vibration molecular spectra
   of planetary atmospheres observed with finite aperture telescopes. The
   method is implemented as a numerical code appropriate for modeling the
   spectroscopic observations. This paper describes the basic formalism for
   beam integrated radiation transfer of planetary atmospheres, discusses
   the salient points of the modeling process, and quantifies limitations.
   Application of this technique will be illustrated using high resolution
   atmospheric molecular spectral line measurements of Titan obtained by
   infrared heterodyne spectroscopy to extract zonal wind field,
   temperature and C2H6 abundance.},

   crucial for correct interpretation of recent Cassini observations of
   ethane spectra in the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan, as well as of
   Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS)
   observations in the terrestrial atmosphere. Using a spectrum of the v(9)

Abstract = {Hydrocarbons such as acetylene (C2H2) and ethane (C2H6) are important
   tracers in Jupiter's atmosphere, constraining our models of the chemical
   and dynamical processes. However, our knowledge of the vertical and
   meridional variations of their abundances has remained sparse. During
   the flyby of the Cassim spacecraft in December 2000, the Composite
   Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument was used to map the spatial
   variation of ennssions from 10 to 1400 cm(-1) (1000-7 mu m). In this
   paper we analyze a zonally averaged set of CIRS spectra taken at the
   highest (0.48 cm(-1)) resolution, firstly to infer atmospheric
   temperatures in the stratosphere at 0.5-20 mbar via the v(4) band of
   CH4, and in the troposphere at 150-400 mbar. via the H-2 absorption at
   600-800 cm(-1). Stratospheric temperatures at 5 mbar are generally
   warmer in the north than the south by 7-8 K. while tropospheric
   temperatures show no such asymmetry. Both latitudinal temperature
   profiles however do show a pattern of maxima and minima which are
   largely anti-correlated between the two levels. We then use the derived
   temperature profiles to infer the vertical abundances of C2H2) and C2H6
   by modeling tropospheric absorption (similar to 200 mbar) and
   stratospheric emission (similar to 5 mbar) in the C2H2 V-5 and C2H6 v(9)
   bands, and also emission of the acetylene (v(4) + v(5)) - v(4) hotband
   (similar to 0.1 mbar). Acetylene shows a distinct north-south asymmetry
   in the stratosphere, with 5 mbar abundances greatest close to 20 degrees
   N and decreasing from there towards both poles by a factor of similar to
   4. At 200 mbar in contrast, acetylene is nearly flat at a level of
   similar to 3 x 10(-9). Additionally, the abundance gradient Of C2H2
   between 10 and 0.1 mbar is derived, based on interpolated temperatures
   at 0.1 mbar, and is found to be positive and uniform with latitude to
   within errors. Ethane at both 5 and 200 mbar shows increasing VMR
   towards polar regions of similar to 1.75 towards 70 degrees N and
   similar to 2.0 towards 70 degrees S. An explanation for the meridional
   trends is proposed in terms of a combination of photochemistry and
   dynamics. Poleward, the decreasing UV flux is predicted to decrease the
   abundances Of C2H2 and C2H6 by factors of 2.7 and 3.5, respectively, at
   latitude 70 degrees. However, the lifetime Of C2H6 in the stratosphere
   (3 x 10(10) s at 5 mbar) is much longer than the dynamical timescale for
   meridional mixing inferred from Comet SL-9 debris (5-50 x 10(8) s), and
   therefore the rising abundance towards high latitudes likely indicates
   that meridional mixing dominates over photochemical effects. For C2H2,
   the opposite occurs, with the relatively short photochemical lifetime Q
   x 10(7) s), compared to meridional mixing times, ensuring that the
   expected photochemical trends are visible.},

Abstract = {Internal rotation in C2H6 and CH3SiH3 and similar symmetric tops has
   been investigated from 50 kHz to 1000 cm(-1) using high resolution
   rotational, torsional, vibrational, and molecular beam spectroscopy.
   Electric dipole transitions that are forbidden in first order have been
   measured at high sensitivity with a Fourier transform microwave cavity
   spectrometer and infrared interferometers. The molecular beam avoided
   crossing technique has been developed to detect transitions that break
   the standard rotation-torsion-nuclear spin selection rules. The
   torsional mode has been studied from the harmonic limit to the case of
   nearly free internal rotation. Intensity and Stark shift measurements
   have been carried out in an investigation of the torsional dependence of
   the electric dipole operator. Fragmentation of the lowest lying parallel
   and perpendicular vibrational bands has been observed due to resonant
   and non-resonant interactions with dark states that differ from the
   bright states by as many as five torsional quanta. Giant torsional
   splittings are observed reflecting the fact that the frequency of
   tunneling through the hindering potential has been increased by more
   than a factor of ten. The results have serious implications for methyl
   enhancement of intramolecular vibrational relaxation. An effective
   Hamiltonian has been developed showing that the fragmentation is caused
   by Coriolis and anharmonic interactions mediated by the large amplitude
   motion. For each molecule studied, a multi-band fit to a large global
   data set has been made to within experimental error. The isotopic
   dependence of the torsional parameters for C2H6, CH3CD3, and C2D6 is
   discussed. This Work is reviewed and possible future directions suggested.},

   features formed in the stratosphere of Titan was collected on disc
   center at 11.74 mu m wavelength (851 cm(-1)) on 15 January 2005 UT. The
   observations were obtained at the Subaru 8.2 m telescope of the National
   Astronomical Observatory of Japan on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, using the NASA
   Goddard Space Flight Center Heterodyne Instrument for Planetary Winds
   and Composition (HIPWAC). Fully resolved rotational-vibrational
   transitions of C2H6 were measured with resolving power lambda/Delta
   lambda >= 10(6) by infrared heterodyne spectroscopy (IRHS). The spectrum
   is reproduced most effectively by vertical profiles of ethane abundance
   that are uniform through the stratosphere and enhanced within the
   mesosphere. Profiles in which there is a significant gradient within the
   stratosphere are not favored. The retrieved stratospheric ethane mole
   fraction depends weakly on the form invoked for the mesospheric
   enhancement. Two forms of the ethane mole fraction profile are found to
   reproduce the observed spectrum effectively: the best fitting results
   are obtained with a profile in which the mesospheric ethane
   concentration increases logarithmically versus decreasing pressure,
   retrieving a stratospheric ethane concentration of 8.2 +/- 2.1 x 10(-6)
   (1 sigma), increasing proportional to p(-1.2) from the stratopause
   through the mesosphere ( p is pressure). A second form of profile, in
   which the mesospheric ethane concentration is enhanced uniformly by a
   factor of 9.5, retrieves a stratospheric concentration of 9.7 +/- 4.9 x
   10(-6) (1 sigma), with the enhancement discontinuity at about one scale
   height above the stratopause. The retrieved stratospheric mole fraction
   is consistent with earlier retrievals from IRHS and is somewhat less
   than contemporaneous retrievals from infrared spectroscopy at lower
   resolution by the Cassini spacecraft. The retrieved mesospheric
   concentration is consistent with in situ measurements in Titan's
   thermosphere made by the Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer
   instrument during the Titan flyby ( Waite et al., 2005).},

Abstract = {The v(9) fundamental band of ethane occurs in the 12 pm region. It is
   the strongest band of ethane in a terrestrial window and is commonly
   used for the identification of ethane in the Jovian planets. The v(9) +
   v(4) - v(4) band occurs in the same region; neither can be analysed as
   an isolated band, since both are embedded in the torsional bath of the
   ground vibrational state. We report here two global fit models including
   data from both of these bands as well as the v(3) fundamental and the
   v(4), 2v(4) - v(4), and 3v(4) torsional transitions. The first is
   restricted to -5 <= K Delta K <= 15 in the hot band and gives an
   excellent fit to the included data. Three resonant interactions are
   identified in this fit-a Coriolis interaction with two resonant cases
   between the v9 torsional stack and that of the ground vibrational state
   (gs) and a resonant Fermi interaction between the v3 fundamental and the
   gs. Hot band lines with KAK < -5 are influenced by a fourth
   perturbation, with a crossing at -11 <= K Delta K <= -10, which has been
   attributed to an interaction with the v(12) fundamental. A second fit,
   demonstrating a promising treatment of this interaction, is also presented.},

   few K-branches of the hot band associated with nu(9)+nu(12)(E),

   and analysed. These observations give information on the effects of the
   v(12) = 1 vibrational state, not directly accessible in the infrared, on
   the molecular internal rotation. From the vibrational frequencies of
   nu(9)+nu(12)(E) and its related hot band, determined in this work, and
   those of nu(9) and its hot band determined previously, we can determine
   that the torsional barrier height changes by -19.25 cm(-1) if the nu(12)
   mode is excited by one quantum. This causes the torsional splitting to
   increase by about 0.0038 cm(-1). The observed torsional splitting in the
   nu(6)+nu(12) vibrational state is larger than in the ground vibrational
   state by 0.0024 cm(-1), with a 0.0033 cm(-1) change caused by the
   lowering of the barrier height and a -0.0009 cm(-1) change caused by the
   head tail and torsional Coriolis mechanisms. The torsional splitting
   observed in the nu(9)+nu(12)(E) state, -0.0043 cm(-1), is inverted with
   respect to the ground vibrational state (0.0150 cm(-1) in the lowest

   the E-1d vibrational symmetry description. The analysis of perturbations
   observed in the rotation torsion structure of nu(9)+nu(12)(E) yields
   information on the vibrational states nu(2)+nu(4) and nu(4)+nu(11), and

Abstract = {We report observation and analysis of a high-resolution 2.87-3.54 mu m

   particles. The v(2) + v(3) band of CH3D is detected in absorption
   between 2.87 and 2.92 mu m; and we derived from it a mixing ratio
   approximately consistent with the Infrared Space Observatory result. The
   v(3) band of C2H2 also is detected in absorption between 2.95 and 3.05
   mu m; analysis indicates a sudden drop in the C2H2 mixing ratio at 15
   mbar (130 km above the 1 bar level), probably due to condensation in the
   low stratosphere. The presence of the v(3) + v(9) + v(11) band of C2H6

   9 +/- 4 x 10(-6) for this species. Most of the C2H6 3.3 mu m line
   emission arises in the altitude range 460-620 km (at similar to mu bar
   pressure levels), much higher than the 160-370 km range where the 12 mu
   m thermal molecular line emission of this species arises. At 2.87-2.90
   mu m the major absorber is tropospheric PH3. The cloud level determined

   about 125 km (similar to 12 mbar level) on the 3.20-3.54 mu m spectrum,

   computing the formation of C-2 and C-3 from C2H2, C2H6, and C3H4 as
   their parent molecules. The required photodissociation rates of C3H2 and

   rates for C2H2, C2H6, and C3H4, abundance ratios are obtained for
   heliocentric distances r(h) >= 3 AU. In comet Hale-Bopp, C2H2 and C2H6

Journal = JGRP,

Abstract = {The variation of hydrocarbon abundances with altitude, latitude, and
   season in Saturn's stratosphere is investigated using a one-dimensional,
   time-variable, photochemical model. The results indicate that
   hydrocarbon abundances at pressures less than similar to 0.01 mbar are
   extremely sensitive to solar flux variations due to changes in season,
   latitude, orbital radius, solar cycle, and ring shadowing. Long vertical
   diffusion times in the 0.01-1 mbar region introduce phase lags in the
   response to insolation changes. At pressures greater than 1 mbar,
   vertical diffusion timescales are longer than a Saturnian year.
   Therefore, relatively long-lived hydrocarbons like C2H2, C2H6, and C3H8
   exhibit little seasonal variation in the lower stratosphere, and the
   yearly averaged solar insolation combined with vertical diffusion
   control species abundances in this region. Species with short
   photochemical lifetimes (e.g., CH3, C2H4) continue to experience
   seasonal variations, even at low altitudes. The model results are
   compared with infrared observations from the TEXES spectrometer at
   NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that the observed C2H2
   mixing-ratio variation with latitude is reasonably well predicted,
   whereas the C2H6 distribution is poorly predicted by the models.
   Meridional transport is likely affecting the distribution of C2H6, which
   has a long photochemical lifetime, whereas the distribution of
   shorter-lived C2H2 is controlled by photochemistry and vertical
   diffusion. Given the different observed behavior of C2H2 and C2H6, we
   constrain meridional transport timescales at 2 mbar on Saturn to be in
   the range similar to 100-700 years, corresponding to meridional wind or
   diffusion speeds of similar to 0.4-2 cm s(-1).},

Abstract = {Measurements of the vertical and latitudinal variations of temperature
   and C2H2 and C2H6 abundances in the stratosphere of Saturn can be used
   as stringent constraints on seasonal climate models, photochemical
   models, and dynamics. The summertime photochemical loss timescale for
   C2H6 in Saturn's middle and lower stratosphere (similar to 40-10,000
   years, depending on altitude and latitude) is much greater than the
   atmospheric transport timescale; ethane observations may therefore be
   used to trace stratospheric dynamics. The shorter chemical lifetime for
   C2H2 (similar to 1-7 years depending on altitude and latitude) makes the
   acetylene abundance less sensitive to transport effects and more
   sensitive to insolation and seasonal effects. To obtain information on
   the temperature and hydrocarbon abundance distributions in Saturn's
   stratosphere, high-resolution spectral observations were obtained on
   September 13-14, 2002 UT at NASA's IRTF using the mid-infrared TEXES
   grating spectrograph. At the time of the observations, Saturn was at a
   LS approximate to 270 degrees, corresponding to Saturn's southern summer
   solstice. The observed spectra exhibit a strong increase in the strength
   of methane emission at 1230 cm(-1) with increasing southern latitude.
   Line-by-line radiative transfer calculations indicate that a temperature
   increase in the stratosphere of approximate to 10 K from the equator to
   the south pole between 10 and 0.01 mbar is implied. Similar observations
   of acetylene and ethane were also recorded. We find the 1.16 mbar mixing
   ratio Of C2H2 at -1 degrees and -83 degrees planetocentric latitude to
   be 9.2(-3.8)(+6.4) X 10(-7) and 2.5(-1.0)(+1.8) x 10(-7), respectively.
   The C2H2 mixing ratio at 0.12 mbar is found to be 1.0(-0.3)(+0.5) X
   10(-5) at -1 degrees planetocentric latitude and 2.6(-0.9)(+1.3) X
   10(-6) at -83 degrees planetocentric latitude. The 2.3 mbar mixing ratio
   Of C2H6 inferred from the data is 7.5(-1.7)(+2.3) X 10(-6) and
   1.0(-0.2)(+0.3) X 10(-5) at -1 degrees and -83 degrees planetocentric
   latitude, respectively. Further observations, creating a time baseline,
   will be required to completely resolve the question of how much the
   latitudinal variations Of C2H2 and C2H6 are affected by seasonal forcing
   and/or stratospheric circulation.},

   temperatures, i.e., 370, 295, and 150 K. Only moderate temperature
   effects are observed in the changes of cross-section values of these two
   molecules and are attributed to their high vibrational frequencies of
   the ground electronic states and their repulsive potential surfaces of
   the excited electronic states. When the gas temperature decreases from
   360 to 150 K, the percentage changes of cross sections amount to a

Abstract = {The Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) is a remote-sensing Fourier
   Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on the Cassini orbiter that measures
   thermal radiation over two decades in wavenumber, from 10 to 1400 cm(-1)
   (1 mm to 7 mu m), with a spectral resolution that can be set from 0.5 to
   15.5 cm(-1). The far infrared portion of the spectrum (10-600 cm(-1)) is
   measured with a polarizing interferometer having thermopile detectors
   with a common 4-mrad field of view (FOV). The middle infrared portion is
   measured with a traditional Michelson interferometer having two focal
   planes (600-1100 cm(-1), 1100-1400 cm(-1)). Each focal plane is composed
   of a 1 x 10 array of HgCdTe detectors, each detector having a 0.3-mrad
   FOV. CIRS observations will provide three-dimensional maps of
   temperature, gas composition, and aerosols/condensates of the
   atmospheres of Titan and Saturn with good vertical and horizontal
   resolution, from deep in their tropospheres to high in their
   mesospheres. CIRS's ability to observe atmospheres in the limb-viewing
   mode ( in addition to nadir) offers the opportunity to provide accurate
   and highly resolved vertical profiles of these atmospheric variables.
   The ability to observe with high-spectral resolution should facilitate
   the identification of new constituents. CIRS will also map the thermal
   and compositional properties of the surfaces of Saturn's icy satellites.
   It will similarly map Saturn's rings, characterizing their dynamical and
   spatial structure and constraining theories of their formation and
   evolution. The combination of broad spectral range, programmable
   spectral resolution, the small detector fields of view, and an orbiting
   spacecraft platform will allow CIRS to observe the Saturnian system in
   the thermal infrared at a level of detail not previously achieved.},

Abstract = {The infrared gaseous spectrum of CD3CD3 has been measured in the range
   of 530-670 cm(-1) to investigate vibration-torsion effects in the nu(9)
   band. Three separate spectra all taken under different experimental
   conditions were recorded. The lines with (DeltaK = -1) and with high
   values of K show torsional splittings that are substantially larger than
   expected from the observed barrier height. These splittings are caused
   primarily by Coriolis-type interactions between the torsional stack of
   nu(9) = 1 and the corresponding stack for the ground vibrational state.
   Because of a near-degeneracy that exists between the states (nu(9) = 0,
   nu(4) = 3) and (nu(9) = 1, nu(4) = 0), three subbands (K, sigma) = (15,
   1), (16, 2), (17, 3) are resonantly perturbed. For these cases,
   perturbation-allowed 3nu(4) torsional transitions have been identified.
   Here sigma = 0, 1, 2 or 3 labels the torsional sublevels. Measurements
   from the nu(9) and 3nu(4) bands, frequencies from the far-infrared
   torsional spectra in the ground vibrational state, and lower state
   combination differences from the nu(9) + nu(4) - nu(4) band were fitted
   to within experimental uncertainty using an effective Hamiltonian which
   considered three torsional stacks; one for the ground vibrational state
   and two for nu(9) = 1. In all, 22 parameters were determined using a
   total of 2001 lines. Of these, three parameters were the interstack
   couplings, eight are from the ground vibrational state and I I are from
   the excited vibrational state. Two barrier-dependent torsion-rotation
   parameters, which were essential for obtaining a satisfactory fit, were
   calculated by ab initio methods.},

Abstract = {Infrared emission from nascent products of the methyl radical
   recombination reaction has been detected using time-resolved Fourier
   transform emission spectroscopy. Methyl radicals were generated by 193
   nm photolysis of acetone, and at low pressures emission from nascent
   photofragments (CH3 and CO) is found to dominate. At higher pressures an
   additional emission band is seen in the C-H stretching region, the time
   dependence of which shows a rapid rise and a slow decay, the latter
   being dependent on the laser intensity and accurately described by a
   second-order fit. The emission is assigned to vibrationally excited
   ethane formed by recombination of methyl radicals, with the decay
   identified as the recombination rate and the rapid rise as quenching of
   C2H6 to levels which have no excitation in the emitting mode (the nu(5)
   C-H stretch). The recombination rate constants were determined from fits
   to the decays together with measurements of the laser fluence, and agree
   well with previous determinations. The wavelength dependence of the C2H6
   emission spectrum is invariant with time, and is always red-shifted with
   respect to a room-temperature C2H6 absorption spectrum. This can be
   rationalised in a model which recognises that formation of vibrationally
   excited C2H6 is considerably slower than quenching, and from which it is
   found that the average level of excitation per excited ethane molecule
   reaches a steady-state value after a short induction period. Similar
   spectra and kinetics were observed with other methyl radical sources,
   and emission from the products of the ethyl radical
   recombination/disproportionation reaction was also observed when diethyl
   ketone was photolysed at 193 nm.},

   peaks and increased variability during August-November, which

   column decrease, no evidence was found for a statistically significant

   strongly influenced by the interaction between the nu(4) + nu(8) and

   We found by numerical extrapolation that splittings still occur far from

   vibration-rotation transition wavenumbers for all five torsional
   components, classified according to the symmetry species of the
   G(18)((3)) extended molecular group. The torsional splitting pattern is
   qualitatively similar to that of a nondegenerate vibrational state with
   an even number of excited torsional quanta nu (6). Explorative
   calculations show that the main perturber system should consist of the
   torsional components of the vibrational ground state correlating with nu
   (6) = 3 in the high barrier limit. The strength of the perturbation on
   the E-r0 torsional components of nu (5) increases rapidly with r, the

Abstract = {We present thermal infrared images of Saturn recorded with the
   Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6 meter Telescope (CFHT) in 1992, during Saturn's
   northern summer (145.5 degrees of solar longitude). These observations

   wavelengths (10.91, 11.69, 12.47, 13.09, 13.29 and 13.48 mu m),
   sensitive to phosphine (PH3), ethane (C2H6), and acetylene (C2H2). Many
   features are clearly visible, in particular (i) a bright
   north-equatorial belt (11.69, 12.47, 13.09, 13.29 and 13.48 mu m), (ii)
   a very bright north-polar emission (especially at 11.69 and 12.47 mu m),
   (iii) a darker zone corresponding to the ring occultation. We used an
   infrared radiative transfer code to model the emission of Saturn's
   atmosphere at the observed wavelengths. Three set of parameters are of
   importance: (i) the cloud distribution and properties, (ii) the thermal
   profile, and (iii) the compound abundances. From the present
   observations and from comparison with previous ones obtained by other
   authors (Tokunaga et al. 1978), we can conclude that the observed
   structures likely originate in the seasonal cycle of Saturn. Its effect
   concentrates essentially at levels located above the 200-300 mbar level.
   We also retrieve the latitudinal evolution of the thermal profile: we
   show that the tropospheric temperature decreases towards the pole by
   about 3K, whereas the stratospheric temperature has the same behavior as
   the tropospheric temperature between 15 degrees N and 40 degrees N, and
   greatly increases (about +10K) beyond 60 degrees N. We also explore the
   possibility of explaining these features with variable hydrocarbon
   abundances: an enhancement of a factor of 5.5 of the ethane mixing ratio
   and of a factor of 6 of the acetylene mixing ratio appears then
   necessary at high latitudes (60 degrees N). But, from comparison with
   previous works (Tokunaga et al. 1978), we consider that this latter
   explanation is not likely.},

Abstract = {A model coupling an electron energy degradation code with a detailed
   synthetic spectrum of the H-2 Lyman and Werner band system is used to
   calculate the emerging auroral ultraviolet spectra from Jupiter's
   atmosphere excited by electrons with different initial energy
   distributions. The atmospheric model is adapted from the vertical P-T
   profile measured by the Galileo probe and midlatitude model hydrocarbon
   photochemistry. Each altitude layer, with its own gas temperature,
   contributes to the emergent ultraviolet spectrum and the absorbers are
   vertically distributed within the source region of the auroral
   emissions. Examples of the calculated spectra are shown to validate the
   synthetic spectrum and to illustrate the importance of the electron
   energy distribution and the vertical structure. The model is then
   applied to the analysis of seven HST/GHRS spectra of the 1200-1700
   Angstrom region obtained with 5-Angstrom resolution at various locations
   in the north and south Jovian aurora. These spectra have different color
   ratios which characterize the energy of the precipitated electrons,
   although they do not have a high enough spectral resolution to permit a
   determination of the H-2 temperature. We find that the characteristic
   energy of the assumed initial Maxwellian distribution ranges between 17
   and 40 keV. A clear signature of acetylene absorption is observed near
   1520, 1480, and 1440 Angstrom where the C2H2 cross section shows strong
   absorption peaks. The acetylene column abundance overlying the emission
   peak varies from 0.02 to 0.2 of the methane column. A better fit is
   obtained for some spectra when ethane absorption is added. The C2H6
   column abundance varies from 0 to 0.5 of the methane column. These
   changes relative to methane are presumably the result of perturbations
   by heat released by the fast electron thermalization and/or
   perturbations to the hydrocarbon chemistry resulting from the production
   of H atoms by the aurora, A spectrum of the Io flux tube footprint and
   its trailing tail shows an ultraviolet color and hydrocarbon absorption
   quite similar to some of the main oval spectra, This observation
   suggests that the electrons of the Io flux tube are energized to a few
   tens of keV, similar to the electron precipitated in the main ovals and
   polar caps. Echelle spectra between 1216 and 1220 Angstrom at 0.07
   Angstrom resolution are also compared with the model fitting best the
   mid-resolution spectra. It is found that the effective H-2 rovibrational
   temperature associated with the echelle spectra are significantly higher
   than predicted by the mid-latitude model. A large vertical temperature
   gradient just above the methane homopause due to large heating by
   auroral precipitation is a plausible explanation for this difference.},

   levels upsilon(4) = 0,1,2,..., for upsilon(9) = 1 and the corresponding
   stack for the ground vibrational state. Because of a near-degeneracy
   between the upper level in the nu(9) band and its interacting partner
   (upsilon(9) = 0, upsilon(4) = 3), the (l = -1;K = 17,sigma = 0)
   torsion-rotation series is resonantly perturbed. For this case,
   perturbation-allowed upsilon(4) = 3 <-- 0 torsional transitions have
   been identified. Here sigma = 0, 1, 2, or 3 labels the torsional
   sublevels. Measurements from the nu(9) and 3 nu(4) bands, frequencies
   from the far-infrared torsional spectra in the ground vibrational state,
   and lower state combination differences from nu(9) + nu(4) - nu(4) band
   were fitted to within experimental uncertainty using a symmetry adapted
   effective Hamiltonian which has been used for analyses of similar
   spectra in methyl silane and CH3CD3. Two Coriolis parameters were
   determined: the experimental value of <(zeta)over tilde>(z)(9) =
   0.2610(12) is in good agreement with the calculated value of 0.25,
   whereas the experimental value of <(zeta)over tilde>(x)(4,9) =
   0.2267(20) is about 3 times smaller than the calculated value of 0.60.

Abstract = {The strong and sharp (P)Q(3) subbranch of the v(7) band of ethane near
   2976.8 cm(-1) is relatively free of interfering lines of methane, water
   and ozone and has been utilized as the signature of ethane for
   atmospheric monitoring. This subbranch is unresolvable at the Doppler
   limit, even at low temperature. However, the rotational structure and
   torsional splittings have been obtained by subDoppler molecular-beam
   spectroscopy, along with the air-broadening coefficients and their
   temperature dependence, so that the fundamental band subbranch can be
   well characterized, apart from minor perturbations evident at high J.
   This still leaves a significant fraction of the observed structure and
   intensity in this region unassigned. The strong temperature dependence
   of this extraneous structure enables us to attribute it to torsional hot
   bands, which improves the quantitative estimates of atmospheric ethane.
   We also discuss various approximations to the ethane partition function,
   accounting for the highly anharmonic torsional mode, needed for the
   accurate scaling of the intensities over the wide range of atmospheric

   Delta J(CC), for all these molecules, and also the combination
   J(CC,xx)-J(CC,yy) for ethene, were derived from sets of anisotropic
   couplings (D-exp) analyzed from the H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of
   molecules partially oriented in liquid-crystalline environments. Both
   harmonic vibrations and structural deformations arising from the
   correlation of vibrational and reorientational motions were taken into
   account in the D couplings. The ab initio calculations of all the J
   tensors were performed using MCSCF linear response theory. The best
   calculated and experimental Delta J(CC) values (along with
   J(CC,xx)-J(CC,yy) for ethene) an found to be in good mutual agreement.
   Together with earlier work on the (n)J(CC) tensors in benzene, this
   study shows that the indirect contribution, 1/2J(CC)(aniso), to
   experimental couplings between differently hybridized carbons is small
   and can generally be omitted. This means that the use of experimental
   D-CC couplings in the determination of molecular order tensors and/or
   conformation does not introduce serious errors. The experimental
   determination of the H-1 and C-13 Shielding tensors was based on the
   liquid crystal director rotation by 90 degrees in mixtures of
   thermotropic nematogens with opposite anisotropy of diamagnetic
   susceptibility. Ab initio SCF and MCSCF calculations utilizing
   gauge-including atomic orbitals produce results in good agreement with

   upsilon(12)=0. The shift of each upper level (upsilon(12)=1, l; J,

   National Solar Observatory (31.9 degrees N, 111.6 degrees W, altitude
   2.09 km) on Kitt Peak. Lauder observations were obtained between July
   1993 and November 1997, while the Kitt Peak measurements were recorded
   between May 1977 and December 1997. Both databases were analyzed with
   spectroscopic parameters that included significant improvements for C2H6
   relative to previous studies. Target CO and C2H6 lines were selected to
   achieve similar vertical samplings based on averaging kernels. These
   calculations show that partial columns from layers extending from the
   surface to the mean tropopause and from the mean tropopause to 100 km
   are nearly independent. Retrievals based on a semiempirical application
   of the Rodgers optimal estimation technique are reported for the lower
   laver, which has a broad maximum in sensitivity in the upper
   troposphere. The Lauder CO and C2H6 partial columns exhibit highly
   asymmetrical seasonal cycles with minima in austral autumn and sharp
   peaks in austral spring. The spring maxima are the result of tropical
   biomass burning emissions followed by deep convective vertical transport
   to the upper troposphere and long-range horizontal transport.
   Significant year-to-year variations are observed for both CO and C2H6,
   but the measured trends, (+0.37 +/- 0.57)\% yr(-1) and (-0.64 +/-
   0.79)\% yr(-1), 1 sigma, respectively, indicate no significant long-term

   in the lower layer with trends equal to (-0.27 +/- 0.17)\% yr(-1) and
   (-1.20 +/- 0.35')\% yr(-1), 1 sigma, respectively. Hence a decrease in
   the Kitt Peak tropospheric C2H6 column has been detected, though the CO
   trend is not significant. Both measurement sets are compared with
   previous observations, reported trends, and three-dimensional model
   calculations.},

   region of the C-H stretching fundamental v(7) near 3000 cm(-1). The
   observed hot bands are assigned to the two perpendicular components of
   the v(7) + v(9)(A(1g) + A(2g) + E(g)) <-- v(9)(E(u)) band. The spectrum
   appears to be heavily perturbed by dark state interactions in the upper
   state, forcing us to analyze each K-stack separately. Rotational levels
   in the v(7) + v(9) state up to J = 15 and K = 5 have been least-squares
   fitted to standard symmetric rotor expressions with an average standard
   deviation of 0.0014 cm(-1). No evidence has been found of hot bands
   starting from excited torsional states, indicating that these levels are
   quickly deactivated by V-T transfer to the ground state in the
   collisional environment of the jet; however, the vg state collects a
   substantial population, suggesting that this state is collisionally
   rather stable.},

Abstract = {The strong and sharp (r)Q(0) and (P)Q(3) subbranches of the v(7)
   perpendicular band of C2H6 near 3000 cm(-1) are located in atmospheric
   windows and have been observed in several remote monitoring measurements
   of ethane using infrared solar absorption spectroscopy. We report here
   difference-frequency laser measurements of the air broadening and
   shifting of these Q branches at T = 296 and 160 K in order to improve
   the quantitative analysis of the atmospheric spectra. The air-broadened
   spectra can be fit to high accuracy by convolving the Doppler-limited
   spectra with single shifted Lorentzians with broadening coefficients of
   similar to 0.67 cm(-1)/MPa at 296 K and temperature exponents (gamma
   proportional to T--n) of n similar to 1. The peculiar Doppler contours
   of these Q branches are unresolved, even at the lower temperatures.
   Therefore, in order to model their blended contours, we have recorded
   their sub-Doppler fine structure using a color-center laser optothermal
   molecular beam spectrometer. We have resolved torsional tunneling
   splittings in both Q subbranches and anomalous A(1)-A(2) splittings in
   (P)Q(3) with the individual J components exhibiting distinctive
   nuclear-spin weights. These splittings are induced by high-order
   torsional background perturbing states with localized irregularities,
   making it difficult to model the spectra with simple J(J + 1) power series.},

   0.0030 cm(-1)) has been investigated in the region of the nu(6)(A(2u))
   and nu(8)(E(u)) fundamentals, from 960 cm(-1) to 1180 cm(-1). A strong
   x, y Coriolis interaction between nu(6) and nu(8), with K level
   crossing, generates large displacements of the rotational components of
   both vibrational states, tuning them to additional local resonances in
   several spectral regions. Beyond l resonances with Delta l = +/-2, Delta
   k = -/+1 within nu(8), a z Coriolis-type resonance of nu(3) +
   nu(4)(A(1u)) and nu(6) occurs at K less than or equal to 6, and an x, y
   Coriolis-type resonance of nu(8)(-l, K-1) and nu(3) + nu(4)(K) occurs at
   K = 7 and 8. A further coupling of nu(8) (+l, K-2) and nu(3) + nu(4)(K)
   has been observed as well. The vibration-rotation constants of nu(6),
   nu(8) and nu(3) + nu(4), and several interaction parameters, have been
   determined by the least-squares fit of the available data, with an
   overall standard deviation sigma = 4.6 x 10(-4) cm(-1) in the fit of
   1661 observed transition wavenumbers. A torsional splitting is observed
   only in the level nu(8)(-l, K = 8, J = 20), resonant with 2 nu(4) +
   nu(9)(-l, K = 11, J = 20) in which two torsional quanta nu(4) are
   excited. Many other J components of nu(8)(-l, K = 8) are broadened by
   this interaction. Rules on the symmetries of the allowed perturbing
   operators and of their torsional components in ethane-like molecules are
   determined. In the high-barrier limit, we find it useful to factorize
   the torsional operators into functions of torsional coordinate and
   momentum operators and trigonometric functions of the torsional angle.
   Application of these rules to the coupling operators active in this
   spectrum is made.},

   150-degrees-180-degrees at approximately 60-degrees north latitude,
   approximately corresponding to the CH4 7.8-mum hot spot and the region
   of brightest UV aurora. Significant brightness variations were observed

   Analysis of the brightest hot spot spectra indicates C2H6 mole fractions
   of approximately (6.3-6.8) X 10(-6) at temperatures of approximately
   182-184 K at 1 mbar, compared to mole fractions of (3.8 +/- 1.4) x

   increase near the source of the C2H6 thermal infrared emission. Combined
   with results from similar measurements of ethylene emission probing the
   approximately 10-mubar region (Kostiuk et al., this issue), altitude

   length conditions. Observations were made at resolutions of 0.08, 0.02,
   and 0.016 cm-1 and under various experimental conditions using two
   different Fourier transform spectrometers. In addition, a very high
   resolution (0.0014 cm-1) spectrum of the lowest lying degenerate
   fundamental nu-9 was obtained. From a frequency analysis of the
   far-infrared spectrum and 737 lower state combination differences in
   nu-9 and its associated hot band nu-9 + nu-4 - nu-4, an improved set of
   torsion-rotation parameters was obtained. An intensity analysis of the
   torsional bands was carried out to obtain torsional dipole moments. The
   torsional dipole components mu-perpendicular-to and (mu-parallel-to -
   mu-perpendicular-to) were determined to be 9.37(70) and -31.7(2.0) mu-D,
   respectively. These experimental values are in good agreement with
   calculated values of mu-perpendicular-to = 10.13 mu-D and
   (mu-parallel-to - mu-perpendicular-to) = -35.10-mu-D. The shape of the
   torsional bands can be reproduced in detail with the model adopted here.},

from ∼55 at 2 mbar to ∼277 at 12 mbar. In current photochemical models this ratio
typically increases between 2 and 12 mbar by a factor of ≤3. Recent laboratory
kinetics studies on the reaction between C2H2 and H2 to form C2H4 suggest an efficient
chemical mechanism for hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H6. Inclusion of this scheme
as part of a comprehensive updated model for hydrocarbon photochemistry in the
atmosphere of Jupiter provides an explanation of the altitude variation of the
C2H6/C2H2 ratio. The sensitivity of these results to uncertainties in the key rate
constants at low temperatures is illustrated, identifying needs for additional
laboratory measurements. Since the key reaction rate constants decrease with
decreasing temperature, the hydrogenation of C2H2 as proposed predicts a qualitatively
decreasing trend in the C2H6/C2H2 value with decreasing distance from the Sun.
The observed variation between Jupiter and Saturn is consistent with this prediction.},

molecular orbital theory, for calculation of molecular energies (atomization energies,
ionization potentials, electron affinities, and proton affinities) of compounds

procedure adds three features to G1 theory [J. Chem. Phys. 90, 5622 (1989)] including
a correction for nonadditivity of diffuse-sp and 2df basis set extensions, a basis
set extension containing a third d function on nonhydrogen and a second p function
on hydrogen atoms, and a modification of the higher level correction. G2 theory is
a significant improvement over G1 theory because it eliminates a number of deficiencies
present in G1 theory. Of particular importance is the improvement in atomization
energies of ionic molecules such as LiF and hydrides such as C2H6, NH3, N2H4, H2O2,
and CH3SH. The average absolute deviation from experiment of atomization energies
of 39 first-row compounds is reduced from 1.42 to 0.92 kcal/mol. In addition, G2
theory gives improved performance for hypervalent species and electron affinities
of second-row species (the average deviation from experiment of electron affinities
of second-row species is reduced from 1.94 to 1.08 kcal/mol). Finally, G2 atomization
energies for another 43 molecules, not previously studied with G1 theory, many of

   The prominent features of the spectrum are the P, Q, and R branches of
   the torsional fundamental (upsilon-4 = 1 <-- 0) and the Q branch of the
   first torsional overtone (upsilon-4 = 2 <-- 1).  The P and R branches of

Abstract = {Total column abundances of ethane (C2H6) above the Jungfraujoch Station,
   Switzerland, 3.58-km altitude, have been deduced from infrared solar
   spectra recorded in 1951 and from 1984 to 1988. The results were derived
   from the spectroscopic analysis of the v7 band P(Q3), P(Q1), and R(Q0)
   subbranches of C2H6 near 2976.8, 2983.4, and 2986.7 cm-1, respectively.
   The 1984-1988 results obtained from more than 300 observations at 0.005
   cm-1 resolution show a definite seasonal variation in the total vertical
   column abundance of that gas, with a maximum of (1.43 +/- 0.03) x 10(16)
   molecules/cm2 during March and April and a minimum in the fall. The
   corresponding C2H6 mixing ratio in the free troposphere was derived to
   1.53 +/- 0.14 ppb in early April; the ratio of maximum to minimum C2H6
   concentration in the troposphere was found to be 1.88 +/- 0.12. From the
   analysis of the same spectral features observed in March and April 1951,
   we have deduced a total vertical column abundance of (1.09 +/- 0.10) x
   10(16) molecules/cm2. Assuming an exponential increase with time and
   correcting for a small decrease in the stratospheric amount of C2H6 due
   to the man-induced increase in stratospheric chlorine, we obtain a
   secular trend in the tropospheric burden above the Jungfraujoch equal to
   (0.85 +/- 0.3)\% yr-1. It is argued that this trend is valid for the
   entire northern hemisphere.},

are much more precise than those calculated from diffraction internuclear distances.

of ν12 was found. The structure of the ν10 band shows beyond doubt that the point
group of the molecule is D3d. From the ν11+ν4 infrared band, and the ν11 Raman band,
the value, 278.4 cm.−1, is deduced for the torsional frequency ν4.},

potential constants of the ethane molecule. In order to fill in some of the gaps
in the spectroscopic data, additional high resolution measurements have been made
on the infrared spectrum of heavy ethane which have given more precise values for
the active fundamental frequencies and zeta‐values. Resolution of the fine structure
associated with the parallel band ν5* has given the value of the large moment of
inertia of C2D6, thus completing the information required for the spectroscopic
determination of the dimensions of ethane. The data yield, C–C distance=1.543A,
C–H distance=1.102A, H–C–C angle=109°37′, and H–C–H angle=109°19′. The twenty‐two
distinct potential constants compatible with the D3d symmetry of ethane have been
determined through their relationships to the normal frequencies and zeta‐values
of C2H6 and C2D6. The normal frequencies have been obtained by addition of anharmonic
corrections to the spectroscopically observed fundamental frequencies. These corrections
were estimated by means of the known anharmonic corrections for methane and the
conditions imposed by the Teller product rule. The fundamental frequencies and
zeta‐values have been taken directly from the observed band centers and rotational
spacings wherever possible. In the cases of resonance, the influence of the couplings
were either calculated or estimated and the corresponding unperturbed values for
the frequencies and zeta‐values selected. The potential function is determined
first in terms of a set of simple symmetry coordinates, and then reexpressed in
terms of valence coordinates to permit comparison of the valence force constants
of ethane and methane.},

Pages = {451-459},
abstract = {If there were free internal rotation in C2H6 the rotational structure
of certain perpendicular type infrared bands would be very different from that
for the customary symmetrical top molecule without internal rotation. To account
for the fact that this difference is not observed it is necessary to assume that
there is a potential difference of at least 2000 cal. (700 cm—1) between the two
symmetrical forms of C2H6 differing by an internal rotation of 2π/6. A potential
of this magnitude corresponds to an internal torsion vibration of 230 cm—1. The
above conclusion is based upon a dynamical treatment of C2H6 in which it is assumed
that vibration, over‐all rotation, and internal rotation subject to a restricting
potential may occur simultaneously. An approximate form of the Hamiltonian expression
obtained is H=12{(Px⎯px)2/A+(Py⎯py)2/A+(Pz⎯pz)2/C+(Pγ⎯pγ)2/C+∑p2k}+V, where γ represents
the angle of internal rotation. The rotational selection rules are determined and
it is found that under ordinary circumstances the internal rotation when free is
inactive in the infrared rotation‐vibration spectrum. However, when there is accidental
degeneracy of certain pairs of twofold degenerate vibrational levels, the internal
rotation becomes active in the infrared bands for these vibrations. In such a case
of accidental vibrational degeneracy, which is approximated to by at least two sets
of vibrations in C2H6, the rotation‐vibration frequency for the infrared bands
involves the quantity (h/4π2)[(K±K′)(1−ζ)/C–K/A] if the internal rotation is free;
K and K′ are the quantum numbers of over‐all and internal rotation about the threefold
symmetry axis and ζ is a quantity depending on the angular momentum of vibration.
The observed rotational spacing, however, is well reproduced by a frequency containing
instead the quantity (h/4π2)K[(1−ζ)/C−1/A], which is to be expected if C2H6 is an
ordinary symmetrical top molecule without internal rotation.},

Two of these have been resolved into individual lines, with a strong Q branch

the same for all degrees of restriction of the internal rotation except for the
rules governing the appearance of the degenerate frequencies in the Raman spectrum,
so that even in the limit of free rotation only one type of degenerate vibrational
frequency is active in the infrared spectrum. A normal coordinate treatment based
