Abstract = {The Fourier transform infrared spectrum of ethane between 2860 and 3060
   cm(-1) has been re-investigated under high resolution at 229 K. The
   infrared absorption in this region is due mainly to the CH stretching
   fundamentals vs (parallel band) and nu(7) (degenerate perpendicular
   band), and to the parallel combination system nu(8) + nu(11) (A(4s),
   A(3s)). All the relevant perturbation mechanisms affecting the observed
   absorption patterns have been clarified. In particular, the main
   perturbers of the nu(7) state are identified to be the degenerate
   vibrational combination states nu(8) + nu(11) (l-type interaction) and
   nu(3) + 2 nu(4) + nu(8) (Fermi-type interaction). Because of the last
   interaction, the K `'Delta K = -6 transitions occur with intensities
   comparable to both the infrared active fundamental nu(7) and the almost
   dark combination nu(3) + 2 nu(4) + nu(8). The parallel combination
   system nu(8) + nu(11) (A(4s), A(3s)) is overlapped and heavily perturbed
   by the nearby parallel system nu(4) + nu(11) + nu(12) (A(4s), A(3s)).
   whose K-structure is spread by the strong z-Coriolis interaction of its
   two vibrational components. In this work, 95 new transitions to the
   perturbers of nu(7) have been assigned. They belong mostly to the
   degenerate vibrational states nu(8) + nu(11) (E-1d) and nu(3)+ 2 nu(4) +
   nu(8) (E-1d), and to the parallel system nu(8) + nu(11) (A(4s), A(3s)).
   A least squares fit calculation, limited to the nu(7) degenerate
   fundamental and its degenerate perturbers nu(8) + nu(11), nu(3) + 2
   nu(4) + nu(8), nu(4) + nu(11)+ nu(12), and nu(3) + 3 nu(4) + nu(12) was
   performed. From the results of this fit, we created a line-by-line
   database containing the molecular parameters for 4969 transitions in
   these five bands of (C2H6)-C-12. Finally, we identified the degenerate
   combination band nu(2) + nu(8) (62 observed transitions) to be the main
   perturber (x, y-Coriolis-type interaction) of the parallel fundamental
   nu(5). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The room temperature spectrum of ethane in the region of the nu(6) and
   nu(8) fundamentals, between 1330 and 1610 cm(-1), has been
   re-investigated at a resolution of 0.002 cm(-1). It is shown that the
   complex spectral structure with numerous strong local perturbations,
   which had hindered a global analysis of this region until now, is caused
   by a network of l-type resonances acting within the Fermi (or
   torsional-Coriolis) coupled system nu(8), nu(4) + nu(12). The
   x,y-Coriolis interaction between nu(6) and nu(8) and vibration-rotation
   interactions between nu(6) and 2 nu(4) + nu(9) also generate relevant
   effects on the spectrum. With an appropriate Hamiltonian model
   accounting for all these effects, we could fit 1814 upper state level
   energies belonging to nu(6), vs and nu(4) + nu(12) with an overall RMS
   deviation better than 3.8 X 10(-3) cm(-1). The determined values of the
   intrinsic torsional splittings in the different vibrational states are
   in agreement with the theoretical expectations. The intrinsic torsional
   splitting almost vanishes in nu(8), as in digermane and disilane; it is
   slightly larger in nu(4) + nu(12) than in nu(4), due to the decrease of
   the torsional barrier height with the excitation of nu(12). For the 2
   nu(4) + nu(9) state, the determined values of the vibrational origin and
   torsional splittings are in good agreement with the large increase of
   the torsional barrier height expected with the excitation of the nu(9)
   mode.
   Several hot transitions originating from the v(4) = 1 torsional state
   have been observed. An analysis of 294 line positions belonging to the
   (nu(4) + nu(8)) - nu(4) hot band has been performed, leading to a fit
   with a RMS deviation of 5.1 X 10(-3) cm(-1). It is shown that a complex
   network of l-type resonances is also active in the nu(4) + nu(8), 2
   nu(4) + nu(12) system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Toward an accurate database for the 12 mu m region of the ethane

Pages = {750-757},
Abstract = {The v(9) fundamental band of ethane occurs in the 12 mu m region. It is
   the strongest band of ethane in a terrestrial window in the thermal
   infrared and is commonly used to determine ethane's abundance in the
   atmospheres of the Jovian planets and comets and to determine their
   temperature. Precise and accurate absolute intensities of this band are
   crucial for correct interpretation of recent Cassini observations of
   ethane spectra in the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan, as well as of
   Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS)
   observations in the terrestrial atmosphere. Using a spectrum of the v(9)
   band of ethane recorded at 278 K at the Pacific Northwest National
   Laboratory, we show that the line parameters available in the HITRAN and
   GEISA databases do not allow reproduction of the experimental data to
   within their accuracy. In fact, the integrated band intensity calculated
   at 296 K using both line lists are, respectively, a factor 1.57 larger
   and 1.44 smaller than the observed value. Using results from a recent
   global analysis of data involving the four lowest vibrational states of
   ethane and measurements of pressure-broadening parameters, we generate a
   new set of line parameters which we show to provide a much more accurate
   description of the experimental spectrum of C2H6 in the 12 mu m region.},

abstract = {Various examples of perturbations in the vibration-rotation-torsion energy levels of an ethane molecule exhibiting internal rotation splittings are discussed, both from the point of view of the point group D3d, appropriate when internal rotation tunneling effects cannot be observed, and from the point of view of the group G36Ü, appropriate when internal rotation tunneling in ethane leads to observable splittings in the spectrum. It is found, for perturbations allowed in both D3d and G36Ü, that each of the two torsional components of the perturbed D3d vibration-rotation level can in principle interact with a ìcorrespondingî torsional component in the perturbing vibration-rotation level. It is found for perturbations forbidden in D3d but allowed in G36Ü, which all occur between D3d vibrational levels of different g, u parity, that only one of the two torsional components of the perturbed D3d vibration-rotation level can interact with a corresponding torsional component in the perturbing vibration-rotation level. Some of the perturbations examined give intensity to otherwise forbidden transitions in such a way that perturbation-induced transitions can be used in conjunction with normally allowed transitions to determine the sum of the internal rotation splittings for two rotational levels differing in K by three units.}

abstract = "The strong and sharp pQ3 subbranch of the ŒΩ7 band of ethane near 2976.8cm-1 is relatively free of interfering lines of methane, water and ozone and has been utilized as the signature of ethane for atmospheric monitoring. This subbranch is unresolvable at the Doppler limit, even at low temperature. However, the rotational structure and torsional splittings have been obtained by subDoppler molecular-beam spectroscopy, along with the air-broadening coefficients and their temperature dependence, so that the fundamental band subbranch can be well characterized, apart from minor perturbations evident at high J. This still leaves a significant fraction of the observed structure and intensity in this region unassigned. The strong temperature dependence of this extraneous structure enables us to attribute it to torsional hot bands, which improves the quantitative estimates of atmospheric ethane. We also discuss various approximations to the ethane partition function, accounting for the highly anharmonic torsional mode, needed for the accurate scaling of the intensities over the wide range of atmospheric temperatures."

Measurements in bulk and in jet were performed in an intracavity arrangement. The present analysis is concentrated on totally, symmetric transitions. Numerous Q branches of overtones and binary combination tones appeared in the spectrum. All first overtones of both the degenerate and non-degenerate modes have been observed. Several multiple combination tones have also been identified. Some hot bands due to transitions starting from the thermally excited v4 torsional level appeared as satellite Q branches. From the measured band origins the anharmonic shifts are determined and a table with the anharmonicity constants is constructed. The occurrence of a few very strong Fermi resonances enhancing the intensity of otherwise weak bands has been observed. A comparative study of some overtone Raman spectra of three substituted ethanes (CH3CF3, CH3, CH3SiH3, CH3CD3) has been undertaken. The existence of a strong interaction between the CH3 symmetric stretching modes and the overtones of the asymmetric deformation modes appears to be characteristic only for the CH3CH3 and CH3CD3 molecules."
