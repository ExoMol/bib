abstract = {{The 33Πg state of the dicarbon molecule, C2, has been identified for the first time by a combination of resonant ionization spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and high-level ab initio quantum chemical calculations. This marks the discovery of the final valence triplet state of C2 spectroscopically accessible from the lowest triplet state. It is found to be vibronically coupled to the recently discovered 43Πg state, necessitating vibronic calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to reconcile calculated rotational constants with observations. The 33Πg state of C2 is observed to have a much shorter fluorescence lifetime than expected, possibly pointing to predissociation by coupling to the unbound d3Πg state.}},

Abstract = {{Vibrational levels of the recently observed high-spin transition (1
   (5)Pi(u) - 1 (5)Pi(g)) of dicarbon {[}P. Bornhauser et al., J. Chem.
   Phys. 142, 094313 (2015)] are explored by applying non-linear
   double-resonant four-wave mixing and laser-induced fluorescence methods.
   The deperturbation of the d (3)Pi(g), v = 8 and 1 (5)Pi(g), v = 3 states
   results in accurate molecular constants for the v = 3 ``dark{''} quintet
   state. In addition, the spin-orbit interaction constant is determined
   and parameters for the upper Swan level d (3)Pi(g), v = 8 are improved.
   The first excited vibrational state of 1 (5)Pi(g) is observed by
   performing perturbation-assisted intersystem crossing via ``gateway{''}
   states in the d (3)Pi(g), v = 6 similar to 1 (5)Pi(g), v = 0 system. The
   rotationally resolved spectra yield 11 transitions to 1 (5)Pi(u), v = 1
   that include four spin-substates. Data reduction results in accurate
   molecular constants of this vibrational level in the shallow potential
   energy surface of this state. Finally, 3 = 1 and 2 of the lower quintet
   state (1 (5)Pi(g)) are measured by performing perturbation-assisted
   double-resonant excitation to the 1 (5)Pi(u), v = 0 state and observing
   dispersed fluorescence. The obtained molecular constants are compared
   with high level ab initio computations at the multi-reference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) level of theory by using a large
   correlation consistent basis set or, alternatively, by applying the
   computationally less demanding method of explicitly correlated
   multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI-F12). The spectroscopic
   accuracy of both methods is evaluated by comparison with the
   experimental findings. }},
