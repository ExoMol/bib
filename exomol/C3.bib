Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2001},
Volume = {553},
Pages = {267-273},
Abstract = {The smallest polyatomic carbon chain, C-3, has been identified in
   interstellar clouds (A(upsilon)similar to 1 mag) toward zeta Ophiuchi,
   20 Aquilae and zeta Persei by detection of the origin band in its
   A(1)II(u)-X(1)Sigma (+)(g) electronic transition, near 4052 Angstrom.
   Individual rotational lines were resolved up to J = 30, allowing the
   rotational-level column densities and temperature distributions to be
   determined. The inferred limits for the total column densities (similar
   to1-2 x 10(12) cm(-2)) offer a strong incentive to laboratory and
   astrophysical searches for the longer carbon chains. Concurrent searches
   for C-2(+), C-2(-), and C-3(-) were negative, but provide sensitive
   estimates for their maximum column densities.},

title = {{Detection of a dense clump in a filament interacting with W51e2 ⋆}},
journal = AA,
year = {2014},
volume = {566},
pages = {A61},
abstract = {In the framework of the Herschel/PRISMAS guaranteed time key program,
the line of sight to the distant ultracompact H ii region W51e2 has been observed
using several selected molecular species. Most of the detected absorption features
are not associated with the background high-mass star-forming region and probe the
diffuse matter along the line of sight. We present here the detection of an additional
narrow absorption feature at ~70 km s-1 in the observed spectra of HDO, NH3 and C3.
The 70 km s-1 feature is not uniquely identifiable with the dynamic components
(the main cloud and the large-scale foreground filament) so-far identified toward
this region. The narrow absorption feature is similar to the one found toward
low-mass protostars, which is characteristic of the presence of a cold external
envelope. The far-infrared spectroscopic data were combined with existing ground-based
observations of 12CO, 13CO, CCH, CN, and C3H2 to characterize the 70 km s-1 component.
Using a non-LTE analysis of multiple transitions of NH3 and CN, we estimated the
density (n(H2) ~ (1–5) × 105 cm-3) and temperature (10–30 K) for this narrow feature.
We used a gas-grain warm-up based chemical model with physical parameters derived
from the NH3 data to explain the observed abundances of the different chemical species.
We propose that the 70 km s-1 narrow feature arises in a dense and cold clump that
probably undergoes collapse to form a low-mass protostar, formed on the trailing
side of the high-velocity filament, which is thought to be interacting with the W51
main cloud. While the fortuitous coincidence of the dense clump along the line
of sight with the continuum-bright W51e2 compact H ii region has contributed to
its nondetection in the continuum images, this same attribute makes it an appropriate
source for absorption studies and in particular for ice studies of star-forming regions.},

bond lengths, but different bond angles between them. For the singlet and triplet
ground states in the linear geometry, the total energies resulting from the mixed
density functional—Hartree-Fock and quadratic configuration interaction methods
reproduce the experimental values, i.e., the triplet occurs 2.1 eV above the singlet.
In the geometry of an equilateral triangle, we find a low-lying triplet state with an
energy of only 0.8 eV above the energy of the singlet in the linear configuration,
so that the triangular geometry yields the lowest excited state of C3. For the
higher excited states up to about 8 eV above the ground state, we apply time-dependent
density functional theory. Even though the systematic error produced by this approach
is of the order of 0.4 eV, the results give different prospective to insight into
the potential energy landscape for higher excitation energies.},

Abstract = {The vibrational structure of the (A) over bar (1)Pi(u) electronic state
   of C-3 in the region 26 000-30 775 cm(-1) has been re-examined, using
   laser excitation spectra of jet-cooled molecules. Rotational constants
   and vibrational energies have been determined for over 60
   previously-unreported vibronic levels: a number of other levels have
   been re-assigned. The vibrational structure is complicated by
   interactions between levels of the upper and lower Born-Oppenheimer
   components of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, and by the effects of
   the double minimum potential in the Q(3) coordinate, recognized by Izuha
   and Yamanouchi {[}16]. The present work shows that there is also strong
   anharmonic resonance between the overtones of the v(1) and v(3)
   vibrations. For instance, the levels 2 1(+)1 and 0 1(+)3 are nearly
   degenerate in zero order, but as a result of the resonance they give
   rise to two levels 139 cm(-1) apart, centered about the expected
   position of the 2 1(+)1 level. With these irregularities recognized,
   every observed vibrational level up to 30 000 cm(-1) (a vibrational
   energy of over 5000 cm(-1)) can now be assigned. A Sigma(+)(u) vibronic
   level at 30181.4 cm(-1), which has a much lower B' rotational constant
   than nearby levels of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, possibly
   represents the onset of vibronic perturbations by the (B) over
   tilde'(1)Delta(u) electronic state; this state is so far unknown, but is
   predicted by the ab initio calculations of Ahmed et al. {[}36].},

    CCD spectra of the well-studied translucent sight line toward HD 147889 in
    the ρ Oph dark cloud complex. These observations show that HD 147889 is
    actually a double-lined spectroscopic binary consisting of two B2 IV-V
    components with rotational (υ sin i) velocities of about 30 and 70 km s-1,
    an orbital period of about 5 days, and a radial velocity semiamplitude of

    previous interstellar absorption-line studies of this object. Despite this
    potential stellar confusion, we have tentatively identified an interstellar
    absorption feature at the wavelength (4051.6 Å) expected for an unresolved
    blend of the strongest Q-branch lines arising from the ground vibrational

decrease with excitation in $\nu$1. Interpretation of the physical meaning of

    observed over a period of 17 years. The data have been reduced homogeneously
    to molecular production rates and a proxy for the dust production rate.
    We confirm previous investigations, both our own and those of others, showing
    that there is no differentiation with depth in the cometary nucleus, that most
    comets are very similar to each other in chemical composition, and that the
    dust-to-gas ratio does not vary with the dynamical age of the comet. There
    is little variation of relative abundances with heliocentric distance,
    implying that for the species we observe the role of density-dependent processes
    in the coma is small. There is also little variation from one apparition to
    the next for most short-period comets.We show, however, that there are
    significant compositional groupings of comets, apparently related to place
    of formation. Specifically, the majority of comets originating in the Kuiper
    belt appear to be significantly depleted in the carbon-chain molecules that
    lead to the observed C2 and C3. Kuiper belt comets also exhibit smaller active
    areas, steeper slopes, and greater asymmetries about perihelion than do other
    comets, implying smaller active fractions. We argue that at least the
    compositional effect is primordial rather than evolutionary. We also show a
    significant but unexplained correlation of some properties, notably the
    dust-to-gas ratio, with perihelion distance. We provide strong evidence that
    most CN, some C2, and virtually no NH are produced from grains in the coma
    rather than from nuclear ices. Evidence suggests that the mixing between water
    and other ices occurs at the level of grains rather than at the molecular level.
    We also show that there must be a large population of comets having very low
    activity. The data appear to require mixing of cometesimals with different
    compositions into individual nuclei, with some nuclei containing nearly the
    full range of compositions seen in the ensemble while others contain a much
    smaller range of compositions. },

    Cloud (LMC). The stars represent the superwind phase on the asymptotic giant
    branch (AGB), which forms a major source of dust for the interstellar medium
    (ISM) in galaxies. Bolometric magnitudes indicate progenitor masses of 1.5-2.5Msolar.
    The spectra cover the wavelength range 5-38μm. They show varying combinations
    of dust continuum, dust emission features (SiC, MgS) and molecular absorption
    bands (C2H2, HCN). A 10-μm absorption feature is attributed to C3. A weak band
    at 5.8μm is suggestive of carbonyl. The circumstellar 7.5-μm C2H2 band is found
    to be stronger at lower metallicity, explained by higher C/O ratios at low
    metallicity. The J - K versus K - A colours, used to select the sample, are
    shown to be relatively insensitive in separating carbon versus oxygen-rich
    AGB stars. The predominance of carbon stars therefore indicates that in the
    range 1.5-2.5Msolar, LMC AGB stars become carbon-rich before onset of the superwind.
    A set of four narrow bands, dubbed the Manchester system, is used to define
    the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. We investigate the strength
    and central wavelength of the SiC and MgS dust bands as a function of colour
    and metallicity. The line-to-continuum ratio of these bands shows some
    indication of being lower at low metallicity. The MgS band is only seen at
    dust temperatures below 600K. Metal-poor carbon stars can form amorphous
    carbon dust from self-produced carbon. The formation efficiency of oxygen-rich
    dust depends more strongly on metallicity. In lower-metallicity environments,
    the dust input into the ISM by AGB stars may be strongly biased towards
    carbonaceous dust. },

    was made for carbon particles emitted as positive ions, but none were found.
    Heats of activation were obtained for the neutrals and the more abundant
    negative ions from the slopes of logp vs 1/T plots. Identical heats measured
    for C1 and C3 (178±10 kcal/mole at 2400°K) suggest that these two species
    may sublime at rates that are interdependent. Thus, this value may not be
    representative of the true heat of sublimation of C1. For C2, a heat of 199±20
    kcal/mole was measured at 2400°K. Electron affinities have been computed
    for C1, C2, and C3, and estimated bond energies deduced for C2 and C3.
    Some of the earlier measurements of the heat of sublimation of graphite,
    obtained from rates of vaporization and equilibrium effusion, but without
    mass analysis, have been reinterpreted, taking into account the complex
    character of the sublimation processes. },

spectra of jet-cooled molecules. Rotational constants and vibrational energies
have been determined for over 60 previously-unreported vibronic levels; a number
of other levels have been re-assigned. The vibrational structure is complicated
by interactions between levels of the upper and lower Born–Oppenheimer components
of the A ˜ 1 Π u state, and by the effects of the double minimum potential in
the Q 3 coordinate, recognized by Izuha and Yamanouchi [16]. The present work
shows that there is also strong anharmonic resonance between the overtones of
the ν 1 and ν 3 vibrations. For instance, the levels 2 1+ 1 and 0 1 + 3 are nearly
degenerate in zero order, but as a result of the resonance they give rise to two
levels 139 cm−1 apart, centered about the expected position of the 2 1+ 1 level.
With these irregularities recognized, every observed vibrational level up
to 30 000 cm−1 (a vibrational energy of over 5000 cm−1) can now be assigned.
A Σ u + vibronic level at 30181.4 cm−1, which has a much lower B′ rotational
constant than nearby levels of the A ˜ 1 Π u state, possibly represents the onset
of vibronic perturbations by the B ˜ ′ 1 Δ u electronic state; this state is so
far unknown, but is predicted by the ab initio calculations of Ahmed et al. [36].},

   As the perimeter of the molecule increases, the C-2v disjoint seams
   approach the D-3h one almost linearly and ultimately coalesce with it at
   Q(1) = 5.005 a(0), thence forming an intersection node or confluence. By
   further increasing the size of the molecular triangle, the C2v seams get
   rotated by +/-pi in the g-h plane. A three-state vibronic Hamiltonian is
   also proposed to model locally the title system and shown to accurately
   mimic the calculated data over the region close to the minimum energy
   crossing point. No net geometric phase effect is observed when the

   enclosing the intersection node, the sign reversal criterion is shown to
   be not fulfilled, even for infinitesimal loops. The results so obtained

Abstract = {C-3 is a molecular chain which has been observed in interstellar clouds

   vibrational bending transitions are in the same energy range as the
   rotational transitions. In this paper, we apply our recently developed
   quantum scattering method for treating atom rigid bender inelastic
   collisions at the Close Coupling level to the collision of C-3 by
   helium. This method allows us to compute the rovibrational transitions
   induced by collisions. The purely rotational transitions have been also
   calculated, using the rigid monomer approximation. The accuracy of this
   last approximation in the case of a system with a significant
   vibrational-rotational coupling is discussed. The first evaluation of
   the cross-sections associated with the rovibrational transitions between
   levels belonging to different vibrational bending levels is also
   presented. We observe that the propensity rule for the rovibrational
   transitions is a competition between the smallest Delta j and the
   smallest transition energy. As a consequence, cross-sections and rate
   coefficients of vibrationally inelastic transitions can be several
   orders of magnitude larger than for purely rotational transitions.},

   accuracy and low computational cost for the generation of
   multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) over both intra- and

   2D-PES for linear C-3 and the CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ 4D-PES for bent C3
   configurations gently approach those mapped at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVXZ

   the pattern of the rovibrational levels of the intermediate C-3-He
   complex and the rotational and rovibrational (de-) excitation of C-3 by
   He derived using both sets of PESs agree quite well. Since C-3 shows a

Abstract = {We report the detection of eight vibronic bands of C-3, seven of which
   have been hitherto unobserved in astrophysical objects, in the
   translucent cloud towards HD 169454. Four of these bands are also found
   towards two additional objects: HD 73882 and HD 154368. Very high
   signal-to-noise ratio (similar to 1000 and higher) and high resolving
   power (R = 80 000) UVES-VLT spectra (Paranal, Chile) allow for detecting
   novel spectral features of C-3, even revealing weak perturbed features
   in the strongest bands. The work presented here provides the most
   complete spectroscopic survey of the so far largest carbon chain
   detected in translucent interstellar clouds. High-quality laboratory
   spectra of C-3 are measured using cavity ring-down absorption
   spectroscopy in a supersonically expanding hydrocarbon plasma, to
   support the analysis of the identified bands towards HD 169454. A column
   density of N(C-3) = (6.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(12) cm(-2) is inferred and the
   excitation of the molecule exhibits two temperature components; T-exc =
   22 +/- 1 K for the low-J states and T-exc = 187 +/- 25 K for the high-J
   tail. The rotational excitation of C-3 is reasonably well explained by
   models involving a mechanism including inelastic collisions, formation
   and destruction of the molecule, and radiative pumping in the
   far-infrared. These models yield gas kinetic temperatures comparable to
   those found for T-exc. The assignment of spectral features in the
   UV-blue range 3793-4054 angstrom may be of relevance for future studies
   aiming at unravelling spectra to identify interstellar molecules
   associated with the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs).},

Pages = {13878-13884},
Abstract = {The fluorescence lifetimes of 115 vibrational levels of the (A) over
   tilde (1)Pi(u) state of C-3 have been measured under supersonic
   molecular beam conditions. Of these, ninety-one are Pi(u), vibronic
   levels, for which the lifetimes lie in the range 190-700 ns. The
   lifetimes of those flu levels where only the bending vibration is
   excited lie in the range 190-235 ns. There is very little variation with
   bending quantum number, and the lifetimes of the two orbital components
   of the (1)Pi(u) state are essentially the same. When v(1) and v(3) are
   excited, the lifetimes become longer and/or reach a maximum for levels
   with v(1) + v(3) similar to 4. Excitation of the bending vibration in
   addition to the stretching vibrations shortens the lifetime slightly.
   Several of the levels show double-exponential decays. Another 23 levels,
   of Sigma(+)(u): vibronic symmetry, mostly have lifetimes that are longer
   than 300 ns. Interaction with nearby ``dark{''} electronic states, such
   as (B) over tilde (1)Sigma(-)(u), (B) over tilde `1 Delta(u,) (C) over
   tilde (1)Pi(g), and (b) over tilde (-3)Pi(g), is proposed to account for
   the observed lifetime lengthening. A particularly clear instance of such
   an interaction is the long lifetime (914 ns) of a perturbing Sigma(+)(u)

   spectroscopy is realized to access the (dark) triplet manifold of the
   C-3 molecule from the singlet (X) over tilde (1) Sigma(+)(g) ground
   state. The inherent non-linear signal dependence and coherence of the
   technique result in a favorable detection of the excited triplet states
   of interest. The observation of a newly found (3)Delta(u) electronic
   state is achieved by a two-step excitation via ``gate-way{''} levels
   (i.e., singlet-triplet mixed levels). Additionally, by fixing the probe
   laser on a transition exhibiting mainly triplet-triplet character and
   scanning the pump laser, we demonstrate an effective spin-filtering in a
   four-wave mixing measurement where only transitions to the perturber
   (3)Sigma(-)(u) state appear exclusively in an otherwise congested
   spectral range of the Comet band. Ab initio calculations of excited
   triplet states complement our analysis with the electronic assignment of
   the observed resonances. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Title = {{Chemistry of C-3 and carbon chain molecules in DR21(OH)}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {546},
pages = {A75},
Abstract = {Context. C-3 is the smallest pure carbon chain detected in the dense
   environment of star-forming regions, although diatomic C-2 is detected
   in diffuse clouds. Measurement of the abundance of C-3 and the chemistry
   of its formation in dense star-forming regions has remained relatively
   unexplored.
   Aims. We aim to identify the primary C-3 formation routes in dense
   star-forming regions following a chemical network producing species like
   CCH and c-C3H2 in the star-forming cores associated with DR21(OH), a
   high-mass star-forming region.
   Methods. We observed velocity resolved spectra of four ro-vibrational
   far-infrared transitions of C-3 between the vibrational ground state and
   the low-energy nu(2) bending mode at frequencies between 1654-1897 GHz
   using HIFI on board Herschel, in DR21(OH). Several transitions of CCH
   and c-C3H2 were also observed with HIFI and the IRAM 30 m telescope.
   Rotational temperatures and column densities for all chemical species
   were estimated. A gas and grain warm-up model was used to obtain
   estimates of densities and temperatures of the envelope. The chemical
   network in the model was used to identify the primary C-3 forming
   reactions in DR21(OH).
   Results. We detected C-3 in absorption in four far-infrared transitions,
   P(4), P(10), Q(2), and Q(4). The continuum sources MM1 and MM2 in
   DR21(OH), though spatially unresolved, are sufficiently separated in
   velocity to be identified in the C-3 spectra. All C-3 transitions are
   detected from the embedded source MM2 and the surrounding envelope,
   whereas only Q(4) and P(4) are detected toward the hot core MM1. The
   abundance of C-3 in the envelope and MM2 is similar to 6 x 10(-10) and
   similar to 3 x 10(-9), respectively. For CCH and c-C3H2, we only detect
   emission from the envelope and MM1. The observed CCH, C-3 and c-C3H2
   abundances are most consistent with a chemical model with n(H2) similar
   to 5 x 10(6) cm(-3), a post-warm-up dust temperature T-max = 30 K, and a
   time of similar to 0.7-3 Myr.
   Conclusions. Post-warm-up gas phase chemistry of CH4 released from the
   grain at t similar to 0.2 Myr and lasting for 1 Myr can explain the
   observed C-3 abundance in the envelope of DR21(OH), and no mechanism
   involving photodestruction of PAH molecules is required. The chemistry
   in the envelope is similar to the warm carbon chain chemistry found in
   lukewarm corinos. We interpret the observed lower C-3 abundance in MM1
   as compared to MM2 and the envelope to be due to the destruction of C-3
   in the more evolved MM1. The timescale for the chemistry derived for the
   envelope is consistent with the dynamical timescale of 2 Myr derived for
   DR21(OH) in other studies.},

Abstract = {Fluorescence excitation spectra and wavelength-resolved emission spectra
   of the C-3-Kr and C-3-Xe van der Waals (vdW) complexes have been
   recorded near the 2(0)(2-), 2(0)(2+), 2(0)(4-), and 1(0)(1) bands of the
   (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) - (X) over tilde (1)Sigma(+)(g) system of the
   C-3 molecule. In the excitation spectra, the spectral features of the
   two complexes are red-shifted relative to those of free C-3 by 21.9-38.2
   and 34.3-36.1 cm(-1), respectively. The emission spectra from the (A)
   over tilde state of the Kr complex consist of progressions in the two
   C-3-bending vibrations (nu(2), nu(4)), the vdW stretching (nu(3)), and
   bending vibrations (nu(6)), suggesting that the equilibrium geometry in
   the (X) over tilde state is nonlinear. As in the Ar complex {[}Zhang et
   al., J. Chem. Phys. 120, 3189 (2004)], the C-3-bending vibrational
   levels of the Kr complex shift progressively to lower energy with
   respect to those of free C-3 as the bending quantum number increases.
   Their vibrational structures could be modeled as perturbed harmonic
   oscillators, with the dipole-induced dipole terms of the Ar and Kr
   complexes scaled roughly by the polarizabilities of the Ar and Kr atoms.
   Emission spectra of the Xe complex, excited near the (A) over tilde,
   2(2-) level of free C-3, consist only of progressions in even quanta of
   the C-3-bending and vdW modes, implying that the geometry in the higher
   vibrational levels (nu(bend) >= 4, E-vib >= 328 cm(-1)) of the (X) over
   tilde state is (vibrationally averaged) linear. In this structure the Xe
   atom bonds to one of the terminal carbons nearly along the inertial
   a-axis of bent C-3. Our ab initio calculations of the Xe complex at the
   level of CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ (C) and aug-cc-pVTZ-PP (Xe) predict that
   its equilibrium geometry is T-shaped (as in the Ar and Kr complexes),
   and also support the assignment of a stable linear isomer when the
   amplitude of the C-3 bending vibration is large (nu(4) >= 4). (C) 2011

Journal = AA,

Abstract = {Context. Fragmentation-branching ratios of electronically excited
   molecular species are of first importance for the modeling of gas phase
   interstellar chemistry. Despite experimental and theoretical efforts
   that have been done during the last two decades there is still a strong
   lack of detailed information on those quantities for many molecules such
   as C-n, CnH or C3H2.
   Aims. Our aim is to provide astrochemical databases with more realistic
   branching ratios for C-n (n = 2 to 10), CnH (n = 2 to 4), and C3H2
   molecules that are electronically excited either by dissociative
   recombination, photodissociation, or cosmic ray processes, when no
   detailed calculations or measurements exist in literature.
   Methods. High velocity collision in an inverse kinematics scheme was
   used to measure the complete fragmentation pattern of electronically
   excited C-n (n = 2 to 10), CnH (n = 2 to 4), and C3H2 molecules.
   Branching ratios of dissociation where deduced from those experiments.
   The full set of branching ratios was used as a new input in chemical
   models and branching ratio modification effects observed in
   astrochemical networks that describe the dense cold Taurus Molecular
   Cloud-1 and the photon dominated Horse Head region.
   Results. The comparison between the branching ratios obtained in this
   work and other types of experiments showed a good agreement. It was
   interpreted as the signature of a statistical behavior of the
   fragmentation. The branching ratios we obtained lead to an increase of
   the C-3 production together with a larger dispersion of the daughter
   fragments. The introduction of these new values in the photon dominated
   region model of the Horse Head nebula increases the abundance of C-3 and
   C3H, but reduces the abundances of the larger C-n and hydrocarbons at a
   visual extinction AV smaller than 4.
   Conclusions. We recommend astrochemists to use these new branching
   ratios. The data published here have been added to the online database

Abstract = {We present spectrally resolved observations of triatomic carbon (C-3) in

   GHz along the sight-lines to the submillimeter continuum sources W31C
   and W49N, using Herschel's HIFI instrument. We detect C-3 in absorption
   arising from the warm envelope surrounding the hot core, as indicated by
   the velocity peak position and shape of the line profile. The
   sensitivity does not allow to detect C-3 absorption due to diffuse
   foreground clouds. From the column densities of the rotational levels in
   the vibrational ground state probed by the absorption we derive a
   rotation temperature (T-rot) of similar to 50-70 K, which is a good
   measure of the kinetic temperature of the absorbing gas, as radiative
   transitions within the vibrational ground state are forbidden. It is
   also in good agreement with the dust temperatures for W31C and W49N.
   Applying the partition function correction based on the derived T-rot,
   we get column densities N(C-3) similar to 7-9 x 10(14) cm(-2) and
   abundance x(C-3) similar to 10(-8) with respect to H-2. For W31C, using
   a radiative transfer model including far-infrared pumping by the dust
   continuum and a temperature gradient within the source along the line of
   sight we find that a model with x(C-3) = 10(-8), T-kin = 30-50 K, N(C-3)
   = 1.5 x 10(15) cm(-2) fits the observations reasonably well and provides
   parameters in very good agreement with the simple excitation analysis.},

Title = {{Ab initio potential energy surface and intermolecular vibrational
   frequency of C3-He complex}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {107},
Number = {15},
Pages = {1541-1547},
Abstract = {The intermolecular potential energy surface for C3-He complex has been
   constructed using supermolecular CCSD(T) and MP4 methods. The potential
   surfaces have been calculated for 27 values of R ranging from 2.8 to 8.0
   angstrom and 19 values of equally spaced between 0 degrees and 180
   degrees. Both CCSD(T) and MP4 potentials have similar global behaviors.
   The global minimum in each of the potentials corresponds to the slightly
   distorted T-shaped geometry. On the basis of these two potentials, the
   intermolecular vibrational energies and wavefunctions were calculated.
   The energy level pattern of the vdW vibrational states was predicted for
   C3-He complex. The zero point bending motion of this complex has a range
   of 180 degrees. The calculated fundamental frequency of vdW bending is
   3.16 cm-1 at CCSD(T) level, and 5.38 cm-1 at the MP4 level. In addition,
   we have also constructed the intermolecular potential energy surface
   with C3 bending coordinate of 160 degrees by using supermolecular
   CCSD(T) method. Two local minima including arrow-shaped and Y-shaped
   configurations were determined. The rotational constants of three C3-He
   structures including T-shaped, arrow-shaped and Y-shaped configurations
   at CCSD(T) level were also reported.},

   excited states up to the 9th root of each symmetry are computed, and
   several new states with large oscillator strengths are found below the

Abstract = {Uncapped linear C-n clusters have been studied with hybrid density

   well with the bond length alternation (BLA) of the optimized geometry.
   Due to end effects, the BLA is not constant along the chains. The degree

   nonalternating structures (cumulenic), then turning into strongly
   alternating (acetylenic) structures. This transition has not yet been

Journal = JACS,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {129},
Number = {33},
Pages = {10229-10243},
Abstract = {Small carbon clusters (C(n), n = 2-15) are produced in a molecular beam
   by pulsed laser vaporization and studied with vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)
   photoionization mass spectrometry. The required VUV radiation in the
   8-12 eV range is provided by the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at the
   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mass spectra at various
   ionization energies reveal the qualitative relative abundances of the
   neutral carbon clusters produced. By far the most abundant species is
   C(3). Using the tunability of the ALS, ionization threshold spectra are
   recorded for the clusters up to 15 atoms in size. The ionization
   thresholds are compared to those measured previously with
   charge-transfer bracketing methods. To interpret the ionization
   thresholds for different cluster sizes, new ab initio calculations are
   carried out on the clusters for n = 4-10. Geometric structures are
   optimized at the CCSD(T) level with cc-pVTZ (or cc-pVDZ) basis sets, and
   focal point extrapolations are applied to both neutral and cation
   species to determine adiabatic and vertical ionization potentials. The
   comparison of computed and measured ionization potentials makes it
   possible to investigate the isomeric structures of the neutral clusters
   produced in this experiment. The measurements are inconclusive for the n
   = 4-6 species because of unquenched excited electronic states. However,
   the data provide evidence for the prominence of linear structures for
   the n = 7, 9, 11, 13 species and the presence of cyclic C(10).},

Abstract = {A new apparatus is described that uses nonlinear and linear

   Short-lived species are generated by applying a well-defined discharge
   on a suitable precursor prior to supersonic expansion. Femtosecond
   ionization and mass spectrometry is used to optimize the discharge
   source. Degenerate and two-color resonant four-wave mixing spectroscopy
   (DFWM and TC-RFWM, respectively) are used in tandem with laser-induced
   fluorescence (LIF) and cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRD). We
   demonstrate initial experiments on the 4051 angstrom band of C-3 (A(1)

   character of the methods and the potential of simultaneously measured
   spectra. High signal-to-noise ratios and well-structured spectra are
   obtained by DFWM. LIF is favorable for the observation of weak features

Journal = {Eur. Phys. J.-Spec. Top.},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {27-40},
Abstract = {In this paper we describe how infrared vibrational spectroscopy has been
   applied in our laboratory to three areas of interest to interstellar
   chemistry: the origin of the unidentified interstellar infrared emission
   bands, the depletion of the iron in the interstellar medium, and the
   fractionation of isotope-bearing molecules in space. In the. rst area,
   infrared absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
   their ions trapped in cryogenic rare gas matrices have been analyzed and
   shown to coincide well with the frequencies and relative intensities of
   the unidentified infrared emission bands. These bands have been observed
   from many sources in interstellar space, including reflection and
   planetary nebulae and H II regions, in parts of the Milky Way, as well
   as other galaxies. In the second area, a free electron laser, with
   tunable output in the infrared, has been utilized to record resonant
   multiphoton photodissociation vibrational spectra of various polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons complexed with Fe+ in a Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Stable complexes found for Fe+
   and a number of PAHs suggest that iron could be sequestered in such
   species and that they could function as carriers of the unidentified
   infrared emission bands. In the third area, the photo-induced
   C-13-isotopic scrambling in the C-3 carbon cluster has been investigated
   by matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy. Fractionation is shown to
   arise from small zero-point energy differences in the C-3 isotopomers. A
   proposed mechanism of isotopic scrambling involving the formation of
   cyclic C-3 intermediates may be applicable to other species for which
   isotopic fractionation has also been observed in the ISM.},

Abstract = {We report here the first observation of the D (1)Delta(g) state of the
   C-3 radical, which provides the first comprehensively analyzed example
   of the dynamic Renner-Teller splitting in Delta symmetry. Two color
   double resonance spectroscopy via the A (1)Pi(u) state was employed to
   experimentally probe an extensive range of vibronic levels in this D
   (1)Delta(g) state, covering all three modes of vibration of C-3. The
   analysis was supported by ab initio potential energy surface
   calculations on the C-3 radical to outline the lowest eight singlet
   electronic states. Two methods were used to analyze the Renner-Teller
   effect. The first method is an empirical Hamiltonian based on normal
   modes, using harmonic oscillator functions as a basis, with
   Renner-Teller and other terms added as required, which allows
   conventional vibrational parameters to be determined. The second is a
   much larger program that uses the exact kinetic energy operator for a
   triatomic molecule to calculate vibronic energy levels directly from the
   Renner-Teller pair of potential energy surfaces. Both methods give a
   good fit to the experimental results, with only a small adjustment to
   the ab initio surfaces required for the latter. One of the overall
   conclusions is that the Renner-Teller effect is rather smaller in the D
   (1)Delta(g) state than in the A (1)Pi(u) state. (c) 2006 American

   analysis of these extra lines shows that at least two long-lived states

   (3)Sigma(u)(-) vibronic state, which may possibly be a high vibrational
   level of the b (3)Pi(g) state, and the other appears to be a P=1 state

Abstract = {Ab initio multireference configuration interaction potential energy
   surfaces are computed for the eight lowest singlet surfaces of C-3.
   These reveal several important features, including several conical
   intersections in linear, nonlinear, and equilateral triangle geometries.
   These intersections are important because, particularly for the excited
   A (1)Pi(u) state, reasonable ab initio results could only be obtained by
   including nearby, near degenerate, (1)Sigma(u)(-) and (1)Delta(u) states
   that cross the A (1)Pi(u) state around 4500 cm(-1) above the equilibrium
   geometry, and a (1)Pi(g) state whose potential in turn crosses the other
   states about 2000 cm(-1) further up. These states are probably
   responsible for the complexity of the shorter wavelength UV absorption
   spectrum of C-3. The computed potential energy surface for the ground, X
   (1)Sigma(g)(+), state and for the lowest two excited singlet surfaces
   (which both correlate with the A (1)Pi(u) state in a collinear geometry)

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {121},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5767-5776},
Abstract = {In this work, we present ab initio calculations for the potential energy
   surfaces of C-3 in different electronic configurations, including the
   singlet ground state {[}(X) over tilde (1)Sigma(g)(+),((1)A(1))], the
   triplet ground state {[}(a) over tilde (3)Pi(u),(B-3(1), (3)A(1))], and
   some higher excited states. The geometries studied include triangular
   shapes with two identical bond lengths, but different bond angles
   between them. For the singlet and triplet ground states in the linear
   geometry, the total energies resulting from the mixed density
   functional-Hartree-Fock and quadratic configuration interaction methods
   reproduce the experimental values, i.e., the triplet occurs 2.1 eV above
   the singlet. In the geometry of an equilateral triangle, we find a
   low-lying triplet state with an energy of only 0.8 eV above the energy
   of the singlet in the linear configuration, so that the triangular
   geometry yields the lowest excited state of C-3. For the higher excited
   states up to about 8 eV above the ground state, we apply time-dependent
   density functional theory. Even though the systematic error produced by
   this approach is of the order of 0.4 eV, the results give different
   prospective to insight into the potential energy landscape for higher
   excitation energies. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

Title = {{The C-3-bending levels of the C-3-Ar complex studied by optical
   spectroscopy and ab initio calculation}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {120},
Number = {7},
Pages = {3189-3200},
Abstract = {The (A) over tilde-(X) over tilde electronic transition of C-3-Ar, near
   405 nm, has been studied by both laser-induced fluorescence and
   wavelength-resolved emission techniques. Emission spectra have been
   recorded from 14 vibrational levels of the (A) over tilde state of
   C-3-Ar; these spectra consist of progressions in the ground state v(2)
   and v(4) vibrations (the in- and out-of-plane C-3-bending motions,
   respectively). With increasing bending excitation, these ground state
   levels shift progressively downwards compared to those of free C-3,
   indicating that the van der Waals complexes are becoming more tightly
   bound. The level structure of the two vibrations of C-3-Ar has been
   fitted to a perturbed harmonic oscillator model, where the potential
   function has the form V=V(1)r cos theta+V(2)r(2) cos 2theta (r is the
   amplitude of the C-3-bending motion and theta gives the orientation of
   the rare gas atom relative to the plane of the bent C-3 molecule). Ab
   initio calculations have been carried out for C-3-Ar at the
   coupled-cluster singles, doubles (and triples)/correlation consistent
   polarization valence quadruple-zeta level. They predict that the C-3-Ar
   complex is nearly T shaped at equilibrium, and that as the C-3 molecule
   bends away from the linear configuration, the preferred orientation is
   ``arrow{''} shaped. From the results of the best fit to the model and
   the emission spectral intensities, the relative orientation of the
   out-of-plane pi electron of the (A) over tilde -state complex and the Ar
   atom has been estimated. No bands of the Ar complex were found near the
   C-3, (A) over tilde-(X) over tilde, (0,0) band, consistent with the fact
   that the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u), v=0 level of free C-3 is strongly
   perturbed by triplet levels. In the excitation spectra of the Ar
   complex, the bands with v(b)'>0 show redshifts of about 16-36 cm(-1)
   compared to those of free C-3, indicating that the (A) over tilde -state
   complex in these levels is more tightly bonded than the (X) over tilde
   -state complex. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {The circumstellar envelopes of very evolved, late-type asymptotic giant
   branch stars exhibit complex molecular structure. The most striking of
   these objects is the carbon star IRC +10216 (CW Leo), where over 50
   molecular species, including carbon chains with up to nine carbon atoms,
   have been detected. The envelope of IRC +10216 is now known to contain
   dust shells of enhanced density which are well correlated with molecular
   shells seen in interferometric observations. The inclusion of shells,
   based on observed parameters, into a chemical model allows observations
   to be matched more closely. Another effect of enhanced density shells is
   the narrowing of the radii over which the peak abundances occur.
   Previous models tended to have the molecules spread over a larger band
   of radii than observations indicated. Thus, the effects of enhanced
   density shells are extremely important for understanding the
   circumstellar environments of stars such as IRC +10216.},

   molecule C 3 with respect to EB-V varies considerably from one star to
   an other. There is no correlation with EB-V. The strong variations in
   the abundance of C-3 must therefore be caused by another circumstance.
   We point out that this may be the case: from an analysis of the

   differences in the state of ionization produced by interstellar photons
   with energies below the ionization potential of hydrogen. The ratio of

Abstract = {Carbon molecules were produced by evaporation of graphite and

   the absorption spectra of the carbon clusters were recorded from 1100 to

   recorded from 1200 to 9000 Angstrom. We observed an intense, broad
   absorption band system centered at around 1600 Angstrom in neon and 1700
   Angstrom in argon. By measuring the excitation spectrum of the (3)Pi(u)
   --> X (1)Sigma(g)(+) phosphorescence and checking the intensity
   correlation with the known (1)Pi(u) <-- X (1)Sigma(g)(+) absorption
   band, we could show that the observed VUV band system is the allowed
   (1)Sigma(u)(+) <-- X (1)Sigma(g)(+) electronic transition of the C
   Molecule. At the blue and the red side of the band system, distinct
   progressions can be observed which most likely correspond to a symmetric
   stretch of about nu(1) approximate to 1100 cm(-1) and a bending mode of
   about nu(3) approximate to 550 cm(-1), respectively. In the band center,
   however, a complicated superposition of several vibrational progressions
   appears indicating that besides the (1)Sigma(u)(+) state also other
   states seem to contribute to the absorption. Quantum chemical MR-AQCC
   calculations suggest that these contributing states are (1)Pi(g) states
   which are close in energy to the (1)Sigma(u)(+) state and can interact
   via vibronic coupling, a conjecture supported by preliminary
   calculations of synthetic spectra in which such coupling was included.
   Furthermore, the calculations show that the (1)Sigma(u)(+) energy
   decreases upon bending, leading to a complex landscape of energy
   surfaces which include avoided crossing type features, and rendering
   more detailed spectral calculations difficult.},

Abstract = {The laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of C-3 are measured under
   jet-cooled conditions in the wide UV region of 266-310 nm, and 173
   vibronic bands are identified. Among them, 77 and 68 vibronic bands were
   found to exhibit Sigma-Sigma type and Pi-Sigma type rotational
   structures, respectively. From the rotational analysis, the band-origin
   wave numbers and the rotational constants of the upper Sigma and Pi
   vibronic levels and K-type doubling parameters for the Pi vibronic
   levels are determined. The rotational constants for the Sigma and Pi
   vibronic levels exhibit, respectively, similar distributions with almost
   the same mean values, (B) over bar'=0.395(14) and 0.398(17) cm(-1),
   indicating that the Sigma and Pi vibronic levels have the same
   electronic origin and that the average C-C bond distance of the upper
   electronic state in the observed energy range is about 1.331(25)
   Angstrom, which is longer than the electronic ground (X) over tilde
   (1)Sigma (+)(g) state by 0.054(25) Angstrom. The convolution and
   Fourier-transform analyses are performed separately for the spectra
   composed only of Sigma-Sigma type and Pi-Sigma type vibronic bands to
   derive estimates of the vibrational fundamentals in the upper electronic
   state. The low nu (1) fundamental of 940(60) cm(-1) derived from these
   analyses and the seemingly regular nu (1) progression in the convoluted
   spectra indicate that the bright character is carried primarily by the
   transitions to the vibrational levels in the (1)Delta (u) electronically
   excited state and is distributed into a large number of the originally
   dark transitions to the vibrational levels in the (1)Pi (g)

Pages = {10129-10142},
Abstract = {We have studied small carbon molecules using a matrix-isolation
   technique. Our experimental setup is described in detail. The carbon
   clusters were produced by evaporating graphite and trapping the
   carbon-vapor molecules in solid argon, where molecular growth could be
   induced by controlled matrix annealing. To identify the produced
   molecules, absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible and
   infrared (IR) spectral ranges was applied. Additional characterization
   of the excited and ground states of the molecules was obtained from
   emission and excitation spectra. The molecules were excited by a pulsed
   dye laser system and the emission spectra were recorded with a
   high-sensitivity photodiode-array spectrometer. We present our
   measurements on linear C-3. The (A) over tilde (IIu)-I-1 excited state
   of linear C-3 was populated by the electronic transition (A) over tilde
   (IIu <--)-I-1(X) over tilde (1)Sigma(g)(+), and the corresponding
   excitation spectra of the C-3 fluorescence ((A) over tilde (IIu)-I-1
   -->(X) over tilde (1)Sigma(g)(+)) and phosphorescence ((a) over tilde
   (IIu)-I-3-->(X) over tilde (1)Sigma(g)(+)) were studied. Comparison of
   excitation and absorption spectra yielded information on site effects
   due to the matrix environment. Emission bands in the fluorescence and
   phosphorescence spectra up to vibrational energies of 8500 cm(-1) could
   be observed. The radiation lifetime of the (A) over tilde (IIu)-I-1
   excited state of C-3 in solid argon was found to be shorter than 10 ns.
   The phosphorescence transition (a) over tilde (3)IIu-->(X) over tilde
   (1)Sigma(g)(+) decays in about Id ms and its rise indicates fast
   vibrational relaxation within the triplet system. Our data support a
   linear ground state geometry for C3 also in solid argon. (C) 1998

Abstract = {In the infrared spectra of C-3 trapped in rare gas matrices at low
   temperatures T similar or equal to 10 K, two bands in the nu(3)
   asymmetric stretching region have been observed, one intense at higher
   frequency (HF) and the other, weaker at lower frequency (LF), These
   bands have been attributed to two different trapping sites in the
   matrix. In this paper semi-empirical atom-atom potential energy
   calculations, based on pairwise additive interactions, have been
   performed in order to understand the nature of these trapping sites and
   the influence of the matrix on the C-3 molecular geometry. The
   vibrational frequency shifts due to the matrix surroundings are
   calculated for bent and linear molecular configurations in several
   different trapping sites. In the calculated infrared spectra, no
   significant absorption occurs in the nu(1) symmetric stretching region,
   while the nu(2) bending and nu(3) asymmetric stretching modes exhibit
   weak and strong bands, respectively. Finally, from a comparison of the
   calculated and experimental spectra in the nu(3) region, it is predicted
   that C-3 should be in the bent configuration when trapped in a matrix,

   summarized as follows: (1) The RRBs are found in the spatial location
   where carbonaceous grains are being impinged upon by a bipolar outflow.
   (2) C-3 is known to accompany circumstellar carbon grains and may
   constitute a `magic' fragment in the UV photofragmentation of C-n

   emission bands in this object suggests that charged particle impact

   In our investigations we used a Monte Carlo model. The average lifetime
   for C-3 has been found to be 6.3 x 10(4) s and that for the parent of
   C-3 to 6 x 10(3) s. The spatial profiles of C-3 were almost symmetric
   and we need only 0.1 cm s(-2) as the tailward acceleration. According to
   our simulations, C3H4 (allene) can be considered as the parent for C-3.
   We obtained the average value 7.6 x 10(4) s for the lifetime of NH2 and
   1.1 x 10(4) s for the lifetime of the NH2 parent. The tailward
   acceleration of NH2 was not more than 0.1 cm s(-2). This result does not
   exceed the latest theoretical calculations of NH2 and NH3 lifetimes by a
   factor of 1.4. So, NH3 may be considered as a parent for NH2 in the

Abstract = {The nu1 + nu3 combination mode of laser-ablated C3 has been observed in

   totally symmetric mode frequencies have been determined by difference
   with the known nu3 asymmetric stretching frequencies, corrected for
   anharmonicity effects. A comparison of certain isotopomer pairs reveals
   that C3 is bent in these matrices. A normal coordinate analysis using
   four force constants resulted in an excellent fit of the 12 observed
   frequencies (nu1 and nu3 for six isotopomers). From the fit, a value for
   the nu2 bending mode frequency of 82 cm-1 was obtained. This is shown to
   be in good agreement with the value obtained from the C3 phosphorescence
   spectrum. Finally, the molecular bending angle which was determined to
   be 160.0-degrees (in Ar and Kr) is shown to match very well with the
   predicted value from ab initio theory (161.6-degrees) and from a fitting
   of a Morse oscillator-rigid bender potential to gas phase vibrational

   The spectrum is dominated by emissions from OH, NH, CH, C3, and CN, some
   of the weaker emissions of which are seen here for the first time.  More
   bands of CO2+ were found than in any previous investigation and several
   intensity anomalies were noted; H2CO, OH+, NCN, N2+, and CN+ may be
   present.  Several emission features well above the noise level remain
   unidentified.  The relative intensities of the OH and CN bands agree

   respectively.  The 2164-cm-1/223-nm correlation represents  the first
   positive assignment for an electronic band due to C5.  The similarity of
   the 223-nm band system with the so-called 217.5-nm interstellar
   ``hump{''} has been noted and it is suggested that linear C5 clusters
   may be responsible for this much-discussed feature.  Good correlations
   were also found for the 2039-cm-1/283-nm, 2039-cm-1/410-nm, and
   1695-cm-1/586-nm pairs.  The 2039-cm-1/410-nm bands are known to
   originate from C3, while the species responsible for the 1695-cm-1/586
   nm pair is suggested to be a cyclic cluster of six or more carbons.  A
   prominent UV band system at 247.1 nm has been correlated with an IR band
   at 2004-cm-1 and tentatively assigned to linear C-9},

Journal = JMS,
Year = {1984},
Volume = {107},

Abstract = {Rotation-vibration energy levels of the isomers CCN+ and CNC+ have
been determined in the following way: A large number of points in the minimum
region of the 1Σ+ electronic ground state surfaces of the two ions have been
computed by single reference state complete single and double excitations configuration
interaction (CI-SD) calculations using canonical SCF orbitals as a molecular orbital basis.
The effect of certain higher excitations has also been taken into account by
using the Davidson estimate (CI-SDQ). A force constant expansion has been fitted
by least squares to the ab initio points, and the resulting potential expression
has been used to calculate rotational and vibrational constants using the perturbation
theory expressions. In order to assess the reliability of these calculations and,
in particular, the flexibility of the Gaussian basis sets used, identical calculations
have been performed for the isoelectronic C3 radical. For C3 the rotational and
vibrational energy levels obtained by the perturbational approach are compared to
those calculated using the nonrigid bender Hamiltonian. The nonrigid bender results
at the CI-SDQ level are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental
data. From these CI-SDQ calculations the equilibrium structure of the ground state
of C3 is obtained as bent (αe = 162°, re = 1.290 Å). Dipole moment functions and
vibrational transition moments have also been calculated for all three molecules.
The transition moment for the ν3 fundamental of C3 is found to be very large (0.44 Debye).},

Abstract = {Since their discovery over 40 years ago, the origin of the diffuse
interstellar absorption lines has been a mystery although there have been many
suggestions put forward. Developments in spectroscopy and astronomy have intensified
rather than reduced the mystery. This letter takes into account some of these recent
developments and suggests a rather definite (but unconfirmed) identification of the lines.
Excellent surveys of the diffuse interstellar lines have been given by Herbig1
and by Wu2, so the many studies of these lines will not be mentioned again. For our
purposes, it is sufficient to note that the strongest line which lies at 4,428 Å
has a half width of 20 Å, and that 38 weaker lines of varying strengths and widths
lie at longer wavelengths. The strength of the lines is strongly correlated with
regions in space containing interstellar grains (particularly small grains) and there
is strong evidence that all the lines arise from a single species or from closely
related species. The only feature in the spectrum lying to the violet of 4,428 Å which
seems to be related to the diffuse lines is a continuum in the 2,200 Å region but this
must certainly involve much higher electronic states of the absorbing species.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1974},
Volume = {60},
Number = {3},
Pages = {754-759},
Abstract = {Large‐amplitude bending of linear, homonuclear, triatomic molecules
is analyzed, with curvilinear departure of the atoms from normal coordinate bending
included. The curvilinear motion is deduced from the observed variation of rotational
constant with bending quantum number. The effect of this motion is to decrease the
energy eigenvalues; energy states with lowest angular momentum are decreased most.
These effects counteract the effects of a steeper than harmonic bending potential.
A harmonic oscillator model of C3 is fitted to the observed rotational constant
within 0.6%, and the bond distance between atoms in the linear configuration of C3
is found to be 1.287 Å; noticeably larger than the average internuclear distance
of the vibrational ground state, 1.277 Å. First order perturbation results, including
the effect of a quartic perturbation potential, approximately duplicate the pattern
of energy levels observed. Square well bending potential wavefunctions are presumed
to represent a limiting approximation for high vibrational levels of C3 since these
provide the divergence of upper levels required to fit the measured vapor pressure
of graphite. In this case, the effects of curvilinear motion are similar to those
obtained for the harmonic oscillator model, although somewhat larger decreases in
energy are obtained. In either case, the average energy decrease is relatively
constant—the order of 10%—over a wide range of vibrational quantum number. This
means that the usual normal mode analysis can be adjusted to approximate the effects
of curvilinear motion and explains why normal mode approximations can often be
extended beyond the limits of small‐amplitude bending and yet give reasonably good
results.},

Abstract = {A quadratically perturbed square well potential is used to derive
quantized bending mode vibrational energy levels for the C3 molecule. Coupling
with rotational modes and l doubling is neglected for simplicity. The model is
constrained to a best fit with observed lower vibrational levels in the lowest

maximum possible divergence. Thus a lower limit for the partition function and the
entropy of C3 is established; the neglected rotational coupling has little influence
on these quantities because the splitting of levels is almost symmetrical.
The limits obtained support the classical model of Strauss and Thiele for the
thermodynamic properties of C3 rather than the estimates listed in current JANAF
Thermochemical Tables, and imply that recent graphite vapor pressure measurements
made by Zavitsanos and by Wachi and Gilmartin are more correct than earlier measurements.},

Abstract = {Ab initio calculations have been carried out to determine a potential
curve for the bending motion of C3. The work was in part motivated by the disagreement
between theoretical and experimental values of the entropy of C3. Three basis sets were
used, with (4s2p), (4s2p1d), and (4s3p1d) centered on each carbon atom. Both self‐consistent‐field
(SCF) and configuration interaction (CI) (656 configurations) calculations were
carried out with the smallest basis. The CI wavefunctions were obtained by a method
which may be viewed as an extension of the pseudonatural orbital technique of
Edmiston and Krauss. Using the smallest basis, both SCF and CI calculations
yield ``normal'' bending frequencies, ∼320 cm−1. It is concluded that electron
correlation has little effect on the bending frequency. The larger (4s2p1d)
and (4s3p1d) basis SCF calculations yield much smaller bending frequencies, the
latter being 69 cm−1, in good agreement with the unusually low experimental value
of Gausset, Herzberg, Lagerqvist, and Rosen. The bending potential is predicted
to be quite anharmonic. These results are discussed qualitatively in terms of a
Walsh diagram and the importance of d orbitals by symmetry considerations.},

the partner state of the same symmetry near equilateral triangular geometries

   substituted isotopologues have been investigated, and spectroscopic
   parameters based on term energies up to J = 30 have been calculated.
   Available experimental vibrational term energies are reproduced to
   better than 1 cm(-1) and rotational constants show relative errors of
   not more than 0.01\%. The equilibrium bond length has been determined in
   a mixed experimental/theoretical approach to be 1.294 07(10) A in
   excellent agreement with the ab initio composite value of 1.293 97 A.
   Theoretical band intensities based on a newly developed electric dipole
   moment function also suggest that the infrared active (1,1(1),0)(0,0(0),0) combination
   band might be observable by high-resolution spectroscopy.},
