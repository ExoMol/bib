Abstract = {{Fluorine containing molecules have a particularly long atmospheric
   lifetime and their very big estimated global warming potentials are
   expected to rapidly increase in the future. This work is focused on the
   global theoretical prediction of infrared spectra of the
   tetrafluoromethane molecule that is considered as a potentially powerful
   greenhouse gas having the largest estimated lifetime of over 50 000
   years in the atmosphere. The presence of relatively low vibrational
   frequencies makes the Boltzmann population of the excited levels
   important. Consequently, the ``hot bands'' corresponding to transitions
   among excited rovibrational states contribute significantly to the CF4
   opacity in the infrared even at room temperature conditions but the
   existing laboratory data analyses are not sufficiently complete. In this
   work, we construct the first accurate and complete ab initio based line
   lists for CF4 in the range 0-4000 cm(-1), containing rovibrational bands
   that are the most active in absorption. An efficient basis set
   compression method was applied to predict more than 700 new bands and
   subbands via variational nuclear motion calculations. We show that
   already at room temperature a quasi-continuum of overlapping weak lines
   appears in the CF4 infrared spectra due to the increasing density of
   bands and transitions. In order to converge the infrared opacity at room
   temperature, it was necessary to include a high rotational quantum
   number up to J = 80 resulting in 2 billion rovibrational transitions. In
   order to make the cross-section simulation faster, we have partitioned
   our data into two parts: (a) strong \& medium line lists with lower
   energy levels for calculation of selective absorption features that can
   be used at various temperatures and (b) compressed ``super-line''
   libraries of very weak transitions contributing to the quasi-continuum
   modelling. Comparisons with raw previously unassigned experimental
   spectra showed a very good accuracy for integrated absorbance in the
   entire range of the reported spectra predictions. The data obtained in
   this work will be made available through the TheoReTS information system
   (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr, http://theorets.tsu.ru) that contains ab
   initio born line lists and provides a user-friendly graphical interface
   for a fast simulation of the CF4 absorption cross-sections and radiance
   under various temperature conditions from 80 K to 400 K.}},
