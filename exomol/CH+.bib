Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of the low-lying five (1)Sigma(+) and
   (1)Pi states (X-1 Sigma(+), C-1 Sigma(+), 3(1)Sigma(+), A(1)Pi, and D-1
   Pi states) of a CH+ molecule, an important interstellar molecule, were
   calculated by the free complement (FC) local Schrodinger equation (LSE)
   theory with the direct local sampling scheme. The FC wave functions were
   constructed based on the chemical formula theory (CFT), whose local
   characters correspond to the covalent dissociations: C+(P-2
   degrees(s(2)p))) + H(S-2) of the X-1 Sigma(+) and A(1)Pi states and the
   ionic dissociations: C(D-1(s(2)p(2))) + H+ of the C-1 Sigma(+) and D-1
   Pi states. All the calculated PECs were obtained with satisfying the
   chemical accuracy, i.e., error less than 1 kcal/mol, as absolute total
   energy of the Schrodinger equation without any energy shift. The
   spectroscopic data calculated from the PECs agreed well with both
   experimental and other accurate theoretical references. We also analyzed
   the wave functions using the inverse overlap weights proposed by Gallup
   et al. with the CFT configurations. For the X-1 Sigma(+) and A(1)Pi
   states, the covalent C+(sp2) and C+(p3) configurations played important
   roles for bond formation. In the small internuclear distances of the C-1
   Sigma(+), D-1 Pi, and 3(1)Sigma(+) states, the covalent character was
   also dominant as a result of the electron charge transfer from C to H+.
   Thus, the present FC-LSE results not only are accurate but also can
   provide chemical understanding according to the CFT.},
