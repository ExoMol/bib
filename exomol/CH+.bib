title = {Unveiling Two Deeply Embedded Young Protostars in the S68N Class 0 Protostellar Core with JWST/NIRSpec},
journal = ApJ,
abstract = {The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7–5.3 μm observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (AK ∼ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 ±0.15 cm s−2. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines H i are not detected. The South Central source, which is even more embedded (AK ∼ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 μm) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in H2 and CO rovibrational lines. Shock modeling of the H2 (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast C-type shocks (≥30 km s−1), with high pre-shock density (≥107 cm−3), and strong magnetic field (b ∼ 3–10, where ) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, i.e., irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH+ rovibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.}

Title = {{Potential Energy Curves of the Low-Lying Five <SUP>1</SUP>Σ<SUP>+</SUP>
   and <SUP>1</SUP>Π States of a CH<SUP>+</SUP> Molecule Based on the Free
   Complement - Local Schrodinger Equation Theory and the Chemical Formula
   Theory}},
Journal =JCTC,
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of the low-lying five (1)Sigma(+) and
   (1)Pi states (X-1 Sigma(+), C-1 Sigma(+), 3(1)Sigma(+), A(1)Pi, and D-1
   Pi states) of a CH+ molecule, an important interstellar molecule, were
   calculated by the free complement (FC) local Schrodinger equation (LSE)
   theory with the direct local sampling scheme. The FC wave functions were
   constructed based on the chemical formula theory (CFT), whose local
   characters correspond to the covalent dissociations: C+(P-2
   degrees(s(2)p))) + H(S-2) of the X-1 Sigma(+) and A(1)Pi states and the
   ionic dissociations: C(D-1(s(2)p(2))) + H+ of the C-1 Sigma(+) and D-1
   Pi states. All the calculated PECs were obtained with satisfying the
   chemical accuracy, i.e., error less than 1 kcal/mol, as absolute total
   energy of the Schrodinger equation without any energy shift. The
   spectroscopic data calculated from the PECs agreed well with both
   experimental and other accurate theoretical references. We also analyzed
   the wave functions using the inverse overlap weights proposed by Gallup
   et al. with the CFT configurations. For the X-1 Sigma(+) and A(1)Pi
   states, the covalent C+(sp2) and C+(p3) configurations played important
   roles for bond formation. In the small internuclear distances of the C-1
   Sigma(+), D-1 Pi, and 3(1)Sigma(+) states, the covalent character was
   also dominant as a result of the electron charge transfer from C to H+.
   Thus, the present FC-LSE results not only are accurate but also can
   provide chemical understanding according to the CFT.},
