abstract  ="The bond dissociation energy of methylidyne{,} D0(CH){,} is studied using an improved version of the High-Accuracy Extrapolated ab initio Thermochemistry (HEAT) approach as well as the Feller–Peterson–Dixon (FPD) model chemistry. These calculations{,} which include basis sets up to nonuple (aug-cc-pCV9Z) quality{,} are expected to be capable of providing results substantially more accurate than the ca. 1 kJ mol−1 level that is characteristic of standard high-accuracy protocols for computational thermochemistry. The calculated 0 K CH bond energy (27 954 ± 15 cm−1 for HEAT and 27 956 ± 15 cm−1 for FPD){,} along with equivalent treatments of the CH ionization energy and the CH+ dissociation energy (85 829 ± 15 cm−1 and 32 946 ± 15 cm−1{,} respectively){,} were compared to the existing benchmarks from Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT){,} uncovering an unexpected difference for D0(CH). This has prompted a detailed reexamination of the provenance of the corresponding ATcT benchmark{,} allowing the discovery and subsequent correction of a systematic error present in several published high-level calculations{,} ultimately yielding an amended ATcT benchmark for D0(CH). Finally{,} the current theoretical results were added to the ATcT Thermochemical Network{,} producing refined ATcT estimates of 27 957.3 ± 6.0 cm−1 for D0(CH){,} 32 946.7 ± 0.6 cm−1 for D0(CH+){,} and 85 831.0 ± 6.0 cm−1 for IE(CH)."

PAGES = {16--24},
ABSTRACT = {This work communicates cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) of methylidyne (CH) in a chemiluminescent plasma that is produced in a microwave cavity. Of interest are the rotational lines of the 0-0 vibrational transition for the A&ndash;X band and the 1-0 vibrational transition for the B&ndash;X band. The reported investigations originate from research on the CH radical in 1996, which constituted the first case of applying CRDS to the CH radical. The report also includes a recent analysis that shows excellent agreement of the measured and computed data, and it communicates CH line strength data. The CH radical is an important diatomic molecule in hydrocarbon combustion diagnosis and the analysis of stellar plasma emissions, to name just two examples of analytical plasma chemistry.},

Abstract = {Rotationally resolved spectra of the C-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi electronic
   system of the CH radical were measured using cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy in supersonically expanding, planar hydrocarbon plasma. The
   experimental conditions allowed the study of highly excited rotational

   vibronic bands in the ultraviolet between 30900 and 32400 cm(-1)
   (324-309 nm). The resulting data, compared to earlier measurements,
   allows for the determination of more precise molecular constants for
   each vibrational state and therefore more precise equilibrium values.
   From this an equilibrium bond length of 1.115798(17) angstrom for the
   C-2 Sigma(+) state is determined. A comprehensive list with observed

   the important role played by the CH features in the Bond-Neff feature
   depressing the spectra of barium stars by as much as 0.2 mag in the
   lambda = 3000-5500 angstrom range. Because of the extreme thermodynamic
   conditions prevailing in stellar atmospheres (compared to the

also features a dual spectrophotometer known as MAESTRO with wavelength coverage

arrays records images of the Sun at 0.525 and 1.02 μm. Working primarily in solar
occultation, the satellite provides altitude profile information (typically 10–100 km)
for temperature, pressure, and the volume mixing ratios for several dozen molecules
of atmospheric interest, as well as atmospheric extinction profiles over the
latitudes 85°N to 85°S. This paper presents a mission overview and some of the

pages = {399-418},
abstract = {Absorption spectra of CH and CD molecules have been studied in the
ultraviolet and vacuum ultra- violet by means of the flash photolysis of diazomethane.
The three Iaiown systems A-X, B-X, and C-X are fairly strong in absorption. Of
these the last two, B-X and C-X, have been extended. In par- ticular, in the B-X
system diffuseness of the higher rotational lines has been observed. This diffuseness
is a result of the predissociation previously derived from the breaking-off of
the rotational structure in emission. The difference in the predissociation limits
as observed in absorption and emission indicates the presence of a slight maximum
in the potential function of the B 2~- state, However, it appears that sufficient
tunneling at the base of the barrier arises for the predIssociation limit as observed
in emission to be equal to the dissociation limit, and as a result the dissociation
energy of CII (and CD) now in the literature is not appreciably changed by the
recognition of the potential maximum. The revised value is D00(CH) = 3.454 ± 0.012 eV.
A predissociation of the C 2~+ state was recognized early in this work and has
already been confirmed by the lifetime measurements of Hesser and Lutz. A number
of new electronic transitions have been found in the vacuum ultraviolet, including
a Rydberg series starting at 1370 A and yielding an ionization potential of 10.64 eV.
At longer wavelengths new electronic transitions D 2H1-X 211 E 211_x 211, F 2~+_x 2fl,
and D 211j-B 2~ occur at 1690, 1560, 1540, and 3007 A. The first two and the last
are clearly predissociated (diffuse) for all observed J-values, while the third
is predissociated for higher f-values. All vacuum-ultraviolet transitions are
likely to be of importance in stellar and interstellar spectra in this spectral
region. Moreover, the predissociations established in the C, D, and E states are
so strong that almost every light quantum beyond 3200 A absorbed by CHin the interstellar
medium will lead to its dissociation, thus greatly limiting the lifetime of a given CH molecule.},
