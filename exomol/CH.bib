TITLE = {Methylidyne Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy in a Microwave Plasma Discharge},
JOURNAL = {Foundations},
VOLUME = {3},
YEAR = {2023},
PAGES = {16--24},
ABSTRACT = {This work communicates cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) of methylidyne (CH) in a chemiluminescent plasma that is produced in a microwave cavity. Of interest are the rotational lines of the 0-0 vibrational transition for the A&ndash;X band and the 1-0 vibrational transition for the B&ndash;X band. The reported investigations originate from research on the CH radical in 1996, which constituted the first case of applying CRDS to the CH radical. The report also includes a recent analysis that shows excellent agreement of the measured and computed data, and it communicates CH line strength data. The CH radical is an important diatomic molecule in hydrocarbon combustion diagnosis and the analysis of stellar plasma emissions, to name just two examples of analytical plasma chemistry.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{272}},
Abstract = {{Effective potential energy curves of the ground electronic states of
   isotopomers of the methylidyne radical CH are constructed by morphing
   accurate ab initio potential energy curves within the framework of
   Jenc's reduced potential energy curve (RPC) approach. The morphing is
   performed by fitting the RPC parameters to available experimental
   ro-vibrational data. In turn, the resulting potential energy curves are
   used to determine the radial property functions describing the
   spin-orbit and fine and hyperfine energy patterns of the
   spin-ro-vibrational energy levels by morphing their ab initio
   approximants or by a direct fitting to experiment. The resulting
   functions enable reliable predicting outside prospected energy regions,
   and a quantitative probing of the impacts of external perturbations on
   the observed spectra. }},

Title = {{Cavity ring-down UV spectroscopy of the C-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi electronic
   transition of CH}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {360},
Pages = {15-23},
Abstract = {Rotationally resolved spectra of the C-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi electronic
   system of the CH radical were measured using cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy in supersonically expanding, planar hydrocarbon plasma. The
   experimental conditions allowed the study of highly excited rotational
   levels starting from vibrationally excited states. Here we present some
   200+ new or more accurately recorded transitions in the 0-0, 1-1 and 2-2
   vibronic bands in the ultraviolet between 30900 and 32400 cm(-1)
   (324-309 nm). The resulting data, compared to earlier measurements,
   allows for the determination of more precise molecular constants for
   each vibrational state and therefore more precise equilibrium values.
   From this an equilibrium bond length of 1.115798(17) angstrom for the
   C-2 Sigma(+) state is determined. A comprehensive list with observed
   transitions for each band has been compiled from all available
   experimental studies and constraints are placed on the predissociation
   lifetimes. },

Volume = {571},
pages = {A47},
Abstract = {The advent of high-resolution spectrographs and detailed stellar
   atmosphere modelling has strengthened the need for accurate molecular
   data. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars spectra are interesting
   objects with which to study transitions from the CH molecule. We combine
   programs for spectral analysis of molecules and stellar-radiative
   transfer codes to build an extensive CH linelist, including
   predissociation broadening as well as newly identified levels. We show
   examples of strong predissociation CH lines in CEMP stars, and we stress
   the important role played by the CH features in the Bond-Neff feature
   depressing the spectra of barium stars by as much as 0.2 mag in the
   lambda = 3000-5500 angstrom range. Because of the extreme thermodynamic
   conditions prevailing in stellar atmospheres (compared to the
   laboratory), molecular transitions with high energy levels can be
   observed. Stellar spectra can thus be used to constrain and improve
   molecular data.},

The primary ACE instrument is a high spectral resolution (0.02 cm−1) Fourier Transform
Spectrometer (FTS) operating from 2.2 to 13.3 μm (750–4400 cm−1). The satellite
also features a dual spectrophotometer known as MAESTRO with wavelength coverage
of 285–1030 nm and spectral resolution of 1–2 nm. A pair of filtered CMOS detector
arrays records images of the Sun at 0.525 and 1.02 μm. Working primarily in solar
occultation, the satellite provides altitude profile information (typically 10–100 km)
for temperature, pressure, and the volume mixing ratios for several dozen molecules
of atmospheric interest, as well as atmospheric extinction profiles over the
latitudes 85°N to 85°S. This paper presents a mission overview and some of the
first scientific results.},

beam is resonant with a selected A−X transition. Six branches of the C−X system
are spectrally resolved for the first time; in total 124 lines detected in this
work correspond to excitation of the C state up to N' = 23. Observed wavenumbers

These data are combined with lines of C−X (0−0) and (2−2) bands to provide improved
characterization of the C state of CH. For all lines of the C−X (1−1) band, the
line widths are nearly identical. Predissociation mechanisms of the C state are discussed.},

the 1–0 band of the B 2Σ⎯–X 2Π system to access rotational quantum number N′ up
to 21 and 13 of v′=0 and 1 in the B 2Σ⎯ state, respectively. Inclusion of additional
line positions measured for the 0–0 and the 1–0 bands yields spectral parameters
of the B 2Σ⎯ state significantly improved over those obtained previously with only
nonpredissociative lines; one additional centrifugal–distortion parameter Lv is
evaluated significantly. Although power saturation is significant even at smallest
practical laser energies, we estimated lifetimes through the power dependence of
linewidths. The lifetimes of the highest measurable level of B 2Σ⎯ (v′=0 and 1)

of the ATMOS spectrum of CH for determining the molecular parameters we found total
interparameter correlations between some of them, due to the absence of high-J
lines of the P and Q branches. With the help of the precise constants obtained
from our 0-0 band measurements (12 branches with Jmax = 24.5, f = 181, σ = 0.0025 cm−1)
of the $A\ ^2\Delta - X\ ^2\Pi$ transition, we have been able to remove the correlations
and obtain more accurate molecular parameters for the X2Π ground state. These
constants have subsequently been used to derive new exact molecular parameters
for the $A\ ^2\Delta$ , $\nu$ = 1, 2, and 3 levels of CH. The $\Lambda$-doubling
constants in the $A\ ^2\Delta$ state were obtained for the first time. The complex
vibrational analysis has been carried out to determine the equilibrium molecular

combining states, as well as Franck-Condon factors for the A-X system.},

title = {{New spectra of the CH molecule}},
journal = ApJ,
year = {1969},
volume = {158},
pages = {399-418},
abstract = {Absorption spectra of CH and CD molecules have been studied in the
ultraviolet and vacuum ultra- violet by means of the flash photolysis of diazomethane.
The three Iaiown systems A-X, B-X, and C-X are fairly strong in absorption. Of
these the last two, B-X and C-X, have been extended. In par- ticular, in the B-X
system diffuseness of the higher rotational lines has been observed. This diffuseness
is a result of the predissociation previously derived from the breaking-off of
the rotational structure in emission. The difference in the predissociation limits
as observed in absorption and emission indicates the presence of a slight maximum
in the potential function of the B 2~- state, However, it appears that sufficient
tunneling at the base of the barrier arises for the predIssociation limit as observed
in emission to be equal to the dissociation limit, and as a result the dissociation
energy of CII (and CD) now in the literature is not appreciably changed by the
recognition of the potential maximum. The revised value is D00(CH) = 3.454 ± 0.012 eV.
A predissociation of the C 2~+ state was recognized early in this work and has
already been confirmed by the lifetime measurements of Hesser and Lutz. A number
of new electronic transitions have been found in the vacuum ultraviolet, including
a Rydberg series starting at 1370 A and yielding an ionization potential of 10.64 eV.
At longer wavelengths new electronic transitions D 2H1-X 211 E 211_x 211, F 2~+_x 2fl,
and D 211j-B 2~ occur at 1690, 1560, 1540, and 3007 A. The first two and the last
are clearly predissociated (diffuse) for all observed J-values, while the third
is predissociated for higher f-values. All vacuum-ultraviolet transitions are
likely to be of importance in stellar and interstellar spectra in this spectral
region. Moreover, the predissociations established in the C, D, and E states are
so strong that almost every light quantum beyond 3200 A absorbed by CHin the interstellar
medium will lead to its dissociation, thus greatly limiting the lifetime of a given CH molecule.},
