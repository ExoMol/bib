Title = {{An ab initio study of the rovibronic spectra of CH}},
Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2024},
Abstract = {CH is one of the most spectroscopically studied diatomic molecules. The
   rovibronic spectra of the methylidyne radical (CH) in adiabatic and
   diabatic representations are obtained based on ab initio data, including
   12 potential energy curves, 38 dipole moment curves, 79 spin-orbit
   coupling curves, and 18 electronic angular momentum coupling curves. We
   employed the internally contracted multireference configuration
   interaction method including the Davidson correction with the
   aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z basis set for the C atom and the aug-cc-pV5Z basis set
   for the H atom. The diabatic transformations are performed based on a
   property-based diabatisation method to remove the avoided crossings for
   the E 2 Pi-F 2 Pi and F 2 Pi-H 2 Pi pairs. The coupled nuclear motion
   Schr \& ouml;dinger equations are then solved using the Duo nuclear
   motion program to obtain the rovibronic spectra of CH for wavenumbers
   from 0 to 80 000 cm-1 at 5000 K. An overall prediction of the rovibronic
   spectra of CH is provided in this work. Our results could be beneficial
   for future calculations of rovibronic spectra of CH and contribute to
   improving astronomical, chemical, and physical models.},

ABSTRACT = {This work communicates cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) of methylidyne (CH) in a chemiluminescent plasma that is produced in a microwave cavity. Of interest are the rotational lines of the 0-0 vibrational transition for the A&ndash;X band and the 1-0 vibrational transition for the B&ndash;X band. The reported investigations originate from research on the CH radical in 1996, which constituted the first case of applying CRDS to the CH radical. The report also includes a recent analysis that shows excellent agreement of the measured and computed data, and it communicates CH line strength data. The CH radical is an important diatomic molecule in hydrocarbon combustion diagnosis and the analysis of stellar plasma emissions, to name just two examples of analytical plasma chemistry.},

Abstract = {Rotationally resolved spectra of the C-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi electronic

   vibronic bands in the ultraviolet between 30900 and 32400 cm(-1)

   allows for the determination of more precise molecular constants for
   each vibrational state and therefore more precise equilibrium values.
   From this an equilibrium bond length of 1.115798(17) angstrom for the

   predissociation broadening as well as newly identified levels. We show
   examples of strong predissociation CH lines in CEMP stars, and we stress
   the important role played by the CH features in the Bond-Neff feature
   depressing the spectra of barium stars by as much as 0.2 mag in the
   lambda = 3000-5500 angstrom range. Because of the extreme thermodynamic
   conditions prevailing in stellar atmospheres (compared to the
   laboratory), molecular transitions with high energy levels can be
   observed. Stellar spectra can thus be used to constrain and improve
   molecular data.},

occultation, the satellite provides altitude profile information (typically 10–100 km)
for temperature, pressure, and the volume mixing ratios for several dozen molecules
of atmospheric interest, as well as atmospheric extinction profiles over the

abstract = {Absorption spectra of CH and CD molecules have been studied in the
ultraviolet and vacuum ultra- violet by means of the flash photolysis of diazomethane.
The three Iaiown systems A-X, B-X, and C-X are fairly strong in absorption. Of
these the last two, B-X and C-X, have been extended. In par- ticular, in the B-X
system diffuseness of the higher rotational lines has been observed. This diffuseness
is a result of the predissociation previously derived from the breaking-off of
the rotational structure in emission. The difference in the predissociation limits
as observed in absorption and emission indicates the presence of a slight maximum
in the potential function of the B 2~- state, However, it appears that sufficient
tunneling at the base of the barrier arises for the predIssociation limit as observed
in emission to be equal to the dissociation limit, and as a result the dissociation
energy of CII (and CD) now in the literature is not appreciably changed by the
recognition of the potential maximum. The revised value is D00(CH) = 3.454 ± 0.012 eV.
A predissociation of the C 2~+ state was recognized early in this work and has
already been confirmed by the lifetime measurements of Hesser and Lutz. A number
of new electronic transitions have been found in the vacuum ultraviolet, including
a Rydberg series starting at 1370 A and yielding an ionization potential of 10.64 eV.
At longer wavelengths new electronic transitions D 2H1-X 211 E 211_x 211, F 2~+_x 2fl,
and D 211j-B 2~ occur at 1690, 1560, 1540, and 3007 A. The first two and the last
are clearly predissociated (diffuse) for all observed J-values, while the third
is predissociated for higher f-values. All vacuum-ultraviolet transitions are
likely to be of importance in stellar and interstellar spectra in this spectral
region. Moreover, the predissociations established in the C, D, and E states are
so strong that almost every light quantum beyond 3200 A absorbed by CHin the interstellar
medium will lead to its dissociation, thus greatly limiting the lifetime of a given CH molecule.},
