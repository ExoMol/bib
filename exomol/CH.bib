Abstract = {{Rotationally resolved spectra of the C-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi electronic
   system of the CH radical were measured using cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy in supersonically expanding, planar hydrocarbon plasma. The
   experimental conditions allowed the study of highly excited rotational
   levels starting from vibrationally excited states. Here we present some
   200+ new or more accurately recorded transitions in the 0-0, 1-1 and 2-2
   vibronic bands in the ultraviolet between 30900 and 32400 cm(-1)
   (324-309 nm). The resulting data, compared to earlier measurements,
   allows for the determination of more precise molecular constants for
   each vibrational state and therefore more precise equilibrium values.
   From this an equilibrium bond length of 1.115798(17) angstrom for the
   C-2 Sigma(+) state is determined. A comprehensive list with observed
   transitions for each band has been compiled from all available
   experimental studies and constraints are placed on the predissociation
   lifetimes. }},

Abstract = {{The advent of high-resolution spectrographs and detailed stellar
   atmosphere modelling has strengthened the need for accurate molecular
   data. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars spectra are interesting
   objects with which to study transitions from the CH molecule. We combine
   programs for spectral analysis of molecules and stellar-radiative
   transfer codes to build an extensive CH linelist, including
   predissociation broadening as well as newly identified levels. We show
   examples of strong predissociation CH lines in CEMP stars, and we stress
   the important role played by the CH features in the Bond-Neff feature
   depressing the spectra of barium stars by as much as 0.2 mag in the
   lambda = 3000-5500 angstrom range. Because of the extreme thermodynamic
   conditions prevailing in stellar atmospheres (compared to the
   laboratory), molecular transitions with high energy levels can be
   observed. Stellar spectra can thus be used to constrain and improve
   molecular data.}},
