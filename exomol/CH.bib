Abstract = {{Rotationally resolved spectra of the C-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi electronic
   system of the CH radical were measured using cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy in supersonically expanding, planar hydrocarbon plasma. The
   experimental conditions allowed the study of highly excited rotational
   levels starting from vibrationally excited states. Here we present some
   200+ new or more accurately recorded transitions in the 0-0, 1-1 and 2-2
   vibronic bands in the ultraviolet between 30900 and 32400 cm(-1)
   (324-309 nm). The resulting data, compared to earlier measurements,
   allows for the determination of more precise molecular constants for
   each vibrational state and therefore more precise equilibrium values.
   From this an equilibrium bond length of 1.115798(17) angstrom for the
   C-2 Sigma(+) state is determined. A comprehensive list with observed
   transitions for each band has been compiled from all available
   experimental studies and constraints are placed on the predissociation
   lifetimes. }},

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{571}},
pages = {A47},
Abstract = {{The advent of high-resolution spectrographs and detailed stellar
   atmosphere modelling has strengthened the need for accurate molecular
   data. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars spectra are interesting
   objects with which to study transitions from the CH molecule. We combine
   programs for spectral analysis of molecules and stellar-radiative
   transfer codes to build an extensive CH linelist, including
   predissociation broadening as well as newly identified levels. We show
   examples of strong predissociation CH lines in CEMP stars, and we stress
   the important role played by the CH features in the Bond-Neff feature
   depressing the spectra of barium stars by as much as 0.2 mag in the
   lambda = 3000-5500 angstrom range. Because of the extreme thermodynamic
   conditions prevailing in stellar atmospheres (compared to the
   laboratory), molecular transitions with high energy levels can be
   observed. Stellar spectra can thus be used to constrain and improve
   molecular data.}},

  abstract={SCISAT-1, also known as the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), is a Canadian satellite mission for remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere. It was launched into low Earth circular orbit (altitude 650 km, inclination 74°) on 12 Aug. 2003. The primary ACE instrument is a high spectral resolution (0.02 cm−1) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) operating from 2.2 to 13.3 μm (750–4400 cm−1). The satellite also features a dual spectrophotometer known as MAESTRO with wavelength coverage of 285–1030 nm and spectral resolution of 1–2 nm. A pair of filtered CMOS detector arrays records images of the Sun at 0.525 and 1.02 μm. Working primarily in solar occultation, the satellite provides altitude profile information (typically 10–100 km) for temperature, pressure, and the volume mixing ratios for several dozen molecules of atmospheric interest, as well as atmospheric extinction profiles over the latitudes 85°N to 85°S. This paper presents a mission overview and some of the first scientific results.},

Six branches of the C−X system are spectrally resolved for the first time; in total 124 lines detected in this work correspond to excitation of the C state up to N' = 23. Observed wavenumbers are fitted to yield improved spectral parameters of the $C\ ^2\Sigma^+$ (v = 1) state; one additional centrifugal distortion parameter LV is evaluated significantly. These data are combined with lines of C−X (0−0) and (2−2) bands to provide improved characterization of the C state of CH. For all lines of the C−X (1−1) band, the line widths are nearly identical. Predissociation mechanisms of the C state are discussed.},

The probe and grating wavelengths are in resonance with the A 2Δ–X 2Π and B 2Σ⎯–X 2Π systems, respectively. We measured 49 previously unobserved rovibronic lines of the 0–0 band and 38 additional lines of the 1–0 band of the B 2Σ⎯–X 2Π system to access rotational quantum number N′ up to 21 and 13 of v′=0 and 1 in the B 2Σ⎯ state, respectively. Inclusion of additional line positions measured for the 0–0 and the 1–0 bands yields spectral parameters of the B 2Σ⎯ state significantly improved over those obtained previously with only nonpredissociative lines; one additional centrifugal–distortion parameter Lv is evaluated significantly. Although power saturation is significant even at smallest practical laser energies, we estimated lifetimes through the power dependence of linewidths. The lifetimes of the highest measurable level of B 2Σ⎯ (v′=0 and 1) are 3±1 (N′=20) and 8±2 (N′=11) ps, respectively.},

  abstract={Seven bands of the $A\ ^2\Delta - X\ ^2\Pi$ system of the CH radical have been photographed in emission from a Geissler tube using conventional spectroscopic techniques. Under high resolution and using Th lines as standards, as well as an interferometric comparator equipped with a photoelectric scanning device, the 0-0, 1-1, 2-2, 0-1, and 1-2 bands have been rephotographed and the 3-3 and 2-3 bands, with a total number of 144 lines, have been recorded for the first time. In the previously reported (J. Mol. Spectrosc.134, 305, 1989; 147, 16, 1991) evaluation of the ATMOS spectrum of CH for determining the molecular parameters we found total interparameter correlations between some of them, due to the absence of high-J lines of the P and Q branches. With the help of the precise constants obtained from our 0-0 band measurements (12 branches with Jmax = 24.5, f = 181, σ = 0.0025 cm−1) of the $A\ ^2\Delta - X\ ^2\Pi$ transition, we have been able to remove the correlations and obtain more accurate molecular parameters for the X2Π ground state. These constants have subsequently been used to derive new exact molecular parameters for the $A\ ^2\Delta$ , $\nu$ = 1, 2, and 3 levels of CH. The $\Lambda$-doubling constants in the $A\ ^2\Delta$ state were obtained for the first time. The complex vibrational analysis has been carried out to determine the equilibrium molecular constants. Also, RKR potentials and r-centroids have been calculated for both the combining states, as well as Franck-Condon factors for the A-X system.},

  abstract={Absorption spectra of CH and CD molecules have been studied in the ultraviolet and vacuum ultra- violet by means of the flash photolysis of diazomethane. The three Iaiown systems A-X, B-X, and C-X are fairly strong in absorption. Of these the last two, B-X and C-X, have been extended. In par- ticular, in the B-X system diffuseness of the higher rotational lines has been observed. This diffuseness is a result of the predissociation previously derived from the breaking-off of the rotational structure in emission. The difference in the predissociation limits as observed in absorption and emission indicates the presence of a slight maximum in the potential function of the B 2~- state, However, it appears that sufficient tunneling at the base of the barrier arises for the predIssociation limit as observed in emission to be equal to the dissociation limit, and as a result the dissociation energy of CII (and CD) now in the literature is not appreciably changed by the recognition of the potential maximum. The revised value is D00(CH) = 3.454 ± 0.012 eV. A predissociation of the C 2~+ state was recognized early in this work and has already been confirmed by the lifetime measurements of Hesser and Lutz. A number of new electronic transitions have been found in the vacuum ultraviolet, including a Rydberg series starting at 1370 A and yielding an ionization potential of 10.64 eV. At longer wavelengths new electronic transitions D 2H1-X 211 E 211_x 211, F 2~+_x 2fl, and D 211j-B 2~ occur at 1690, 1560, 1540, and 3007 A. The first two and the last are clearly predissociated (diffuse) for all observed J-values, while the third is predissociated for higher f-values. All vacuum-ultraviolet transitions are likely to be of importance in stellar and interstellar spectra in this spectral region. Moreover, the predissociations established in the C, D, and E states are so strong that almost every light quantum beyond 3200 A absorbed by CHin the interstellar medium will lead to its dissociation, thus greatly limiting the lifetime of a given CH molecule.},
