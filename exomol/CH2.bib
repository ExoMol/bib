Title = {{Accurate ab initio potential energy surface, rovibrational energy levels
   and resonance interactions of triplet
   ((<i>X</i>)over-tilde<SUP>3</SUP><i>B</i><sub>1</sub>) methylene}},
Journal =JCC,
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {In this work, we report rovibrational energy levels for four
   isotopologues of methylene (CH2, CHD, CD2, and (CH2)-C-13) in their
   ground triplet electronic state ((X) over tilde B-3(1)) from variational
   calculation up to similar to 10,000 cm(-1) and using a new accurate ab
   initio potential energy surface (PES). Triplet methylene exhibits a
   large-amplitude bending vibration and can reach a quasilinear
   configuration due to its low barrier (similar to 2000 cm(-1)). To
   construct the ab initio PES, the Dunning's augmented
   correlation-consistent core valence orbital basis sets were employed up
   to the sextuple-zeta quality {[}aug-cc-pCVXZ, X = T, Q, 5, and 6]
   combined with the single-and double-excitation unrestricted coupled
   cluster approach with a perturbative treatment of triple excitations
   {[}RHF-UCCSD(T)]. We have shown that the accuracy of the ab initio
   energies is further improved by including the corrections due to the
   scalar relativistic effects, DBOC and high-order electronic
   correlations. For the first time, all the available experimental
   rovibrational transitions were reproduced with errors less than 0.12
   cm(-1), without any empirical corrections. Unlike more ``traditional{''}
   nonlinear triatomic molecules, we have shown that even the energies of
   the ground vibrational state (000) with rather small rotational quantum
   numbers are strongly affected by the very pronounced rovibrational
   resonance interactions. Accordingly, the polyad structure of the
   vibrational levels of CH2 and CD2 was analyzed and discussed. The
   comparison between the energy levels obtained from the effective Watson
   A-reduced Hamiltonian, from the generating function approach and from a
   variational calculation was given.},

Title = {New Theoretical Infrared Line List for the Methyl Radical with Accurate
   Vibrational Band Origins from High-Level Ab Initio Calculations},
Journal = JCPA,
Year = {2022},
Abstract = {In the present work, high-level ab initio calculations were carried out
   for the ground electronic state of the methyl radical (CH3). Dunning's
   augmented correlation-consistent orbital basis sets were employed up to
   the quintuple-zeta valence quality with the core-valence electron
   correlation {[}aug-cc-pCV5Z] combined with the single-and
   double-excitation unrestricted coupled-cluster approach with a
   perturbative treatment of triple excitations {[}RHF-UCCSD(T)]. The
   explicitly correlated version of the coupled-cluster approach
   {[}RHF-UCCSD(T)-F12x\{x = a, b\}] was additionally applied with the
   core-valence cc-pCVQZ-F12 basis set in order to study convergence with
   respect to the basis set size. The contributions beyond the
   coupled-cluster level of the theory like Douglas-Kroll-Hess scalar
   relativistic Hamiltonian, diabatic Born-Oppenheimer corrections, and
   high-order electronic correlations have been included into the ab initio
   potential energy surfaces (PESs). It is shown that the theoretical band
   origins of CH3 converge gradually to the experimental values when
   applying the ab initio PESs using the aug-cc-pCVXZ {[}X = T, Q, and 5]
   basis sets. For the first time, all available experimental band origins
   of the gaseous CH3 are reproduced within an accuracy of 0.2 cm(-1) using
   a newly developed PES extrapolated to the complete basis set limit
   {[}CBS(TQ5Z)]. The reached accuracy is one order of magnitude better
   than that of the best available calculations. A new theoretical infrared
   line list was generated for astrophysical applications using an ab
   initio dipole moment surface computed at the RHF-UCCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCVQZ
   level of the theory. The manifestation of a large-amplitude motion in
   CH3 is also discussed.},

  title = {{A theoretical study of the absorption spectrum of singlet CH2}},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {517},
  pages = {247-264},
  abstract = {This paper is a continuation of our earlier work aimed at characterizing
	the electronic states of the methylene free radical CH2. In the present
	paper we focus attention on the lowest pair of singlet states, (a)
	over tilde(1)A(1) and (b) over tilde(1)B(1). These states are degenerate
	when they are linear and therefore participate in a Renner interaction.
	Our previous refinement of the (a) over tilde state potential energy
	surface ignored the Renner effect. Now we include this effect and
	refine both the potential energy surfaces by a fitting of the data.
	Using these two new potential energy surfaces, allowing for the Renner
	effect, and making an ab initio calculation of the dipole moment
	surfaces and transition moment surface, we make a simulation of the
	absorption spectrum associated with this pair of interacting electronic
	states. These predictions have been of use for the assignment of
	the spectrum. Further experimental work aimed at identifying rotational
	levels belonging to the vibrational ground state of the (b) over
	tilde stare is necessary before we can consider better refinements
	of the potential surfaces. Also spectra that fill other gaps in the
	data available for the two states would be highly desirable. One
	important new feature to emerge is that the adiabatic Renner effect
	correction A(L-z(2)) to the (a) over tilde-state potential energy
	surface causes a significant increase in the energy of the (a) over
	tilde state; this means that the experimentally derived vibrationless
	singlet-triplet splitting in methylene, T-e((a) over tilde), is reduced
	by 64 cm(-1) to 3159 cm(-1). This is essentially in perfect agreement
	with the best theoretical value for this quantity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

abstract = "The present paper describes a method for calculating the linestrengths and (if the molecules are in thermal equilibrium) absolute intensities for triatomic molecules using the rotation-vibration energies and wavefunctions obtained in the \{MORBID\} (Morse oscillator rigid bender internal dynamics) approach [P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 128, 478–501 (1988)] together with ab initio dipole moment values. A computer program that carries out these calculations has been written and used to compute the rotation-vibration spectrum of X̃3B1 12CH2 in the wavenumber region around 1000 cm−1, containing the observed ν2 fundamental band [M. D. Marshall and A. R. W. McKellar, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 3716–3723 (1986), and references therein], and around 3000 cm−1, where the stretching fundamental bands ν1 and ν3 are found together with the 3ν2 band. No transitions belonging to these latter bands have been observed and one of the aims of the present work is to provide the best possible theoretical predictions to guide the experimental search for them. It is found that the strongest transition in the region around 3000 cm−1 is the ν3 514 ← 413 line calculated to have a frequency of 3285.49 cm−1 and an integrated intensity of 1.04 × 103 mole−1 cm at an absolute temperature of 293 K. The integrated intensity of this line is about half of the integrated intensity of the weakest ν2 transition observed, the 523 ← 532 line observed at 910.1660 cm−1. Even when the decrease in peak absorption due to Doppler line broadening is taken into account, it should not be entirely out of the question to observe at least stronger ν3 lines. "
