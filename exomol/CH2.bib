  abstract = {This paper is a continuation of our earlier work aimed at characterizing
	the electronic states of the methylene free radical CH2. In the present
	paper we focus attention on the lowest pair of singlet states, (a)
	over tilde(1)A(1) and (b) over tilde(1)B(1). These states are degenerate
	when they are linear and therefore participate in a Renner interaction.
	Our previous refinement of the (a) over tilde state potential energy
	surface ignored the Renner effect. Now we include this effect and
	refine both the potential energy surfaces by a fitting of the data.
	Using these two new potential energy surfaces, allowing for the Renner
	effect, and making an ab initio calculation of the dipole moment
	surfaces and transition moment surface, we make a simulation of the
	absorption spectrum associated with this pair of interacting electronic
	states. These predictions have been of use for the assignment of
	the spectrum. Further experimental work aimed at identifying rotational
	levels belonging to the vibrational ground state of the (b) over
	tilde stare is necessary before we can consider better refinements
	of the potential surfaces. Also spectra that fill other gaps in the
	data available for the two states would be highly desirable. One
	important new feature to emerge is that the adiabatic Renner effect
	correction A(L-z(2)) to the (a) over tilde-state potential energy
	surface causes a significant increase in the energy of the (a) over
	tilde state; this means that the experimentally derived vibrationless
	singlet-triplet splitting in methylene, T-e((a) over tilde), is reduced
	by 64 cm(-1) to 3159 cm(-1). This is essentially in perfect agreement
	with the best theoretical value for this quantity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

We adjust the shape of the potential surface used in the calculation in order to optimize the fit of the calculated energy level separations to the 61 available experimental values for these three isotopes of methylene. In the fit we vary nine parameters and determine, among other things, that the equilibrium bond length is 1.0748Â±0.0004 Ã<85>, the equilibrium bond angle is 133.84Â°Â±0.05Â°, the height of the barrier to linearity is 1940Â±80 cmâ<88><92>1, and the optimum bond length for the molecule when it is linear, at the saddle point in the potential surface, is 1.060Â±0.005 Ã<85>. From our results we predict the stretching frequencies in 12CH2 to be Î½1=2950Â±40 cmâ<88><92>1 and Î½3=3080Â±40 cmâ<88><92>1. }

abstract = "The present paper describes a method for calculating the linestrengths and (if the molecules are in thermal equilibrium) absolute intensities for triatomic molecules using the rotation-vibration energies and wavefunctions obtained in the \{MORBID\} (Morse oscillator rigid bender internal dynamics) approach [P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 128, 478–501 (1988)] together with ab initio dipole moment values. A computer program that carries out these calculations has been written and used to compute the rotation-vibration spectrum of X̃3B1 12CH2 in the wavenumber region around 1000 cm−1, containing the observed ν2 fundamental band [M. D. Marshall and A. R. W. McKellar, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 3716–3723 (1986), and references therein], and around 3000 cm−1, where the stretching fundamental bands ν1 and ν3 are found together with the 3ν2 band. No transitions belonging to these latter bands have been observed and one of the aims of the present work is to provide the best possible theoretical predictions to guide the experimental search for them. It is found that the strongest transition in the region around 3000 cm−1 is the ν3 514 ← 413 line calculated to have a frequency of 3285.49 cm−1 and an integrated intensity of 1.04 × 103 mole−1 cm at an absolute temperature of 293 K. The integrated intensity of this line is about half of the integrated intensity of the weakest ν2 transition observed, the 523 ← 532 line observed at 910.1660 cm−1. Even when the decrease in peak absorption due to Doppler line broadening is taken into account, it should not be entirely out of the question to observe at least stronger ν3 lines. "
