Abstract = {CH3+, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently
   been detected for the first time by using the James Webb Space
   Telescope. The photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate
   explicitly correlated multi-reference configuration interaction ab
   initio calculations are done, and full-dimensional potential energy
   surfaces are developed for the three lower electronic states, with a
   fundamental invariant neural network method. The photodissociation cross
   section is calculated using a full-dimensional quantum wave packet
   method in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The wave packet is represented
   in angular and radial grids, allowing us to reduce the number of points
   physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious states
   appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through projection
   technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in astrochemical
   models to simulate the conditions of the Orion bar, result in a lesser
   destruction of CH3+ compared to that obtained when utilizing the
   recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry.},

title={{Formation of the methyl cation by photochemistry in a protoplanetary disk}},
journal={Nature},
year={2023},
abstract={Forty years ago, it was proposed that gas-phase organic chemistry in the interstellar medium can be initiated by the methyl cation CH3+ (refs. 1--3), but so far it has not been observed outside the Solar System4,5. Alternative routes involving processes on grain surfaces have been invoked6,7. Here we report James Webb Space Telescope observations of CH3+ in a protoplanetary disk in the Orion star-forming region. We find that gas-phase organic chemistry is activated by ultraviolet irradiation.},
