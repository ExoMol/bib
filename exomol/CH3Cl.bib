abstract = {We performed the systematic measurements of line intensities of ro-vibrational absorption transitions of the $\nu_3$ and $2\nu_3-\nu_3$
parallel bands of 12CH335Cl and 12CH337Cl isotopes. The spectra were recorded in the spectral region between 650 and 800 cm-1 with
a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer. A mono-spectrum fitting technique was used to fit a series of seven spectra at
pressures of CH3Cl ranging from 1.02 to 10.24 mbar to retrieve line intensities of 2385 transitions of the two
isotopic species. The measured line intensities are discussed in relation to rotational quantum numbers, and used to derive
the square of the transition dipole moments for each line. The analysis of these moments allows us to derive a consistent set of
line intensity parameters, such as vibrational transition moments, band intensities as well as Herman-Wallis coefficients for both bands.
The results of the \nu_3 band are in satisfactory agreement with previous works and present databases, but a larger discrepancy
(~ 30%) is observed for the $2\nu_3-\nu_3$ hot band.}

abstract = {Organohalogens, a class of molecules that contain at least one halogen atom
bonded to carbon, are abundant on the Earth where they are mainly produced through
industrial and biological processes. Consequently, they have been proposed as
biomarkers in the search for life on exoplanets. Simple halogen hydrides have been
detected in interstellar sources and in comets, but the presence and possible
incorporation of more complex halogen-containing molecules such as organohalogens
into planet-forming regions is uncertain. Here we report the interstellar detection
of two isotopologues of the organohalogen CH3Cl and put some constraints on CH3F
in the gas surrounding the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293â€“2422, using the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We also find CH3Cl in the coma of
comet 67P/Churyumovâ€“Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) by using the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer
for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument. The detections reveal an efficient
pre-planetary formation pathway of organohalogens. Cometary impacts may deliver these
species to young planets and should thus be included as a potential abiotical production
when interpreting future organohalogen detections in atmospheres of rocky planets.},

Abstract = {Two new nine-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) have been
 generated using high-level ab initio theory for the two main
 isotopologues of methyl chloride, (CH3Cl)-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-Cl-37. The
 respective PESs, CBS-35(HL), and CBS-37(HL), are based on explicitly
 correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the
 complete basis set (CBS) limit, and incorporate a range of higher-level
 (HL) additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron
 correlation, higher-order coupled cluster terms, scalar relativistic
 effects, and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections. Variational
 calculations of the vibrational energy levels were performed using the
 computer program TROVE, whose functionality has been extended to handle
 molecules of the form XY(3)Z. Fully converged energies were obtained by
 means of a complete vibrational basis set extrapolation. The CBS-35(HL)
 and CBS-37(HL) PESs reproduce the fundamental term values with
 root-mean-square errors of 0.75 and 1.00 cm(-1), respectively. An
 analysis of the combined effect of the HL corrections and CBS
 extrapolation on the vibrational wavenumbers indicates that both are
 needed to compute accurate theoretical results for methyl chloride. We
 believe that it would be extremely challenging to go beyond the accuracy
 currently achieved for CH3Cl without empirical refinement of the
 respective PESs. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {We demonstrate the potential of infrared degenerate four-wave mixing
 (IR-DFWM) as a tool for non-intrusive in situ spatially resolved
 detection of CH3Cl in reactive hot gas flows especially feasible for
 applications to biomass combustion and gasification. IR-DFWM spectra of
 CH3Cl, by probing ro-vibrational transitions belonging to the
 fundamental stretching modes v(1) and v(4), have been successfully
 recorded in gas flows diluted with nitrogen at atmospheric pressure and
 elevated temperatures up to 820K. In order to identify the spectral
 lines of CH3Cl, the recorded IR-DFWM spectra are compared with
 simulations using molecular parameters extracted from the HITRAN
 database. The potential interference from water vapor is discussed from
 measurements of H2O spectrum at 820K combined with simulations of H2O
 IR-DFWM spectrum based on the HITEMP database, and it was found that the
 (Q)Q(6) line of the v(1) band is relatively free from water interference
 at elevated temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, the detection limits
 for temperatures at 296, 550 and 820K were estimated to be 2.1, 3.1 and
 6.2 (x10(15) molecules/cm(3)), respectively, by scanning the (Q)Q(6)

 present work is focused on measurements of N-2-broadening coefficients

 Bruker IFS 120 HR interferometer at LADIR. The N-2-broadening
 coefficients have been retrieved using a Voigt profile and a
 multispectrum fitting procedure. The average accuracy of the
 N2-broadening obtained in this work has been estimated to be between 5\%
 and 10\% depending on the transitions. The rotational J- and
 K-dependences of the N-2-broadening coefficients have been clearly
 observed and modeled using empirical polynomial expansions. The
 (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-35-N-2 line-widths of the nu(5) band have also been
 computed using a semi-classical approach for the R-P, R-R and R-Q

Title = {Biosignature gases in {H}$_2$-dominated atmospheres on rocky exoplanets},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2013},
Number = {2},
Pages = {95},
Volume = {777},
Abstract = {Super-Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency
and some will be able to retain stable H-2-dominated atmospheres. We study biosignature
gases on exoplanets with thin H-2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures,
using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate framework for
evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates. We find that
photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H-2 atmospheres.
In atmospheres with high CO2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species
for some molecules. In Sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some
cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The
lower UV fluxes from UV-quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H
(or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate.
The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulate detectable biosignature
gases in an H-2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres,
where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential
biosignature gases, such as dimethylsulfide and CH3Cl, are therefore more favorable
in low-UV, as compared with solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature
gas candidates, including NH3 and N2O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments,
as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more
subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated
forms of an element, such as CH4 and H2S, are not effective signs of life in an
H-2-rich atmosphere because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such
gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature
gases in H-2-rich atmospheres for super-Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could
potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2013},
Number = {2},
Pages = {104},
Volume = {775},
Abstract = {Biosignature gas detection is one of the ultimate future goals for
exoplanet atmosphere studies. We have created a framework for linking biosignature
gas detectability to biomass estimates, including atmospheric photochemistry and
biological thermodynamics. The new framework is intended to liberate predictive
atmosphere models from requiring fixed, Earth-like biosignature gas source fluxes.
New biosignature gases can be considered with a check that the biomass estimate is
physically plausible. We have validated the models on terrestrial production of NO,
H2S, CH4, CH3Cl, and DMS. We have applied the models to propose NH3 as a biosignature
gas on a ``cold Haber World,{''} a planet with a N-2-H-2 atmosphere, and to demonstrate
why gases such as CH3Cl must have too large of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature
gas on planets with Earth or early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a Sun-like star.
To construct the biomass models, we developed a functional classification of biosignature
gases, and found that gases (such as CH4, H2S, and N2O) produced from life that extracts
energy from chemical potential energy gradients will always have false positives because
geochemistry has the same gases to work with as life does, and gases (such as DMS and CH3Cl)
produced for secondary metabolic reasons are far less likely to have false positives
but because of their highly specialized origin are more likely to be produced in
small quantities. The biomass model estimates are valid to one or two orders of
magnitude; the goal is an independent approach to testing whether a biosignature
gas is plausible rather than a precise quantification of atmospheric biosignature
gases and their corresponding biomasses.},

since they can act both as a source of chlorine radicals, which go on to catalyse
ozone loss, and as powerful greenhouse gases. The long-term impact of these species

from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS)
we present calculations of the stratospheric lifetimes of CFC-12, CCl4, CH4, CH3Cl
and N2O. The lifetimes were calculated using the slope of the tracer-tracer correlation
of these species with CFC-11 at the tropopause. The correlation slopes were corrected
for the changing atmospheric concentrations of each species based on age of air and
CFC-11 measurements from samples taken aboard the Geophysica aircraft - along with
the effective linear trend of the volume mixing ratio (VMR) from tropical ground
based AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) sites. Stratospheric
lifetimes were calculated using a CFC-11 lifetime of 45 yr. These calculations
produced values of 113 + (-) 26 (18) yr (CFC-12), 35 + (-) 11 (7) yr (CCl4), 69 + (-) 65 (23)
yr (CH3Cl), 123 + (-) 53 (28) yr (N2O) and 195 + (-) 75 (42) yr (CH4). The errors
on these values are the weighted 1 sigma non-systematic errors. Systematic errors
were estimated by recalculating lifetimes using VMRs which had been modified to
reflect differences between ACE-FTS retrieved VMRs and those from other instruments.
The results of these calculations, including systematic errors, were as follows: 113 + (-) 32 (20)
for CFC-12, 123 + (-) 83 (35) for N2O, 195 + (-) 139 (57) for CH4, 35 + (-) 14 (8)
for CCl4 and 69 + (-) 2119 (34) yr for CH3Cl. For CH3Cl \& CH4 this represents the
first calculation of the stratospheric lifetime using data from a space based instrument.},

Abstract = {The effectiveness of the recently developed, explicitly correlated

atomization energies derived from complete basis set extrapolations of standard CCSD(T).
Most of the standard method findings were obtained with aug-cc-pV7Z or aug-cc-pV8Z
basis sets. For a few homonuclear diatomic molecules it was possible to push the
basis set to the aug-cc-pV9Z level. F12b calculations were performed with the cc-pVnZ-F12
(n = D, T, Q) basis set sequence and were also extrapolated to the basis set limit
using a Schwenke-style, parameterized formula. A systematic bias was observed in
the F12b method with the (VTZ-F12/VQZ-F12) basis set combination. This bias resulted
in the underestimation of reference values associated with small molecules
(valence correlation energies <0.5 E-h) and an even larger overestimation of
atomization energies for bigger systems. Consequently, caution should be exercised
in the use of F12b for high accuracy studies. Root mean square and mean absolute
deviation error metrics for this basis set combination were comparable to complete
basis set values obtained with standard CCSD(T) and the aug-cc-pVDZ through
aug-cc-pVQZ basis set sequence. However, the mean signed deviation was an order
of magnitude larger. Problems partially due to basis set superposition error were
identified with second row compounds which resulted in a weak performance for the
smaller VDZ-F12/VTZ-F12 combination of basis sets. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is by far the largest natural carrier of chlorin
e to the stratosphere. Its importance in stratospheric ozone chemistry is expected to
increase in the coming decades as emission controls alter the relative contributions
from natural and anthropogenic halogen sources. The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on
NASA's Aura satellite provides the first daily global observations of CH3Cl. Here
we quantify the quality of the MLS version?3 CH3Cl data (single-profile precision
of ï¿½100?pptv; accuracy of 30?45%; vertical and horizontal resolution of 4?5?km and
450?600?km, respectively) and demonstrate their utility for scientific studies over
the vertical range from 147 to 4.6?hPa. We exploit the unmatched scope of the 8
year MLS data set to investigate the spatial, seasonal, and interannual variations
in the distribution of CH3Cl in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS).
Like carbon monoxide, CH3Cl is a marker of pollution from biomass burning that can
be lofted to the UTLS very rapidly by deep convection. The climatological seasonal
cycle in CH3Cl reflects variability in regional fire activity and other surface
sources as well as convection, and anomalous CH3Cl enhancements in the tropical
upper troposphere are linked to specific episodes of intense burning. Methyl chloride
is shown to be very useful as a tracer of large-scale dynamical processes, such as
diabatic descent inside the stratospheric winter polar vortices, quasi-isentropic
cross-tropopause transport associated with the summer monsoon circulations, and
effects related to the quasi-biennial oscillation and the tropical ?tape recorder?.},

Abstract = {Methyl chloride is of interest for atmospheric applications, since
this molecule is directly involved in the catalytic destruction of ozone in the
lower stratosphere. In a previous work {[}Bray et al. JQSRT 2011;112:2446], lines
positions and intensities of self-perturbed (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-37
have been studied into details for the 3.4 mu m spectral region. The present work
is focused on measurement and calculation of N-2-broadening coefficients of the
(CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-37 isotopologues. High-resolution Fourier
Transform spectra of CH3Cl-N-2 mixtures at room-temperature have been recorded
between 2800 and 3200 cm(-1) at LADIR (using a classical source) and between 47
and 59 cm(-1) at SOLEIL (using the synchrotron source on the AILES beamline). 612
mid-infrared transitions of the v(1) band and 86 far-infrared transitions of the
pure rotational band have been analyzed using a multispectrum fitting procedure.
Average accuracy on the deduced N-2-broadening coefficients has been estimated
to 5\% and 10\% in the mid- and far-infrared spectral regions, respectively.
The J- and K-rotational dependences of these coefficients have been observed in
the mid-infrared region and then a simulation has been performed using an empirical
model for 0 <= J <= 50, K <= 9. The (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-35-N-2 line widths for 0 <= J <= 50
and K <= 10 of the v(1) band and for 55 <= J <= 67 and K <= 15 of the pure rotational
band have been computed using a semi-classical approach involving exact trajectories
and a real symmetric-top geometry of the active molecule. Finally, a global comparison
with the experimental and theoretical data existing in the literature has been
performed. Similar J- and K-rotational dependences have been appeared while no
clear evidence for any vibrational or isotopic dependences have been pointed out.

fitting a sum rule to the N-2-broadening coefficients modeled previously. Comparisons

continuous-wave spectrometer (J >= 31). In order to check the accuracy of both techniques,
the measurements of identical lines are compared for J=31. The pressure broadening coefficients
are deduced from line fits using mainly a Voigt profile model. The excellent signal-to-noise
ratio of the frequency-multiplication scheme highlights some speed dependence effect
on the line shape. Theoretical values of these coefficients are calculated by a
semi-classical approach with exact trajectories. An intermolecular potential including
atom-atom interactions is used for the first time. It is shown that, contrary to the
previous theoretical predictions, the contributions of short-range forces are important
for all values of the rotational quantum numbers. Additional testing of modifications
required in the semi-classical formalism for a correct application of the cumulant
expansion is also performed. It is stated that the use of the cumulant average on
the rotational states of the perturbing molecule leads, for high J and small K

strong interacting CH3Cl-N-2 system. The excellent agreement between the theoretical

Given the absence of refined ab initio computed potential energy surfaces and the

theoretical values of these broadening coefficients are estimated by a semi-classical

long-range and short-range (atom-atom) interactions of the active molecule rigorously

potential which governs the relative translational motion. It is demonstrated that
for the very light perturbing molecule H-2 the calculated line widths, practically
independent from the rotational quantum number J (for K <= J), are particularly
sensitive to the position and slope of the repulsive wall. Modifications required
in the semi-classical formalism for a correct application of the cumulant expansion

Abstract = {The leading cause of error in standard coupled cluster theory calculations
of thermodynamic properties such as atomization energies and heats of formation
originates with the truncation of the one-particle basis set expansion. Unfortunately,
the use of finite basis sets is currently a computational necessity. Even with basis
sets of quadruple zeta quality, errors can easily exceed 8 kcal/mol in small molecules,
rendering the results of little practical use. Attempts to address this serious
problem have led to a wide variety of proposals for simple complete basis set
extrapolation formulas that exploit the regularity in the correlation consistent
sequence of basis sets. This study explores the effectiveness of six formulas for
reproducing the complete basis set limit. The W4 approach was also examined, although
in lesser detail. Reference atomization energies were obtained from standard
coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) calculations
involving basis sets of 6 zeta. or better quality for a collection of 141 molecules.
In addition, a subset of 51 atomization energies was treated with explicitly correlated
CCSD(T)-F12b calculations and very large basis sets. Of the formulas considered, all
proved reliable at reducing the one-particle expansion error. Even the least effective
formulas cut the error in the raw values by more than half, a feat requiring a much
larger basis set without the aid of extrapolation. The most effective formulas cut
the mean absolute deviation by a further factor of two. Careful examination of the
complete body of statistics failed to reveal a single choice that out performed the
others for all basis set combinations and all classes of molecules. (C) 2011 American

(3-D) chemical transport model, which is constrained by similar surface data.
ACE-FTS measurements of CFCs show declining trends which agree with both AGAGE
and SLIMCAT values. There are problems with the ACE-FTS retrievals of CFC-113
and HCFCs, with work currently ongoing to correct these problems. At lower altitudes
the volume mixing ratio (VMR) of these species increase with altitude. This is
due to problems with the retrievals at high beta angle (the angle between the
orbital plane and the Earth-Sun vector). Although some of the retrievals have
problems, we are confident that the trends are generally reliable. The concentrations
of HCFCs appear to be increasing with ACE-FTS, SLIMCAT and AGAGE all showing
positive trends. ACE-FTS measurements of the decomposition products (COFCl and COCl2)
do not show any significant trends. SLIMCAT data show a negative trend for COFCl
which corresponds to the decrease in CFC-11, its assumed major source, during
this time. COF2 measurements from ACE-FTS show an increasing trend, while SLIMCAT
shows a decreasing trend again linked to its assumed production from CFCs. ClONO2
is highly photosensitive, thus the ACE-FTS occultations have been divided into
local morning and evening occultations. Evening measurements of ClONO2 show a
decreasing trend in VMR, while morning measurements show an increasing trend.
The reason for this difference is not understood at this time. The SLIMCAT output
used in this study was not saved as local sunrise and sunset: therefore, only 24 h
mean fields are available for ClONO2. These SLIMCAT data show a decreasing trend.
SLIMCAT and ACE-FTS both show an increasing trend in the VMR of HF and a decreasing
trend in the VMR of HCl. These results illustrate the success of the Montreal Protocol
in reducing ozone depleting substances. The reduction in anthropogenic chlorine emissions
has led to a decrease in the VMR of stratospheric HCl. The replacement of CFCs with
HCFCs has led to an increase in the VMR of HF in the stratosphere. As chlorine-containing
compounds continue to be phased out and replaced by fluorine-containing molecules, it is
likely that total atmospheric fluorine will continue increasing in the near future.

Pages = {2395-2445},
Abstract = {The updated 2009 edition of the spectroscopic database GEISA (Gestion
et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques Atmospheriques; Management and Study of
Atmospheric Spectroscopic Information) is described in this paper. GEISA is a
computer-accessible system comprising three independent sub-databases devoted, respectively,
to: line parameters, infrared and ultraviolet/visible absorption cross-sections,
microphysical and optical properties of atmospheric aerosols. In this edition, 50
molecules are involved in the line parameters sub-database, including 111 isotopologues,
for a total of 3,807,997 entries, in the spectral range from 10(-6) to 35,877.031 cm(-1).
The successful performances of the new generation of hyperspectral sounders depend
ultimately on the accuracy to which the spectroscopic parameters of the optically
active atmospheric gases are known, since they constitute an essential input to the
forward radiative transfer models that are used to interpret their observations.
Currently, GEISA is involved in activities related to the assessment of the capabilities
of IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer; http://smsc.cnes.fr/lASI/index.htm)
on board the METOP European satellite through the GEISA/IASI database derived from GEISA.
Since the Metop-A (http://www.eumetsat.int) launch (19 October 2006), GEISA is the
reference spectroscopic database for the validation of the level-1 IASI data. Also,
GEISA is involved in planetary research, i.e., modeling of Titan's atmosphere, in
the comparison with observations performed by Voyager, or by ground-based telescopes,
and by the instruments on board the Cassini-Huygens mission. GEISA, continuously
developed and maintained at LMD (Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique, France)
since 1976, is implemented on the IPSL/CNRS (France) ``Ether{''} Products and
Services Centre WEB site (http://ether.ipsl.jussieu.fr), where all archived spectroscopic
data can be handled through general and user friendly associated management software
facilities. More than 350 researchers are registered for on line use of GEISA.

Abstract = {The case of symmetric tops CH3X (X = Br, Cl, F, ... ) perturbed by non-polar
diatoms Y-2 (Y = N-2, O-2, ... ) is analysed from the viewpoint of theoretical
collisional broadening of their rotational lines observed in atmospheric spectra.
A semi-classical approach involving an exponential representation of the scattering
operator and exact trajectories governed by the isotropic potential is presented.
For the first time the active molecule is strictly treated as a symmetric top and
the atom-atom interactions are included in the intermolecular potential model.
It is shown for the CH3Cl-O-2 system that these interactions contribute significantly
to the line width for all values of the rotational quantum numbers J and K.
Additional testing of modifications required in the semi-classical formalism for a
correct application of the cumulant expansion is performed and it is shown that
the use of the cumulant average on the rotational states of the perturbing molecule
leads to entirely negligible effects for the not very strongly interacting CH3Cl-O-2
system. In order to check the theoretical predictions and to extend the scarce
experimental data available in the literature to higher values of the rotational
quantum numbers, new measurements of room-temperature O-2-broadened CH3Cl rotational
lines are carried out by a photomixing continuous-wave terahertz spectrometer.
The experimental line widths extracted with a Voigt profile model demonstrate an
excellent agreement with theoretical results up to very high J-values (J = 31, 37, 40, 45, 50).},

errors arising from core/valence and relativistic corrections are also probed for
a number of small chemical systems. The accuracies of several formulas for estimating
total energies and atomization energies in the complete basis set limit are compared
in light of the present large basis set findings. In agreement with previous work,
the CCSD(T) method is found to provide results that are closer to the CCSDTQ and

degrees S, and 60 degrees - 82 degrees S), averaging the period of February 2004
to January 2005 inclusive, when possible, to deal with seasonal variations. The
effect of diurnal variation was avoided by only using measurements taken at local
sunset. Mean stratospheric Cl-TOT values of 3.65 ppbv were determined for both the
northern and southern midlatitudes (with an estimated 1 sigma accuracy of +/- 0.13 ppbv
and a precision of +/- 0.09 ppbv), accompanied by a slightly lower value in the
tropics and slightly higher values at high latitudes. Stratospheric Cl-TOT profiles
in all five latitude zones are nearly linear with a slight positive slope in ppbv/km.
Both the observed slopes and pattern of latitudinal variation can be interpreted
as evidence of the beginning of a decline in global stratospheric chlorine, which
is qualitatively consistent with the mean stratospheric circulation pattern and
time lag necessary for transport.},

Abstract = {Coupled one-dimensional photochemical-climate calculations have been

and thermal-infrared synthetic spectra of these planets were generated to determine
which biosignature gases might be observed by a future, space-based telescope. Our
star sample included two observed active M dwarfs-AD Leo and GJ 643-and three
quiescent model stars. The spectral distribution of these stars in the ultraviolet
generates a different photochemistry on these planets. As a result, the biogenic
gases CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl have substantially longer lifetimes and higher mixing
ratios than on Earth, making them potentially observable by space-based telescopes.
On the active M-star planets, an ozone layer similar to Earth's was developed that
resulted in a spectroscopic signature comparable to the terrestrial one. The
simultaneous detection of O-2 (or O-3) and a reduced gas in a planet's atmosphere
has been suggested as strong evidence for life. Planets circling M stars may be
good locations to search for such evidence.},

intrashell (core-core) correlation energy. Since the effect of including the core
electrons on the calculation of molecular properties tends to be dominated by
core-valence correlation effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting
functions was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions to
be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just the core-valence
(intershell) correlation energy, except that a small amount of core-core correlation
energy was included in order to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis
set limit. These new sets, denoted weighted core-valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ),
significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties with n. Optimum
cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also developed and show similar advantages.
Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)]
calculations on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al-2, Si-2,
P-2, S-2, and Cl-2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving first row
atoms (CO, SiO, PN, and BCl). For the calculation of core correlation effects on
energetic and spectroscopic properties, the cc-pwCVnZ basis sets are recommended
over the cc-pCVnZ ones. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {For molecules containing second row atoms, unacceptable errors have
been found in extrapolating dissociation energies calculated with the standard
correlation consistent basis sets to the complete basis set limit. By carefully
comparing the convergence behavior of D-e(O-2) and D-e(SO), we show that the cause
of these errors is a result of two inter-related problems: near duplication of the
exponents in two of the d sets and a lack of high-exponent functions in the early
members of the sets. Similar problems exist for the f sets (and probably in higher
angular momentum sets), but have only a minor effect on the calculated dissociation
energies. A number of approaches to address the problems in the d sets were investigated.
Well behaved convergence was obtained by augmenting the (1d) and (2d) sets with a
high-exponent function and by replacing the (3d) set by the (4d) set and the (4d)
set by the (5d) set and so on. To ensure satisfactory coverage of both the L and
M shell regions, the exponents of the new d sets were re-optimized. Benchmark
calculations on Si-2, PN, SO, and AlCl with the new cc-pV(n+d)Z sets show greatly
improved convergence behavior not only for D-e but for many other properties as
well. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

the C-H(D) bending vibrations. This joint approach, which also takes account of
Fermi resonances, enabled the determination of stretch/bend anharmonicity and
Fermi-resonance parameter sets which reproduce the observed data over wide energy
ranges and compare much more favorably with literature ab initio results than
previous parameter sets. The analyses have lead to a new vibrational assignment

are force constants for out-of-plane bending in the ct-bonded molecules and for

functions on all atoms such as 6-311+g{*}{*} and 6-311+g(2d,2p). The force fields
computed with MP2 theory are as accurate as those computed at the MP4 level except
that HX stretching force constants are consistently overestimated by ca. 3\% with MP2

use with self-consistent-field molecular orbitals and is invariant to the same
orbital rotations as the coupled-cluster energy. T1 is investigated for several
different chemical systems which exhibit a range of multireference behavior and
is shown to be an excellent measure of the importance of nondynamical electron
correlation and is far superior to C0 from a singles and doubles configuration
interaction wave function. It is further suggested that when the aim is to recover
a large fraction of the dynamical electron correlation energy, a large T1 (i.e., >0.02)
probably indicates the need for a multireference electron correlation procedure.},

obtained at the SCF approximation level from a set of gaussian valence orbitals
contracted in double-zeta form and enriched with polarization functions compare
well with experimental assignments of force and interaction constants, as well as
integrated intensities from infrared data. The transferability of atomic force
fields and polar tensors (second derivatives of total energies and first derivatives
of dipole moments with respect to atomic displacements in cartesian coordinates)
