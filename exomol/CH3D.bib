Abstract = {Monodeuterated methane (CH3D) contributes greatly to absorption in the
   1.58 mu m methane transparency window. The spectrum is dominated by the
   3 nu(2) band near 6430 cm(-1), which is observed in natural methane and
   used for a number of planetary applications, such as the determination
   of the D/H ratio. In this work, we analyze the CH3D spectrum recorded by
   high-sensitivity differential absorption spectroscopy in the 6099-6530
   cm(-1) region, both at room temperature and at 81 K. Following a first
   contribution to this topic by Lu et al., the room-temperature line list
   is elaborated (11,189 lines) and combined with the previous 81 K list
   (8962 lines) in order to derive about 4800 empirical lower-state energy
   values from the ratio of the line intensities measured at 81 K and 294 K
   (2T-method). Relying on the position and intensity agreements with the
   TheoReTS variational line list, about 2890 transitions are
   rovibrationally assigned to twenty bands, with fifteen of them being
   newly reported. Variational positions deviate from measurements by up to
   2 cm(-1), and the band intensities are found to be in good agreement
   with measurements. All the reported assignments are confirmed by
   Ground-State Combination Difference (GSCD) relations; i.e., all the
   upper-state energies (about 1370 in total) have coinciding
   determinations through several transitions (up to 8). The energy values,
   determined with a typical uncertainty of 10(-3) cm(-1), are compared to
   their empirical and variational counterparts. The intensity sum of the
   transitions assigned between 6190 and 6530 cm(-1) represents 76.9 and
   90.0\% of the total experimental intensities at 294 K and 81 K,
   respectively.},

Title = {Preliminary analysis of CH3D from 3250 to 3700 cm(-1)},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {240},
Pages = {14-25},
Abstract = {The infrared spectrum of CH3D from 3250 to 3700 cm(-1) was studied for
   the first time to assign transitions involving the nu(2) + nu(3), nu(2)
   + nu(5), nu(2) + nu(6), nu(3) + 2(nu 6) and 3 nu(6) vibrational states.
   Line positions and intensities were measured at 0.011 cm(-1) resolution
   using Fourier transform spectra recorded at Kitt Peak with isotopically
   enriched samples. Some 2852 line positions (involving over 900 upper
   state levels) and 874 line intensities were reproduced with RMS values
   of 0.0009 cm(-1) and 4.6\%, respectively. The strongest bands were found
   to be nu(2) + nu(3) at 3499.7 cm(-1) and nu(2) + nu(6) at 3342.5 cm(-1)
   with integrated strengths, respectively, of 8.17 x 10(-20) and 2.44 x
   10(-20) (cm(-1)/ molecule center dot cm(-2)) at 296 K (for 100\% CH3D).
   The effective Hamiltonian was expressed in terms of irreducible tensor
   operators and adapted to symmetric top molecules. Its present
   configuration in the MIRS package permitted simultaneous consideration
   of the four lowest polyads of CH3D: the Ground State (G.S.), the Triad
   from 6.3 to 9.5 mu m, the Nonad from 3.1 to 4.8 mu m and now the
   Enneadecad (19 bands) from 2.2 to 3.1 mu m. The CH3D line parameters for
   this interval were calculated to create a new database for the 3 mu m
   region. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
