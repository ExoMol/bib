Abstract = {Six Fourier transform spectra recorded at room temperature and for
   pressures ranging from 0.1 to 4 mbar were analyzed in the spectral
   region of the v3 band of CH3F around 9.5 mu m. A multispectrum fitting
   procedure was used to measure the line positions and intensities for
   three bands (v3, v3+v6-v6, 2v3-v3) of 12CH3F and one band (v3) of 13CH3F
   using the Voigt profile. The measured line intensities were then modeled
   using the vibrational transition dipole moment squared and a weak
   Herman-Wallis coefficient. A theoretical calculation of line positions
   based on ab initio and effective Hamiltonian models was performed and
   then compared to present measurements and calculations from the
   literature. The current work finally present a complete list (in HITRAN
   format) of the line parameters for four bands of CH3F (8907 transitions)
   in the 9.5 mu m spectral region.},

  abstract  ={Accurate ab initio calculations on the rotation�vibration spectrum of methyl fluoride (CH3F) are reported. A new nine-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment surface (DMS) have been generated using high-level electronic structure methods. Notably{,} the PES was constructed from explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and considered additional energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation{,} higher-order coupled cluster terms beyond perturbative triples{,} scalar relativistic effects{,} and the diagonal Born�Oppenheimer correction. The PES and DMS are evaluated through robust variational nuclear motion computations of pure rotational and vibrational energy levels{,} the equilibrium geometry of CH3F{,} vibrational transition moments{,} absolute line intensities of the v6 band{,} and the rotation�vibration spectrum up to J = 40. The computed results show excellent agreement with a range of experimental sources{,} in particular the six fundamentals are reproduced with a root-mean-square error of 0.69 cm-1. This work represents the most accurate theoretical treatment of the rovibrational spectrum of CH3F}

  abstract = {A new potential energy surface of methyl fluoride is constructed using
	extended ab initio CCSD(T) calculations with the cc-pVQZ basis at
	5100 nuclear configurations. Its analytical representation is determined
	through an expansion in symmetry adapted products of orthogonal coordinates
	involving 600 parameters up to 6th order. A good convergence for
	variational calculations of vibrational levels of the CH3F molecule
	was obtained with a RMS(obs.-calc.) deviation of less than 4 cm(-1)
	for fundamental band centers. The equilibrium geometry of the ab
	initio PES was empirically optimized using experimental J = 1 energy
	levels for four isotopologues (CH3F)-C-12, (CH3F)-C-13, (CD3F)-C-12,
	and (CD3F)-C-13. The resulting variational calculations with the
	full normal mode Hamiltonian in the irreducible tensor representation
	gave a RMS(obs.-calc) deviation of 0.00036 cm(-1) for rotational
	energies up to J = 5 for the major isotopologue. This represents
	a considerable improvement with respect to available global predictions
	of vibration and rotational levels of methyl fluoride.},
