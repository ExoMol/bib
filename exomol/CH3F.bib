  abstract  ={Accurate ab initio calculations on the rotation�vibration spectrum of methyl fluoride (CH3F) are reported. A new nine-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment surface (DMS) have been generated using high-level electronic structure methods. Notably{,} the PES was constructed from explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and considered additional energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation{,} higher-order coupled cluster terms beyond perturbative triples{,} scalar relativistic effects{,} and the diagonal Born�Oppenheimer correction. The PES and DMS are evaluated through robust variational nuclear motion computations of pure rotational and vibrational energy levels{,} the equilibrium geometry of CH3F{,} vibrational transition moments{,} absolute line intensities of the v6 band{,} and the rotation�vibration spectrum up to J = 40. The computed results show excellent agreement with a range of experimental sources{,} in particular the six fundamentals are reproduced with a root-mean-square error of 0.69 cm-1. This work represents the most accurate theoretical treatment of the rovibrational spectrum of CH3F}

  abstract = {A new potential energy surface of methyl fluoride is constructed using
	extended ab initio CCSD(T) calculations with the cc-pVQZ basis at
	5100 nuclear configurations. Its analytical representation is determined
	through an expansion in symmetry adapted products of orthogonal coordinates
	involving 600 parameters up to 6th order. A good convergence for
	variational calculations of vibrational levels of the CH3F molecule
	was obtained with a RMS(obs.-calc.) deviation of less than 4 cm(-1)
	for fundamental band centers. The equilibrium geometry of the ab
	initio PES was empirically optimized using experimental J = 1 energy
	levels for four isotopologues (CH3F)-C-12, (CH3F)-C-13, (CD3F)-C-12,
	and (CD3F)-C-13. The resulting variational calculations with the
	full normal mode Hamiltonian in the irreducible tensor representation
	gave a RMS(obs.-calc) deviation of 0.00036 cm(-1) for rotational
	energies up to J = 5 for the major isotopologue. This represents
	a considerable improvement with respect to available global predictions
	of vibration and rotational levels of methyl fluoride. (c) 2012 Elsevier
