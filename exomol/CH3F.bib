abstract = {Infrared spectra of CH3F were recorded in the 2200 cm−1 region using a Fourier transform spectrometer in Reims, France, with a resolution of 0.003 cm−1. The measurements were conducted using spectra recorded using a White-type cell (set to an absorption path length equal to 8.26 m) and different pressures of CH3F (1–15 mbar). This spectral region corresponds to the ν3+ν6 band, which is measured for the first time in this work. Experimental line positions and intensities were determined using the Voigt lineshape together with a single-spectrum fitting procedure. The band assignment was carried out up to J=45 and K=15 using our home-made SpectraMatcher computer code, resulting in more than 1800 measured lines. Strong intensity perturbations were observed, explained by a strong Coriolis coupling between the upper states of the 2ν3 and ν3+ν6 bands. The squared dipole moment was determined for each transition, resulting in the determination of the vibrational transition moment and the Herman–Wallis coefficients of the ν3+ν6 band using the Watson’s model.}

   9.5 μm},

Abstract = {Six Fourier transform spectra recorded at room temperature and for
   pressures ranging from 0.1 to 4 mbar were analyzed in the spectral
   region of the v3 band of CH3F around 9.5 mu m. A multispectrum fitting
   procedure was used to measure the line positions and intensities for
   three bands (v3, v3+v6-v6, 2v3-v3) of 12CH3F and one band (v3) of 13CH3F
   using the Voigt profile. The measured line intensities were then modeled
   using the vibrational transition dipole moment squared and a weak
   Herman-Wallis coefficient. A theoretical calculation of line positions
   based on ab initio and effective Hamiltonian models was performed and
   then compared to present measurements and calculations from the
   literature. The current work finally present a complete list (in HITRAN
   format) of the line parameters for four bands of CH3F (8907 transitions)
   in the 9.5 mu m spectral region.},

  abstract  ={Accurate ab initio calculations on the rotation�vibration spectrum of methyl fluoride (CH3F) are reported. A new nine-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment surface (DMS) have been generated using high-level electronic structure methods. Notably{,} the PES was constructed from explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and considered additional energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation{,} higher-order coupled cluster terms beyond perturbative triples{,} scalar relativistic effects{,} and the diagonal Born�Oppenheimer correction. The PES and DMS are evaluated through robust variational nuclear motion computations of pure rotational and vibrational energy levels{,} the equilibrium geometry of CH3F{,} vibrational transition moments{,} absolute line intensities of the v6 band{,} and the rotation�vibration spectrum up to J = 40. The computed results show excellent agreement with a range of experimental sources{,} in particular the six fundamentals are reproduced with a root-mean-square error of 0.69 cm-1. This work represents the most accurate theoretical treatment of the rovibrational spectrum of CH3F}
