  abstract = {A new potential energy surface of methyl fluoride is constructed using
	extended ab initio CCSD(T) calculations with the cc-pVQZ basis at
	5100 nuclear configurations. Its analytical representation is determined
	through an expansion in symmetry adapted products of orthogonal coordinates
	involving 600 parameters up to 6th order. A good convergence for
	variational calculations of vibrational levels of the CH3F molecule
	was obtained with a RMS(obs.-calc.) deviation of less than 4 cm(-1)
	for fundamental band centers. The equilibrium geometry of the ab
	initio PES was empirically optimized using experimental J = 1 energy
	levels for four isotopologues (CH3F)-C-12, (CH3F)-C-13, (CD3F)-C-12,
	and (CD3F)-C-13. The resulting variational calculations with the
	full normal mode Hamiltonian in the irreducible tensor representation
	gave a RMS(obs.-calc) deviation of 0.00036 cm(-1) for rotational
	energies up to J = 5 for the major isotopologue. This represents
	a considerable improvement with respect to available global predictions
	of vibration and rotational levels of methyl fluoride. (c) 2012 Elsevier
