Title = {How Vibrational Notations Can Spoil Infrared Spectroscopy: A Case Study
   on Isolated Methanol},
Journal = {ACS PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AU},
Year = {2024},
Abstract = {Unraveling methanol's infrared spectrum has challenged spectroscopists
   for a century, with numerous loose ends still to be explored. We engage
   in this exploration based on experiments of isolating single methanol
   molecules in solid argon and neon matrices. We report infrared spectra
   of methanol in its natural isotopic composition and with partial and
   full deuteration. These experiments are accompanied by calculating
   wavenumbers involving anharmonicity and mode-coupling based on the
   vibrational configuration interaction approach. This allows for an
   unambiguous assignment of all fundamentals and resonances in the
   mid-infrared spectrum. An increasing degree of deuteration lifts
   resonances and aids in assigning bands uniquely. It also becomes evident
   that different notations typically used in chemistry or physics to
   describe molecular vibration from spectroscopy fail to describe the
   spectra appropriately. We highlight the shortcomings and suggest a more
   elaborate analysis using Sankey diagrams to unambiguously identify
   spectral features. Consequently, we demystify debated resonances
   occurring from various stretches and deformations of the methyl group.},

    abstract = "{We report the upgrade and operation of a frequency-comb-assisted high-resolution mid-infrared molecular spectrometer, allowing us to combine high spectral purity, International System of Units (SI)-traceability, wide tunability, and high sensitivity. An optical frequency comb is used to transfer the spectral purity of a SI-traceable 1.54 μm metrology-grade frequency reference to a 10.3 μm quantum cascade laser (QCL). The near-infrared reference is operated at the French time/frequency metrology institute, calibrated there to primary frequency standards, and transferred to Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers via the REFIMEVE fiber network. The QCL exhibits a linewidth of δν ∼ 0.1 Hz and a sub-10−15 relative frequency stability from 0.1 to 10 s, and its frequency is traceable to the SI with a total relative uncertainty better than 4 × 10−14 after 1 s averaging time. We have developed the instrumentation allowing comb modes to be continuously tuned over 9 GHz, resulting in a QCL of record spectral purity uninterruptedly tunable at the precision of the reference over an unprecedented span of Δν = 1.4 GHz. We have used our apparatus to conduct sub-Doppler spectroscopy of methanol in a multi-pass cell, demonstrating state-of-the-art frequency uncertainties down to the few kilohertz level (∼10−10 in relative value). We have observed weak intensity resonances unreported so far, resolved subtle doublets never seen before, and brought to light discrepancies with HITRAN. This demonstrates the potential of our apparatus for probing subtle internal molecular processes, building accurate spectroscopic models of polyatomic molecules of atmospheric or astrophysical interest, and carrying out precise spectroscopic tests of fundamental physics.}",

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {128-139},
Abstract = {{Given the expectations associated with modern observational facilities
   such as Herschel, ALMA and SOFIA, and the ubiquity of methanol in
   interstellar gas, precise knowledge of the methanol spectrum is
   critical. Abundant research has characterized the line positions and
   quantum assignments in the far infrared, but there is a dearth of line
   intensity information at most wavelengths. In this work, an empirical
   database of methanol line intensities from 300 to 500 cm(-1) has been
   compiled from far-infrared measurements recorded on the Bruker IFS 125
   HR Fourier transform spectrometer located at the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory. The sum of the integrated line intensities has been computed
   (Sigma(Int) = 1.13 x 10(-18) cm(-1)/(molecule cm(-2))) at 296 K for 1317
   measured features. These have been combined with known assignments for
   2v(12)-gs, v(12)-gs, 2v(12)-v(12) plus a few other bands with a small
   number of transitions in the spectral range of this study. Line
   intensities of 916 unblended features have been compared to available
   theoretical calculations of Mekhtiev et al., J. Mol. Spectrosc., 194,
   171-178 (1999). These results support the analysis of astronomical
   observations taken from orbit by the Herschel HIFI instrument. (C) 2011

Title = {{Torsion-rotation global analysis of the first three torsional states
   (nu(t)=0, 1, 2) and terahertz database for methanol}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{251}},
Pages = {305-313},
Abstract = {{Stimulated by recent THz measurements of the methanol spectrum in one of
   our laboratories, undertaken in support of NASA programs related to the
   Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
   (ALMA), we have carried Out a global analysis of available microwave and
   high-resolution infrared data for the first three torsional states
   (nu(t) = 0, 1, 2), and for J values up to 30. This global fit of
   approximately 5600 frequency measurements and 19000 Fourier transform
   far infrared (FTFIR) wavenumber measurements to 119 parameters reaches
   the estimated experimental measurement accuracy for the FTFIR
   transitions, and about twice the estimated experimental measurement
   accuracy for the microwave, submillimeter-wave, and terahertz
   transitions. The present fit is essentially a continuation Of Our
   earlier work, but we have greatly expanded our previous data set and
   have added a large number of new torsion-rotation interaction terms to
   the Hamiltonian in Our previously used Computer program. The results,
   together with a number of calculated (but unmeasured) transitions,
   including their line strength, estimated uncertainty, and lower state
   energy, are made available in the supplementary material as a database
   formatted to be useful for astronomical searches. Some discussion of
   several open spectroscopic problems, e.g., (i) an improved notation for
   the numerous parameters in the torsion-rotation Hamiltonian, (ii)
   possible causes of the failure to fit frequency measurements to the
   estimated measurement uncertainty, and (iii) pitfalls to be avoided when
   intercomparing apparently identical parameters from the internal axis
   method and the rho axis method are also given.}},
