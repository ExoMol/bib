abstract = {The infrared Fourier transform spectrum of the lower
    vibrational modes of the CD3SH isotopologue of methyl mercaptan
    has been recorded using synchrotron radiation at the FIR beamline
    of the Canadian Light Source. Torsion-rotation structure has been
    analyzed for a strong parallel band centred at 644 cm−1 and a 
    weaker perpendicular band centred at 727 cm−1, identified respectively 
    with a mixed {in-plane-CD3-rocking/CSH-bending} mode and the out-of-plane 
    CD3 rock. The torsional energies for the latter mode follow well-behaved curves, 
    inverted with respect to the ground state, but those for the former 
    do not display a systematic pattern. Surprisingly, no clear evidence was 
    seen for the C-S stretching fundamental band, in contrast to CH3SH and the 
    analogous CD3OH and CH3OH methanol species for which the corresponding C-S or 
    C-O stretching bands are major features of the spectrum. This mystery prompted an 
    ab initio calculation to compare the CD3SH and CH3SH vibrational frequencies 
    and transition moments. A mode lying in the expected position was indeed 
    predicted for CD3SH but with almost vanishing intensity. The calculated 
    reduced mass and effective force constant for this mode corresponded closely 
    to those for the C-S stretch of normal CH3SH, indicating that an anticipated 
    strong C-S stretching band is in fact almost completely extinguished for CD3SH.}
