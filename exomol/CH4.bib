title = {Measurement of Methane Line Broadening in Hot Hydrogen/Helium Atmospheres at $\lambda = 1.60-1.63 $\mu$m for Substellar Object Spectroscopy},
journal = ApJ,
abstract = {Recent high-dispersion spectroscopy from ground-based telescopes and high-precision spectroscopy from space observatories have enabled atmospheric observations of substellar objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot gaseous exoplanets, with sufficient precision to make ambient gas differences in molecular line broadening a significant factor. In this paper, we experimentally measured the pressure broadening of methane in a high-temperature hydrogen–helium background atmosphere in the H band, which had not been previously measured. The experiment used glass cells, inserted in a tube furnace, filled with methane in a hydrogen–helium background atmosphere or pure methane gas. Spectra were obtained at four temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1000 K, in the wavelength range 1.60–1.63 μm, using a tunable laser, yielding eight high-resolution spectra in total. A full Bayesian analysis was performed on the obtained spectra, using the differentiable spectral model ExoJAX and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inferring a large number of parameters, allowing us to infer the H2/He pressure broadening for 22 transitions mainly in the R branch of the 2ν3 band. As a result, we found a temperature exponent of approximately 0.27 and a reference width at 296 K of around 0.040 for Jlower = 13–20. This temperature dependency is much milder than that provided by the molecular database ExoMol, yielding a line width approximately 5%–45% smaller than ExoMol at 296 K, but similar at 1000 K. Our results suggest the need for further accumulation of experimental data for spectral analysis of substellar objects with hydrogen–helium atmospheres.}

Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {628},
Pages = {511+},
Abstract = {Beyond our Solar System, aurorae have been inferred from radio
   observations of isolated brown dwarfs(1,2). Within our Solar System,
   giant planets have auroral emission with signatures across the
   electromagnetic spectrum including infrared emission of H-3(+) and
   methane. Isolated brown dwarfs with auroral signatures in the radio have
   been searched for corresponding infrared features, but only null
   detections have been reported(3). CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3. (W1935 for
   short) is an isolated brown dwarf with a temperature of approximately
   482K. Here we report James Webb Space Telescope observations of strong
   methane emission from W1935 at 3.326 mu m. Atmospheric modelling leads
   us to conclude that a temperature inversion of approximately 300K
   centred at 1-10mbar replicates the feature. This represents an
   atmospheric temperature inversion for a Jupiter-like atmosphere without
   irradiation from a host star. A plausible explanation for the strong
   inversion is heating by auroral processes, although other internal and
   external dynamical processes cannot be ruled out. The best-fitting model
   rules out the contribution of H-3(+) emission, which is prominent in
   Solar System gas giants. However, this is consistent with rapid
   destruction of H-3(+) at the higher pressure where the W1935 emission
   originates(4).},

Abstract = {The conversion of methane (CH4) into the hydrocarbons ethane (C2H6) and

Abstract = {Potential energy surfaces (PES) of methane which are constructed using
   ten symmetrised combinations of four bond length and six interbond

   is increased without notable deterioration at low-E levels (rms
   deviation of 0.26 cm- 1). Based on a comparison between various variants
   of (10S) PESs we expect that new theoretical band origins should have

TITLE = {{The CH$_3$D Absorption Spectrum Near 1.58 $\mu$m: Extended Line Lists and Rovibrational Assignments}},
JOURNAL = {Molecules},
VOLUME = {29},
YEAR = {2024},
pages = {5276},
ABSTRACT = {Monodeuterated methane (CH3D) contributes greatly to absorption in the 1.58 μm methane transparency window. The spectrum is dominated by the 3ν2 band near 6430 cm−1, which is observed in natural methane and used for a number of planetary applications, such as the determination of the D/H ratio. In this work, we analyze the CH3D spectrum recorded by high-sensitivity differential absorption spectroscopy in the 6099–6530 cm−1 region, both at room temperature and at 81 K. Following a first contribution to this topic by Lu et al., the room-temperature line list is elaborated (11,189 lines) and combined with the previous 81 K list (8962 lines) in order to derive about 4800 empirical lower-state energy values from the ratio of the line intensities measured at 81 K and 294 K (2T-method). Relying on the position and intensity agreements with the TheoReTS variational line list, about 2890 transitions are rovibrationally assigned to twenty bands, with fifteen of them being newly reported. Variational positions deviate from measurements by up to 2 cm−1, and the band intensities are found to be in good agreement with measurements. All the reported assignments are confirmed by Ground-State Combination Difference (GSCD) relations; i.e., all the upper-state energies (about 1370 in total) have coinciding determinations through several transitions (up to 8). The energy values, determined with a typical uncertainty of 10−3 cm−1, are compared to their empirical and variational counterparts. The intensity sum of the transitions assigned between 6190 and 6530 cm−1 represents 76.9 and 90.0% of the total experimental intensities at 294 K and 81 K, respectively.},

Volume = {128},
Abstract = {Methane is thought to have been an important greenhouse gas during the
   Archean, although its potential warming has been found to be limited at
   high concentrations due to its high shortwave absorption. We use the Met
   Office Unified Model, a general circulation model, to further explore
   the climatic effect of different Archean methane concentrations. Surface
   warming peaks at a pressure ratio pCH(4):pCO(2) of approximately 0.1,
   reaching a maximum of up to 7 K before significant cooling above this
   ratio. Equator-to-pole temperature differences also tend to increase up
   to pCH(4) <= 300 Pa, which is driven by a difference in radiative
   forcing at the equator and poles by methane and a reduction in the
   latitudinal extend of the Hadley circulation. 3D models are important to
   fully capture the cooling effect of methane, due to these impacts of the
   circulation.},

Abstract = {Broadband precision spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for high-fidelity
   species diagnostics as well as multispecies sensing in complex

   coverage and high spectral resolution present great challenges to both
   optical measurement systems and data acquisition and processing. We
   report methodological and experimental demonstration of a mid -infrared

   algorithm. Efficient data sampling and accurate spectral recovery are
   demonstrated with comb-teeth-resolving resolution of 0.0083 cm-1 (250
   MHz) over a spectral range of 300 cm-1. The v3 band of CH4 is measured,

Year = {2022},
Volume = {49},
Abstract = {Methane (CH4) has significant absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.7,
   2.3, 3.3 and 7.6 mu m which absorb incoming solar `shortwave' (SW)
   radiation and contribute to radiative forcing (RF). A comprehensive
   quantification of CH4 SW RF is presented using a narrow-band radiative
   transfer model to calculate spatially and monthly resolved estimates of
   CH4 SW RF and its impact on longwave (LW) stratospheric temperature
   adjusted RF (SARF). These new calculations include satellite
   measurements of CH4 distribution and spectrally varying surface albedo,
   and include absorption of solar mid-infrared radiation by methane's 7.6
   mu m band. These factors substantially influence methane's SW effect.
   For a 750-1,800 ppb perturbation, the all-sky top-of-atmosphere SW
   instantaneous RF is 0.082 W m(-2); at the tropopause it is 0.002 W
   m(-2), considerably smaller than previous estimates. Including the
   impact of SW absorption on stratospheric temperature increases
   tropopause SARF by 0.039 W m(-2) (or 7\%) compared to the LW-only SARF.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {254},
pages = {107187},
Abstract = {The information in spectroscopic databases is routinely updated,
   therefore it is necessary to evaluate on a regular basis how efficient
   the improvements in spectroscopic data are with respect to the
   atmospheric remote sensing problems. One of such problems is the methane
   total column retrieval from the ground-based FTIR measurements of the
   direct solar radiation. The CH4 line parameters contained in various
   modern spectroscopic databases demonstrate some differences. In the
   present study, the impact of these differences on the atmospheric
   methane retrievals is estimated. The ground-based FTIR measurements at
   the St.Petersburg and Kourovka observational stations (Russian
   Federation) are taken as the basis for the study. The retrieval
   algorithms conform to the specifications worked out by the IRWG NDACC
   and TCCON networks. The databases HITRAN2001, HITRAN2008, HITRAN2012,
   HITRAN2016, GEISA, ATM12, ATM16, ATM19 and the GOSAT2014 line list are
   used as the input for the forward modeling and for the retrievals of the
   CH4 total column. Different criteria for quality assessment of fitting
   of measured and simulated transmittance spectra are considered. It has
   been shown that the variability of the methane total column values
   retrieved using absorption line parameters from different spectroscopic
   databases reaches 1.7\%. The obtained results confirmed that for
   mid-infrared range the current IRWG NDACC recommendation to use
   HITRAN2001 is still valid: the HITRAN2001 data provide better CH 4
   retrievals than the newer spectroscopic databases, with the exception of
   one database (ATM19) yielding slightly different results but comparable
   to HITRAN2001. The best retrieval results in the near-infrared region
   are observed when the ATM, HITRAN2008 and GEISA2011 databases are used.
   The lowest value of RMS corresponded to the calculations which used the

Abstract = {Reduced matrix elements (RMEs) for collisionally induced transitions are
   an important component of semi-classical line shape calculations. They
   give the quantum mechanical probability for a transition in the
   radiating molecule occurring due to a collision with one of the bath
   molecules. The RMEs for both the radiating and perturbing molecules are
   part of the quantum mechanical component of a semi-classical
   calculation. Evaluating the reduced matrix elements requires
   wavefunctions for the molecules in question. In this work, RMEs for
   ro-vibrational states of methane are evaluated using ab initio
   wavefunctions. These RMEs are compared with RMEs evaluated using a
   Hamiltonian model to the fourth order in the T-d formalism. Comparisons
   are made for the ground and v(3) states, where the v(3) state is treated
   as an isolated state by an Effective Hamiltonian. The formulas for the
   reduced matrix elements are developed in both formalisms. The comparison
   shows good agreement for low angular momentum states, where the isolated
   state approximation should be valid. Using sum rules as a check of the
   RMEs revealed that all symmetry components of the wavefunctions are
   needed in a line shape calculation. Line shape parameters are evaluated
   using the ab initio RMEs for a number of v(3) transitions measured by

Abstract = {We identify new Y- and T-type brown dwarfs from the WISE All Sky data
   release using images obtained in filters that divide the traditional
   near-infrared H and J bands into two halves-specifically CH(4)s and
   CH(4)l in the H and J2, and J3 in the J. This proves to be very
   effective at identifying cool brown dwarfs via the detection of their
   methane absorption, as well as providing preliminary classification
   using methane colors and WISE -to-near-infrared colors. New and updated
   calibrations between T/Y spectral types and CH(4)s-CH(4)l J3-W2, and
   CH(4)s-W2 colors are derived, producing classification estimates good to
   a few spectral sub-types. We present photometry for a large sample of T
   and Y dwarfs in these filters, together with spectroscopy for 23 new
   ultra-cool dwarfs-2 Y dwarfs and 21 T dwarfs. We identify a further 8
   new cool brown dwarfs, which we have high confidence are T dwarfs based
   on their methane photometry. We find that, for objects observed on a 4 m
   class telescope at J-band magnitudes of similar to 20 or brighter,
   CH(4)s-CH(4)l is the more powerful color for detecting objects and then
   estimating spectral types. Due to the lower sky background in the
   J-band, the J3 and J2 bands are more useful for identifying fainter cool
   dwarfs at J greater than or similar to 22. The J3-J2 color is poor at
   estimating spectral types. But fortunately, once J3-J2 confirms that an
   object is a cool dwarf, the J3-W2 color is very effective at estimating
   approximate spectral types.},

   recorded by differential absorption spectroscopy (DAS) with a noise
   equivalent absorption of about alpha(min) approximate to 1.5 x 10(-7)

   present in natural abundance were identified by comparison with a
   spectrum of pure (CH4)-C-13 recorded in the same temperature conditions.
   About 1700 empirical values of the lower state energy level, E-emp, were
   derived from the ratios of the line intensities at 80 K and 296 K. They
   provide accurate temperature dependence for most of the absorption in

   of the corresponding lower state rotational quantum number, J(emp), to
   be close to integer values. Using an effective Hamiltonian model derived
   from a previously published ab initio potential energy surface, about
   2060 lines are rovibrationnally assigned, adding about 1660 new

be freely accessible via the TheoReTS information system (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr,
http://theorets.tsu.ru). Validation of these lists is presented throughout the present
paper. For the sample of lines where upper energies were available from published
analyses of experimental laboratory 12CH4 spectra, small empirical corrections in
positions were introduced that could be useful for future high-resolution applications.
We finally apply the TheoRetS line list to model Titan spectra as observed by VIMS
and by DISR, respectively onboard Cassini and Huygens. These data are used to
check that the TheoReTS line lists are able to model observations. We also make
comparisons with other experimental or theoretical line lists. It appears that
TheoRetS gives very reliable results better than ExoMol and even than HITRAN2012,
except around 1.6 µm where it gives very similar results. We conclude that TheoReTS
is suitable to be used for the modeling of planetary radiative transfer and photometry.
A re-analysis of spectra recorded by the DISR instrument during the descent of the
Huygens probe suggests that the CH4 mixing ratio decreases with altitude in Titan’s
stratosphere, reaching a value of above the 110 km altitude.},

Abstract = {Temperature dependence of the methane (CH4)-C-12 partition function was
   investigated up to T=3000 K. The ro-vibrational energy levels were
   calculated using high-order contact transformation (CT) method that
   permitted building accurate effective Hamiltonian models for highly
   excited vibration-rotation states from the molecular potential energy
   surface. Comparisons with variational calculations using large basis
   sets as well as convergence and extrapolation issues are discussed. The
   accuracy of the present calculations for the methane partition function
   was estimated as 1-2\% at 2000 K. This estimated error is considerably
   smaller than the difference with other calculations available in the

pages = {2},
Abstract = {The paper describes the construction of complete sets of hot methane
   lines based on accurate ab initio potential and dipole moment surfaces
   and extensive first-principle calculations. Four line lists spanning the
   {[}0-5000] cm(-1) infrared region were built at T = 500, 1000, 1500, and
   2000 K. For each of these four temperatures, we have constructed two
   versions of line lists: a version for high-resolution applications
   containing strong and medium lines and a full version appropriate for
   low-resolution opacity calculations. A comparison with available
   empirical databases is discussed in detail for both cold and hot bands
   giving a very good agreement for line positions, typically <0.1-0.5
   cm(-1) and similar to 5\% for intensities of strong lines. Together with
   numerical tests using various basis sets, this confirms the
   computational convergence of our results for the most important lines,
   which is the major issue for theoretical spectra predictions. We showed
   that transitions with lower state energies up to 14,000 cm(-1) could
   give significant contributions to the methane opacity and have to be
   systematically taken into account. Our list at 2000 K calculated up to J
   = 50 contains 11.5 billion transitions for I > 10(-29) cm mol(-1). These
   new lists are expected to be quantitatively accurate with respect to the
   precision of available and currently planned observations of
   astrophysical objects with improved spectral resolution.},

Abstract = {T Tauri stars are low mass young stars that may serve as analogs to the

   characterizing the chemical and physical processes that lead to planet
   formation. Searches for undetected molecules, particularly in the inner,
   planet forming regions of these disks are important for testing
   protoplanetary disk chemical models and for understanding the evolution
   of volatiles through the star and planet formation process. We used
   NIRSPEC on Keck 2 to perform a high resolution (lambda/Delta lambda
   similar to 25,000) L-band survey of T Tauri star GV Tau N. This object
   is one of two in which the simple organic molecules HCN and C2H2 have

Abstract = {We present a new procedure for computing a rovibrational spectrum of a

   solved, numerically exactly, by using a nested contracted basis.
   Rovibrational wavefunctions are computed in a vertical bar v >vertical
   bar J K M > basis, where vertical bar v > is a vibrational wavefunction
   and vertical bar JKM > is a symmetric top wavefunction. In turn, the
   vertical bar v > are obtained by solving a vibrational Schrodinger
   equation with basis functions that are products of contracted bend and
   stretch functions. At all stages of the calculation we exploit parity
   symmetry. The calculations are done in internal coordinates that
   facilitate the treatment of large amplitude motion. An Eckart
   molecule-fixed frame is used by numerically computing coefficients of
   the kinetic energy operator. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated
   by calculating a large number of converged J = 10 methane rovibrational

up to the tetradecad range and compared with experimental values. These shifts

of the order ∼0.01 cm−1, and could thus be used for a precise calculation of 13CH4
line positions. Rovibrational line intensities computed from the ab initio dipole
moment surfaces agree very well with those available in the HITRAN 2008 database,
at least for strong and medium lines. For both isotopologues, the first comparative
study of theoretical spectra with Jmax = 20 is presented up to the octad range.

	(ii) Transitions of (CH4)-C-13 and CH3D were systematically identified
	by comparison with DAS spectra of highly enriched (CH4)-C-13 and
	CH3D, recorded at the same temperatures. (iii) In the 1.58 mu m transparency
	window where CH3D lines contribute importantly to the methane spectrum
	at 80 K, the set of CH3D lower state energy values was completed
	by using recent DAS results for pure CH3D. The ``two temperature

	to be integer illustrates the quality of the lower state energy values.

Abstract = {The IRTF/CSHELL observations in February 2006 at L-S = 10 degrees and
   63-93 degrees W show similar to 10 ppb of methane at 45 degrees S to 7
   degrees N and similar to 3 ppb outside this region that covers the
   deepest canyon Valles Marineris. Observations in December 2009 at L-S =
   20 degrees and 0-30 degrees W included spectra of the Moon at a similar
   airmass as a telluric calibrator. A technique for extraction of the
   martian methane line from a combination of the Mars and Moon spectra has
   been developed. The observations reveal no methane with an upper limit
   of 8 ppb. The results of both sessions agree with the observations by
   Mumma et al. (Mumma, M.J. et al. {[}2009]. Science 323, 1041-1045) at
   the same season in February 2006 and are smaller than those in the PFS
   and TES maps. Production and removal of the biological methane on Mars
   do not significantly change the redox state of the atmosphere and the
   balance of hydrogen. A search for ethane at 2977 cm(-1) results in an
   upper limit of 0.2 ppb. However, this limit does not help to establish
   the origin of methane on Mars. Reanalysis of our search for SO2 using
   TEXES confirms the recently established upper limit of 0.3 ppb. Along
   with the lack of hot spots and gas vents with endogenic heat sources in
   the THEM'S observations, the very low upper limit to SO2 on Mars does
   not favor geological methane that is less abundant than SO2 in the
   outgassing from the terrestrial planets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

abstract = {In this paper we apply a recently released set of methane line parameters
	(Wang et al., 2011) to the modeling of Titan spectra in the 1.58
	mu m window at both low and high spectral resolution. We first compare
	the methane absorption based on this new set of methane data to that
	calculated from the methane absorption coefficients derived in situ
	from DISR/Huygens (Tomasko et al., 2008a; Karkoschka and Tomasko,
	2010) and from the band models of Irwin et al. (2006) and Karkoschka
	and Tomasko (2010). The Irwin et al. (2006) band model clearly underestimates
	the absorption in the window at temperature-pressure conditions representative
	of Titan's troposphere, while the Karkoschka and Tomasko (2010) band
	model gives an acceptable agreement in the whole window, overestimating
	the absorption by about 15\% in the range 6300-6500 cm(-1). We also
	find that the transmittance of Titan's atmosphere is in excellent
	agreement with that calculated from the Tomasko et al. (2008a) coefficients
	after reducing them by about 7\%. Synthetic spectra computed with
	spectral resolutions of 1.2 cm(-1) (R similar to 5400) and 0.35 cm(-1)
	(R similar to 18000) are then compared with two high-resolution Earth-based
	measurements of Titan's albedo obtained in 1982 and 1993 (with KPNO/FTS
	and IRTF/CSHELL). The new set of methane line parameters leads to
	an excellent match of all the CH3D and CH4 absorption features in
	these spectra, and permits us to derive a ratio of CH3D/CH4=(4.5
	+/- 1.0) x 10(-4) - hence a D/H ratio in methane for Titan of (1.13
	+/- 0.25) x 10(-4) - and a CO mole fraction of 40 +/- 10 ppm (from
	the KPNO/FTS dataset) and 51 +/- 7 ppm (from the IRTF/CSHELL dataset).
	We also infer constraints on the far-wing lineshape of methane lines
	of the 2v(3) band. We finally present two other examples of models
	of Titan's spectrum using the new line parameters, one potentially
	useful for future higher-resolution (R=40,000) observations, another
	one applicable to the ongoing low-resolution (R similar to 100) observations
	by Cassini VIMS. We show that the aerosol model of Tomasko et al.
	(2008b) produces too much intensity at low phase angle compared to
	a VIMS spectrum recorded near the Huygens site and we propose a slightly
	revised model that reproduces this observation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   abstract = {{After molecular nitrogen, methane is the most abundant species in Titan’s atmosphere and plays a major role in its energy budget and its chemistry. Methane has strong bands at 3.3μm emitting mainly at daytime after absorption of solar radiation. This emission is strongly affected by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) in Titan’s upper atmosphere and, hence, an accurate modeling of the non-LTE populations of the emitting vibrational levels is necessary for its analysis. We present a sophisticated and extensive non-LTE model which considers 22 CH4 levels and takes into account all known excitation mechanisms in which they take part. Solar absorption is the major excitation process controlling the population of the v3-quanta levels above 1000km whereas the distribution of the vibrational energy within levels of similar energy through collisions with N2 is also of importance below that altitude. CH4–CH4 vibrational exchange of v4-quanta affects their population below 500km. We found that the ν3→ground band dominates Titan’s 3.3μmdaytime limb radiance above 750km whereas the ν3+ν4→ν4 band does below that altitude and down to 300km. Theν3+ν2→ν2, the 2ν3→ν3, and the 13CH4 ν3→ground bands each contribute from 5% to 8% at regions below 800km. The ν3+2ν4→2ν4and ν2+ν3+ν4→ν2+ν4 bands each contribute from 2% to 5% below 650km. Contributions from other CH4 bands are negligible. We have used the non-LTE model to retrieve the CH4 abundance from 500 to 1100km in the southern hemisphere from Cassini–VIMS daytime measurements near 3.3μm. Our retrievals show good agreement with previous measurements and model results, supporting a weak deviation from well mixed values from the lower atmosphere up to 1000km.}}

	software is then used to obtain rovibrational energy levels and dipole
	transition matrix elements. This information is used to calculate

	of CH4 at 1000 K is calculated with the complete set of Einstein

Abstract = {Large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent non-premixed swirling flames
   based on the Sydney swirl burner experiments under different flame
   characteristics are used to uncover the underlying instability modes
   responsible for the centre jet precession and large scale recirculation
   zone. The selected flame series known as SMH flames have a fuel mixture
   of methane-hydrogen (50:50 by volume). The LES solves the governing
   equations on a structured Cartesian grid using a finite volume method,
   with turbulence and combustion modelling based on the localised dynamic
   Smagorinsky model and the steady laminar flamelet model respectively.
   The LES results are validated against experimental measurements and
   overall the LES yields good qualitative and quantitative agreement with
   the experimental observations. Analysis showed that the LES predicted
   two types of instability modes near fuel jet region and bluff body
   stabilised recirculation zone region. The mode I instability defined as
   cyclic precession of a centre jet is identified using the time
   periodicity of the centre jet in flames SMH1 and SMH2 and the mode II
   instability defined as cyclic expansion and collapse of the
   recirculation zone is identified using the time periodicity of the
   recirculation zone in flame SMH3. Finally frequency spectra obtained
   from the LES are found to be in good agreement with the experimentally
   observed precession frequencies.},

abstract = {One of the most puzzling aspects of Mars is that organics have not
	yet been found on the surface. The simplest of organic molecules,
	methane, was detected in the Martian atmosphere for the first time
	in 2003. The existence and behavior of methane on Mars is of great
	significance, as methane is a potential biomarker. In this paper
	we review our current understanding of possible sources and sinks
	of methane on Mars. We also investigate the role of other trace species
	in the maintenance and removal of methane from the atmosphere, as
	well as of other organic material from the surface. In particular,
	we examine the exogenous, hydrogeochemical-especially serpentinization-and
	biological sources, for supplying methane to Mars. We suggest that
	comets and meteorites are the least likely, whereas low-temperature
	serpentinization is the most plausible of all candidates to explain
	the methane observations. Nevertheless, it is premature to rule out
	the role of biology in producing methane on Mars, in view of available
	data. It is important to note that the loss of methane to surface
	must also be factored into any ``source{''} scenarios for methane.
	Ordinary heterogeneous loss process to surface tends to be very slow.
	On the other hand, a reactive surface could potentially accelerate
	the destruction of methane. If correct, it would imply that a larger
	source of methane is present than currently estimated on the basis
	of photochemical loss alone. A reactive surface can also explain
	why no organic material has ever been detected on the Martian surface.
	The surface could become reactive if some oxidizer were present.
	We suggest that vast quantities of a powerful oxidant, hydrogen peroxide,
	can be produced in electrochemistry triggered by electrostatic fields
	generated in the Martian dust devils and dust storms, and in normal
	saltation process close to the surface. Finally, current observations
	are inadequate to prove or disprove the existence of life on Mars,
	now or in the past. The question of extraterrestrial life is a fundamental
	one, and it should be addressed meticulously on future missions to
	Mars. Measurements planned on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL),
	especially carbon isotopes and chirality, will go a long way in meeting
	this goal. A brief overview of the MSL Mission and measurements relevant
	to the question of life and habitability of Mars is also presented

	in the near infrared to visible were measured by high-resolution
	interferometric Fourier transform techniques. The far-infrared data
	result in permanent electric dipole moments (\textbackslash{}mu(0)(z)\textbackslash{}=(5.69+/-0.14)x10(-3)
	D for CHD3, \textbackslash{}mu(0)(z)\textbackslash{}=(5.57+/-0.10)x10(-3)
	D for CH3D), consistent with previous experimental data. The integrated
	N=5 overtone cross section is found to be (0.828+/-0.068) fm(2).
	The overtone data are used, together with previous data, to derive
	a new, nine-dimensional, isotopically invariant dipole moment function
	for CH4 within the chromophore model for the CH chromophore in CHD3.
	With this function, the experimental data can be reproduced to an
	averaged factor of 1.2, in the best case. In the vibrational ground
	state, a nine-dimensional calculation of expectation values on a
	new, fully anharmonic potential surface was performed using the solution
	of the rovibrational Schrodinger equation by diffusion quantum Monte
	Carlo methods. The results for the rotational constants of several
	isotopomers, which include significant contributions from rovibrational
	interactions, indicate that the equilibrium CH bond length of methane
	is r(e)=108.6 pm. The calculated value for the vibrationally averaged
	permanent dipole moment from these nine-dimensional vibrational quantum
	calculations, using the dipole moment function consistent with the
	analysis of the overtone bands, is mu(0)(z) =(6.8+/-0.5)X10(-3) D
	for CHD3 (with positive z coordinate for the H atom) and mu(0)(z)=(6.8+/-0.5)X10(-3)
	D for CH3D (with positive z coordinate for the D atom) in essential
	agreement with the far-infrared rotational intensities. The sign
	could be determined unambiguously by comparison with ab initio data.
	We predict the permanent dipole moment of several further methane
	isotopomers. The polarity of the CH bond in methane is C--H+, within
	our simple bond dipole model, but is discussed to be a model dependent
	(not purely experimental) quantity.},
