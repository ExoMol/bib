Abstract = {{We present two quantum calculations of the infrared spectrum of
   protonated methane (CH5+) using fult-dimensional, ab initio-based
   potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. The calculated spectra
   compare well with a tow-resolution experimental spectrum except below
   1000 cm(-1), where the experimental spectrum shows no absorption. The
   present calculations find substantial absorption features below 1000
   cm(-1), in qualitative agreement with earlier classical calculations of
   the spectrum. The major spectral. bands are analyzed in terms of the
   molecular motions. of particular interest is an intense feature at 200
   cm(-1), which is due to an isomerization mode that connects two
   equivalent minima. Very recent high-resolution jet-cooled spectra in the
   CH stretch region (2825 to 3050 cm(-1)) are also reported, and
   assignments of the band origins are made, based on the present quantum
   calculations.}},

Pages = {1346-1349},
Abstract = {{Protonation of methane (CH4), a rather rigid molecule well described by
   quantum mechanics, produces CH5+, a prototypical floppy molecule that
   has eluded definitive spectroscopic description. Experimental
   measurement of high-resolution spectra of pure CH5+ samples poses a
   formidable challenge. By applying two types of action spectroscopy
   predicated on photoinduced reaction with CO2 and photoinhibition of
   helium cluster growth, we obtained low-temperature, high-resolution
   spectra of mass-selected CH5+. On the basis of the very high accuracy of
   the line positions, we determined a spectrum of combination differences.
   Analysis of this spectrum enabled derivation of equally accurate ground
   state-level schemes of the corresponding nuclear spin isomers of CH5+,
   as well as tentative quantum number assignment of this enfant terrible
   of molecular spectroscopy.}},

Journal = {Science},

Volume = {{309}},
Pages = {1219-1222},
Abstract = {{Protonated methane, CH5+, continues to elude definitive structural
   assignment, as large-amplitude vibrations and hydrogen scrambling
   challenge both theory,and experiment. Here, the infrared spectrum of
   bare CH5+ is presented, as detected by reaction with carbon dioxide gas
   after resonant excitation by the free electron laser at the FELIX
   facility in the Netherlands. Comparison of the experimental spectrum at
   similar to 110 kelvin to finite-temperature infrared spectra, calculated
   by ab initio molecular dynamics, supports fluxionality of bare CH5+
   under experimental conditions and provides a dynamical mechanism for
   exchange of hydrogens between CH3 tripod positions and the three-center
   bonded H-2 moiety, which eventually leads to full hydrogen scrambling.
   The possibility of artificially freezing out scrambling and internal
   rotation in the simulations allowed assignment of the infrared spectrum
   despite this pronounced fluxionality.}},

   Fluxional Molecule}},
Journal = JPCL,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {4229-4232},
Abstract = {{Protonated methane, CH5+, is the prototypical example of a fluxional
   molecular system. The almost unconstrained angular motion of its five
   hydrogen atoms results in dynamical phenomena not found in rigid or
   semirigid molecules. Here it is shown that standard concepts to describe
   rotational quantum states of molecules can not be applied to CH5+, or
   any other fluxional system of the type AB(n) or B-n with n > 4 due to
   fundamental symmetry reasons. Instead, the ro-vibrational states of CH5+
   display a unique level scheme, which results from a complex entanglement
   of rotational and tunneling motions. A detailed analysis of the
   ro-vibrational quantum states of CH5+ based on full-dimensional quantum
   dynamics simulations is presented, and the effects of the Pauli
   principle are considered. The consequences for the interpretation of
   recent experimental results are highlighted.}},

Title = {{Symmetry of extremely floppy molecules: Molecular states beyond
   rotation-vibration separation}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, molecules are theoretically described as near-static
   structures rotating in space. Vibrational motion causing small
   structural deformations induces a perturbative treatment of the
   rotation-vibration interaction, which fails in highly fluxional
   molecules, where all vibrational motions have amplitudes comparable in
   size to the linear dimensions of the molecule. An example is protonated
   methane (CH5+) {[}P. Kumar and D. Marx, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 573
   (2006); Z. Jin et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 110, 1569 (2006); and A. S.
   Petit et al., J. Phys. Chem. A 118, 7206 (2014)]. For these molecules,
   customary theory fails to simulate reliably even the low-energy spectrum
   {[}T. Oka, Science 347, 1313-1314 (2015) and O. Asvany et al., Science
   347, 1346-1349 (2015)]. Within the traditional view of rotation and
   vibration being near-separable, rotational and vibrational wavefunctions
   can be symmetry classified separately in the molecular symmetry (MS)
   group {[}P. Bunker and P. Jensen, Molecular Symmetry and Spectroscopy,
   NRC Monograph Publishing Program (NRC Research Press, 2006)]. In this
   article, we discuss a fundamental group theoretical approach to the
   problem of determining the symmetries of molecular rotation-vibration
   states. We will show that all MS groups discussed so far are isomorphic
   to subgroups of the special orthogonal group in three dimensions SO(3).
   This leads to a group theoretical foundation of the technique of
   equivalent rotations {[}H. Longuet-Higgins, Mol. Phys. 6, 445 (1963)].
   The group G(240) (the MS group of protonated methane) represents, to the
   best of our knowledge, the first example of a MS group which is not
   isomorphic to a subgroup of SO(3) (nor of O(3) or of SU(2)). Because of
   this, a separate symmetry classification of vibrational and rotational
   wavefunctions becomes impossible in this MS group, consistent with the
   fact that a decoupling of vibrational and rotational motion is
   impossible. We discuss here the consequences of this. In conclusion, we
   show that the prototypical, extremely floppy molecule CH5+ represents a
   new class of molecules, where customary group theoretical methods for
   determining selection rules and spectral assignments fail so that new
   methods have to be developed. }},
