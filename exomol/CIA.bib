abstract = {Using state-of-the-art ab initio interaction-induced dipole and potential-energy surfaces for hydrogen–helium (H2–He) pairs, we compute the rototranslational collision-induced absorption coefficient at 40-400 K for frequencies covering 0-4000 cm−1. The quantum mechanical scattering calculations account for the full anisotropic interaction potential, replacing the isotropic approximation. The absorption data are expected to be accurate with an uncertainty of 2% or better up to 2500 cm−1. The uncertainty is slightly higher at the highest frequencies where the rototranslational absorption is largely obscured by the rovibrational band. Our improved agreement with measurements at 200-800 cm−1 result from the improvement of the potential energy surface. The previously available rototranslational data set for H2–H2 pairs (Fletcher et al., Astrophys. J. Supp. 235, 24 (2018)) is also extended up to 4000 cm−1. In the rovibrational band previous isotropic potential calculations for H2–He (Gustafsson et al., J. Chem. Phys. 113, 3641 (2000)) and H2–H2 (Borysow, Icarus 92, 273 (1992)) have been extended to complement the rototranslational data set. The absorption coefficients are tabulated for ortho-to-para ratios from normal-H2 to pure para-H2, as well as equilibrium-H2, over 40-400 K . The effect of these updates are simulated for the cold atmosphere of Uranus and warmer atmosphere of Jupiter. They are equivalent to a brightness temperature difference of a fraction of a degree in the rototranslational region but up to 4 degrees in the rovibrational region. Our state-of-the-art modifications correct an otherwise +2% error in determining the He/H2 ratio in Uranus from its spectrum alone.}

Abstract = {Correct parameterization of the Collision-induced Absorption (CIA)
   phenomena is essential for accurate modeling of planetary atmospheres.
   The HITRAN spectroscopic database provides these parameters in a
   dedicated section. Here, we significantly revise and extend the HITRAN
   CIA data with respect to the original effort described in Richard et al.
   {[}JQSRT 113, 1276 (2012)]. The extension concerns new collisional pairs
   as well as wider spectral and temperature ranges for the existing pairs.
   The database now contains CIA for N-2-N-2, N-2-H-2, N-2-CH4, N-2-H2O,
   N-2-O-2, O-2-O-2, O-2-CO2, CO2-CO2, H-2-H-2, H-2-He, H-2-CH4, H-2-H,
   H-He, CH4-CH4, CH4-CO2, CH4-He, and CH4-Ar collision pairs. The sources
   of data as well as their validation and selection are discussed. A wish
   list to eliminate remaining deficiencies or lack of data from the
   astrophysics perspective is also presented.},

Pages = {{1276-1285}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the addition of Collision-Induced Absorption (CIA)
   into the HITRAN compilation. The data from different experimental and
   theoretical sources have been cast into a consistent format and
   formalism. The implementation of these new spectral data into the HITRAN
   database is invaluable for modeling and interpreting spectra of telluric
   and other planetary atmospheres as well as stellar atmospheres. In this
   implementation for HITRAN, CIAs of N-2, H-2, O-2, CO2, and CH4 due to
   various collisionally interacting atoms or molecules are presented. Some
   CIA spectra are given over an extended range of frequencies, including
   several H-2 overtone bands that are dipole-forbidden in the
   non-interacting molecules. Temperatures from tens to thousands of Kelvin
   are considered, as required, for example, in astrophysical analyses of
   objects, including cool white dwarfs, brown dwarfs. M dwarfs, cool main
   sequence stars, solar and extra-solar planets, and the formation of
   so-called first stars. }},

abstract = {The collision-induced absorption (CIA) spectra of H2-H2 and H2-He are known to play an important role for modelling of low-metallicity cool and dense stellar atmospheres. In this paper we present collision-induced absorption spectra of H2вЂ“H2 complexes in the rototranslational (О”v=0), the fundamental (О”v=1), the first (О”v=2) and the second (О”v=3) overtone bands in the temperature range from 1000 to 7000&#xa0;K, and in the frequency region from 0 to 20&#xa0;000 cmв€’1. The translational spectral density functions are computed quantum mechanically, based on: (1) the newly developed ab initio collision-induced H2вЂ“H2 dipole functions of Zheng (Computational study of collision induced dipole moments and absorption spectra of H2вЂ“H2. Ph.D. thesis, Michigan Technological University, 1997), which account for the short-range H2вЂ“H2 intermolecular distances (as small as 2.5 a.u.) and for larger \{H2\} internuclear distances (as large as 2.15 a.u.); (2) semiempirical isotropic H2вЂ“H2 potential (Ross et al, J Chem Phys 1983;79(3):1487) suitable for high temperatures. We include the collision-induced absorption coefficient of the vibrational transitions as v1,v2,vвЂІ1,vвЂІ2в‰¤3 which we computed rigorously. We also give our estimate for the collision-induced absorption coefficients of single vibrational transitions such as vi&lt;3,&#xa0;vвЂІi&gt;3 in the first and second overtone bands. The dependence of \{CIA\} spectra on rotational states of \{H2\} molecules is accounted for in our computations. We have previously (Borysow et al, Astronom Astrophys. 1997;324:185вЂ“95) studied the effect of \{CIA\} for stars of a wide range of fundamental stellar parameters (effective temperature, gravity, and chemical composition), and determined for which combinations of these parameters it is necessary to include \{CIA\} in the model and spectrum computation. These calculations showed that \{CIA\} from H2вЂ“H2 plays an important, and often even a dominating role for stellar atmospheres of a wide range of stars. The approximate character of the estimates of the H2вЂ“H2 absorption coefficient we used in our previous work combined with the large effect \{CIA\} had on the stellar atmospheres, were the main inspirations to initiate the more accurate computations of the absorption coefficient we present here. The absorption coefficient we compute in the present analysis is in qualitative agreement with our preliminary estimates (Borysow et al, Astronom Astrophys 1997;324:185вЂ“95), but in some spectral regions of high importance for the stellar structure, our computed absorption coefficient is up to a factor of 3 larger than our preliminary estimates. We therefore fully confirm our previous suspicion that H2вЂ“H2 \{CIA\} will have a pronounced effect on the atmosphere for a wide range of stars. In this paper we therefore quantify the effect the new data have on a typical cool dense stellar atmosphere, and compare our new results with our previous estimates. }
