Title = {Cyanide Molecular Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy with Current
   Databases},
Journal = {Atoms},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {This work discusses diatomic molecular spectroscopy of laser-induced
   plasma and analysis of data records, specifically signatures of cyanide,
   CN. Line strength data from various databases are compared for
   simulation of the CN, (BS+)-S-2?(XS+)-S-2, ?v = 0 sequence. Of interest
   are recent predictions using an astrophysical database, i.e., ExoMol, a
   laser-induced fluorescence database, i.e., LIFBASE, and a program for
   simulating rotational, vibrational, and electronic spectra, i.e.,
   PGOPHER. Cyanide spectra that are predicted from these databases are
   compared with line-strength data that have been in use by the author for
   the last three decades in the analysis of laser-plasma emission spectra.
   Comparisons with experimental laser-plasma records are communicated as
   well for spectral resolutions of 33 and 110 picometer. The accuracy of
   the CN line-strength data is better than one picometer. Laboratory
   experiments utilize 308 nm, 35 picosecond bursts within an overall 1
   nanosecond pulse-width, and 1064 nm, 6 ns pulse-width radiation.
   Experimental results are compared with predictions. Differences of the
   databases are elaborated for equilibrium of rotational and vibrational
   modes and at an internal, molecular temperature of the order of 8,000
   Kelvin. Applications of accurate CN data include, for example,
   combustion diagnosis, chemistry, and supersonic and hypersonic expansion
   diagnosis. The cyanide molecule is also of interest in the study of
   astrophysical phenomena.},

Title = {Lifetimes and intensities study for the gamma and beta systems of CN
   radicals extending to very high vibrational state},
Journal = {Comp. Theor. Chem.}, 
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1209},
Abstract = {The gamma (A(2)Pi-X-2 sigma(+)) and beta (B-2 sigma+-X-2 sigma+) systems
   of cyano (CN) radicals were studied using the highly correlated ab
   initio approach. The complex behavior of the excited-state wave function
   calculated at the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)
   and multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) levels has a great
   influence on the quality of the transition dipole moment curves (TDMCs).
   Combining the TDMCs and the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential curves at
   the MRCI + Q/aV5Z-DK level, the spectroscopic parameters of the higher
   vibrational bands for the gamma (v'\& nbsp;= 0-50 <- v'' = 0-53) and
   beta (v'= 0-33 <- v'' = 0-53) systems were investigated. The radiation
   lifetimes of the vibrational levels (v' = 0-15) were obtained. A list of
   wavelengths and Einstein A coefficients of the lower vibrational bands
   (v' = 0-2 <-\& nbsp; v `` = 0-2) is provided and compared with other
   results. The spectral intensities of the \& nbsp;gamma system 2-0 band
   and the beta \& nbsp; system 0-0 \& nbsp;band at different temperatures
   (300, 5000, and 10,000 K) are discussed. As the temperature increases,
   the bandwidths become broader, and the intensities decrease. These
   results are relevant for the applications in astrophysics and chemistry,
   especially in space vehicles.},

Abstract = {{First principle electronic structure calculations on low-lying doublet
   states of the CN radical have been performed using the multi-reference

   Beside the adiabatic interatomic potentials, the non-adiabatic
   spin-orbit and L-uncoupling electronic matrix elements were evaluated

   to X and A similar to B matrix elements was confirmed by comparison with
   their empirical counterparts. Both local and regular perturbations in
   the A similar to B similar to X complex were found to depend mostly on
   spin-orbit and electronic-rotational interactions between the lowest
   A(2)Pi, and B-2 Sigma(+) states. Excited states, in all their diversity,
   have little effect on the fine structure of the A similar to B complex,

pages = {4383-4395},
abstract = {Accurate line lists are important for the description of the spectroscopic
nature of small molecules. While a line list for CN (an important molecule for chemistry
and astrophysics) exists, no underlying energy spectroscopic model has been published,
which is required to consider the sensitivity of transitions to a variation of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio. Here we have developed a Duo energy spectroscopic
model as well as a novel hybrid style line list for CN and its isotopologues,
combining energy levels that are derived experimentally (Marvel), using the
traditional/perturbative approach (Mollist), and the variational approach (from
a Duo spectroscopic model using standard ExoMol methodology). The final Trihybrid
ExoMol-style line list for 12C14N consists of 28 004 energy levels (6864 experimental,
1574 perturbative, the rest variational) and 2285 103 transitions up to 60 000 cm−1
between the three lowest electronic states (X 2Σ+, A 2Π, and B 2Σ+). The spectroscopic
model created is used to evaluate CN as a molecular probe to constrain the variation
of the proton-to-electron mass ratio; no overly promising sensitive transitions
for extragalactic study were identified},

Title = {{Temperature inversions on hot super-Earths: the case of CN in
   nitrogen-rich atmospheres}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {500},
Pages = {2197-2208},
Abstract = {We show that in extremely irradiated atmospheres of hot super-Earths
   shortwave absorption of CN can cause strong temperature inversions. We
   base this study on previous observations of 55 Cancri e, which lead us
   to believe that ultrashort-period super-Earths can sustain volatile
   atmospheres, rich in nitrogen and/or carbon. We compute our model
   atmospheres in a radiative-convective equilibrium for a variety of
   nitrogen-rich cases and orbital parameters. We demonstrate the effects
   caused by thermal inversions on the chemistry and compute low-resolution
   synthetic emission spectra for a range of 0.5-28 mu m. Our results
   indicate that due to shortwave absorption of CN, atmospheres with
   temperatures above 2000 K and C/O >= 1.0 are prone to thermal
   inversions. CN is one of the few molecules that is extremely stable at
   large temperatures occurring on the dayside of short-period
   super-Earths. The emission spectrum of such atmospheres will differ
   substantially from non-inverted cases. In the case of inversions,
   absorption features become inverted, showing higher than expected flux.
   We propose that inversions in hot atmospheres should be the expected
   norm. Hot super-Earths are some of the most extreme natural laboratories
   for testing predictions of atmospheric chemistry and structure. They are
   frequently occurring, bright in emission and have short orbital periods.
   All these factors make them perfect candidates to be observed with JWST
   and ARIEL missions.},

Title = {{Depolarizing isotropic collisions of the CN solar molecule with electrons}},
Journal = {Res. Astron. Astrophys.},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
pages = {210},
Abstract = {Existence of linear polarization, formed by anisotropic scattering in
   the photosphere, has been demonstrated observationally as well as
   theoretically and is called second solar spectrum (SSS). The SSS is
   distinguished by its structure, which is rich in terms of information.
   In order to analyze the SSS, it is necessary to evaluate the
   (de)polarizing effect of isotropic collisions between CN solar molecules
   and electrons or neutral hydrogen atoms. This work is dedicated to
   calculations of the polarization transfer rates associated with
   CN-electron isotropic collisions. We show that usual rates serve as a
   proxy for polarization transfer rates. Then, we take advantage of
   available usual excitation collisional rates obtained via sophisticated
   quantum methods in order to derive the polarization transfer rates for
   the X (2)Sigma(+)- B (2)Sigma(+) (violet) and X (2)Sigma(+)-A (2 Pi)
   (red) systems of CN. Our approach is based on the infinite order sudden
   (IOS) approximation and can be applied for other solar molecules. We
   discuss the effectiveness of collisions with electrons on the SSS of the
   CN lines. Our results contribute to reducing the degree of complication
   in modeling the formation of the SSS of CN.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {733},
Pages = {6},
Abstract = {We have carried out a multi-species study of a region which has had
   previous measurements of strong magnetic fields through the CN Zeeman
   effect in order to explore the relationship between CN and N(2)H(+),
   both of which have evidence that they remain in the gas phase at
   densities of 10(5)-10(6) cm(-3). To achieve this, we map the 1 arcmin(2)
   region around the UCHII region of W3(OH) using the Combined Array for
   Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). Approximately 105 hr of data were
   collected in multiple array configurations to produce maps with an
   effective resolution of similar to 2 `'.5 at high signal-to-noise ratios
   (S/Ns) in CN, C(18)O, HCN, HCO(+), N(2)H(+), and two continuum bands
   (91.2 GHz and 112 GHz). These data allow us to compare tracer molecules
   associated with both low-and high-density regions to infer gas
   properties. We determine that CARMA resolves out approximately 35\% of
   the CN emission around W3(OH) when compared with spectra obtained from
   the IRAM 30 m telescope. The presence of strong absorption lines toward
   the continuum source in three of the molecular transitions infers the
   presence of a cold, dark, optically thick region in front of the
   continuum source. In addition, the presence of high-velocity emission
   lines near the continuum source shows the presence of hot clumpy
   emission behind the continuum source. These data determine that future
   high-resolution interferometric CN Zeeman measurements which cannot
   currently be performed (due to technical limitations of current
   telescopes) are feasible. We confirm that CN is indeed a good tracer for
   high-density regions; with certain objects such as W3(OH) it appears to
   be a more accurate tracer than N(2)H(+).},

   2007}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {522},
Pages = {A82},
Abstract = {Aims. On October 24, 2007 the comet 17P/Holmes underwent an outburst
   that was extraordinary in both duration and size. We attempted to
   determine the cause of the outburst by acquiring and analyzing high
   resolution spectra of the comet.
   Methods. On two nights, October 25 and December 2, we acquired four high
   resolution spectra in the visible range at the Telescopio Nazionale
   Galileo in La Palma. The oxygen lines intensity ratio was estimated for
   the observation performed on October 25, and computed for the
   observation performed on December 2.
   Results. Many emission lines were detected in the spectra, most of them
   attributable to C(2), NH(2), CN and CH. The atomic O green line and one
   of the red doublet lines were detected in a spectrum acquired on October
   25. All the three atomic O lines were detected in a spectrum acquired on
   December 2. The value obtained for the first night, 0.1 +/- 0.11,
   implies that the H(2)O molecule was the main parent of the emission
   lines, while the value obtained for the second night, 0.3 +/- 0.1,
   implies that the main parent was CO or CO(2) instead than H(2)O.
   Conclusions. Our results imply that in the days around the outburst the
   water production was exceptionally high for that heliocentric distance.
   By December, however, the behavior of 17P/Holmes had returned to that of
   a comet orbiting at 2.6 AU from the Sun, in which state the activity is
   probably sustained mostly by gases more volatile than water, such as CO
   and CO(2).},

   Galactic globular clusters I. CH and CN band strength variations}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {524},
Pages = {A44},
Abstract = {Context. Globular clusters show star-to-star abundance variations for
   light elements that are not yet well understood. The preferred
   explanation involves a self-enrichment scenario, within which two
   subsequent generations of stars co-exist in globular clusters.
   Observations of chemical abundances in the main sequence and sub-giant
   branch stars allow us to investigate the signature of this chemically
   processed material without the complicating effects caused by stellar
   evolution and internal mixing.
   Aims. Our main goal is to investigate the carbon-nitrogen
   anti-correlation with low-resolution spectroscopy of 20-50 stars fainter
   than the first dredge-up in seven Galactic globular clusters (NGC 288,
   NGC 1851, NGC 5927, NGC 6352, NGC 6388, and Pal 12) with different
   properties. We complemented our observations with 47 Tuc archival data,
   with four additional clusters from the literature (M 15, M 22, M 55, NGC
   362), and with additional literature data on NGC 288.
   Methods. In this first paper, we measured the strengh of the CN and CH
   band indices, which correlate with the N and C abundances, and we
   investigated the anti-correlation and bimodality of these indices. We
   compared r(CN), the ratio of stars belonging to the CN-strong and weak
   groups, with 15 different cluster parameters.
   Results. We clearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the CH and CN band
   stregths in the metal-rich clusters (Pal 12, 47 Tuc, NGC 6352, NGC
   5927). Only M 15 among the metal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal
   anti-correlation. We found weak correlations (sligthly above 1 sigma) of
   rCN with the cluster orbital parameters, present-day total mass, cluster
   concentration, and age.
   Conclusions. Our findings support the self-enrichment scenario, and
   suggest that the occurrence of more than two major generations of stars
   in a GGC should be rare. Small additional generations (< 10-20\% of the
   total) would be difficult to detect with our samples. The first
   generation, which corresponds to the CN-weak stars, usually contains
   more stars than the second one (< rCN > = 0.82 +/- 0.29), as opposed to
   results based on the Na-O anti-correlations.},

Abstract = {Rotational excitation of the CN(X (2)Sigma(+)) molecule with He is
   investigated. We present a new two-dimensional potential energy surface
   (PES) for the He-CN system, calculated at an internuclear CN distance
   frozen at its experimental equilibrium distance. This PES was obtained
   using an open-shell, coupled-cluster method including all single and
   double excitations, as well as the perturbative contributions of
   connected triple excitations {[}RCCSD(T)]. Bond functions were placed at
   mid-distance between the center of mass of the CN molecule and He atom
   for a better description of the van der Waals interaction.
   State-to-state collisional excitation cross sections of the
   fine-structure levels of CN by He are calculated for energies up to 2500
   cm(-1), which yield after thermal averaging, rate coefficients up to 350
   K. The exact spin splitting of the energy levels is taken into account.
   The propensity rules between fine-structure levels are studied, and it
   is shown that the rate constants for Delta j=Delta N transitions are
   much larger than those for Delta j not equal Delta N transitions, as
   expected from theoretical considerations. Our calculated rate
   coefficients are compared to experimental results at 295 K of Fei {[}J.
   Chem. Phys. 100, 1190 (1994)]. The excellent agreement confirms the
   accuracy of the PESs and of the scattering calculations.},

Abstract = {Rate constants for collisional loss and transfer of population and

   CN(A(2)Pi, nu = 4) + Ar system. Aligned samples of CN(A(2)Pi , nu = 4,
   F(1), j = 1.5-23.5e) were prepared by optical pumping on the A-X(4,0)
   band. Their evolution was observed using Doppler-resolved
   frequency-modulated spectroscopy in stimulated emission on the A-X(4,2)
   band. State-resolved total population removal rate constants, and
   state-to-state rotational energy transfer (RET) rate constants, are
   found to be in excellent agreement with previous experimental
   measurements and theoretical predictions for the nu = 3 level. Rapid
   elastic depolarization of rotational alignment was observed for j =
   1.5-6.5, with an average rate constant of 1.1 x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1).
   This declines with increasing j, reaching zero within experimental error
   for j = 23.5. The polarization transfer efficiency of the initially
   created alignment in state-to-state RET was also determined for the
   selected initial state j = 6.5, F(1), e. Substantial depolarization of
   the alignment was observed for small Dj transitions. Alignment transfer
   efficiencies ranged from 0.55 +/- 0.06 for Delta j = -1, to 0.32 +/-
   0.08 for Delta j = +3. These measurements are discussed with reference
   to recent experimental and theoretical advances on collisional
   depolarization of related open-shell species. We suggest that the
   surprisingly efficient collisional depolarization observed may be the
   result of the multiple potential energy surfaces involved in this
   system.},

   Ti:sapphire ring laser operating near 10 900 cm(-1). The sample was
   exposed to a weak, frequency-modulated probe beam and a strong,
   counter-propagating bleach laser beam. Demodulated probe laser signals
   display absorption and dispersion features derived from Doppler-free
   saturation of the hyperfine components as the laser scans across the
   central region of a Doppler-broadened rotational line spectrum.
   Hyperfine-resolved transition frequencies were combined with known
   ground-state X(2)Sigma hyperfine term values to determine A(2)Pi state
   hyperfine term values, which were analyzed in terms of an effective
   Hamiltonian for the A(2)Pi state. All the expected hyperfine and (14)N

   radical. Higher sensitivity obtained with 400 kHz amplitude modulation
   of the bleach laser and additional phase-sensitive detection allowed
   hyperfine splittings in some rotational lines of (13)C(14)N to be

   transitions in the spectra of CN and isoelectronic species}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {258},
Pages = {6-12},
Abstract = {Based on high-level ab initio calculations, we predict the existence of
   a strong (4)Sigma(+)-(4)Sigma(+) optical transition (d(av) = 1.6 D) near
   328 nm (T(00) = 30460 cm(-1)), analogous to the
   B(2)Sigma(+)-X(2)Sigma(+) violet system, (d(av) = 1.7 D) in the
   near-ultraviolet spectrum of CN. The lower state of the predicted
   transition is the lowest-lying state of quartet multiplicity and has
   been observed previously through its perturbations of the B state. The
   predicted transition will enable determination of the equilibrium
   properties of the metastable lowest quartet state of CN. The lowest
   energy metastable sextet state of CN is also calculated to be
   quasi-bound (r(e) = 1.76 angstrom,omega(e) = 365 cm(-1)), and a
   (6)Sigma(+)-(6)Sigma(+) transition, analogous to those for the doublet
   and quartet multiplicities, is predicted (d(av) = 2.2 D). Investigation
   of the isoelectronic BO, C(2)(-), and N(2)(+) molecules reveals that
   differences in 2s(2)2p(x) and 2s(1)2p(x+1) atomic energies play the key
   role in determining the magnitude of the 5 sigma(2p) <- 4
   sigma(2s)-derived Sigma(+)-Sigma(+) transition energies for the
   different multiplicities. Furthermore, the strong stabilization of
   2s(2)2p(x) character with respect to 2s(1)2p(x+1) in BO and N(2)(+)
   leads to strongly bound lowest (6)Sigma(+) states with binding energies
   as high as 2.0 eV. We believe that these newly predicted sextet states
   could be identified through their perturbations of quartet states of the
   relevant molecules. },

   microwave discharge flow of Ar was investigated based on the CN(B-2
   Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+)) emission-spectroscopic and the
   electrostatic-probe measurements. By passing Ar and BrCN through P2O5,
   the contamination of H2O molecules into the reaction region was reduced
   to approximate to 30\%, being confirmed by monitoring the reduction of
   the OH(A(2)Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi) emission intensity. The variation of the
   CN(B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+)) emission intensity on the pressure of Ar,
   P-Ar, of 0.1-0.3 Torr was compared with that of the density of electrons
   whose kinetic energy was lower than the ionization energy of BrCN, 11.9
   eV. The dissociation of BrCN was found to proceed predominantly via the
   charge transfer from Ar+ followed by the BrCN+ - e(-) recombination.
   When the contamination of H2O molecules in the reaction region was not
   reduced, the dissociation via the energy transfer from metastable Ar
   atoms became significant. The present study shows that the contamination
   of H2O molecules in the reaction system makes significant effect onto
   the gas-phase plasma process.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},

Pages = {339-349},
Abstract = {Context. The second solar spectrum resulting from coherent scattering is
   a main tool for diagnostics of turbulent magnetic fields on the Sun.
   Scattering on diatomic molecules plays an important role in forming this
   spectrum and even dominates in some spectral regions.
   Aims. In a magnetic field electronic states of a molecule are often
   perturbed via the Paschen-Back effect. Sometimes this perturbation can
   completely change the spectrum, not only quantitatively, but even
   qualitatively. Here we calculate molecular scattering properties taking
   into account the Paschen-Back effect.
   Methods. Starting with the Hund's case (a) wave functions as a basis we
   obtain with the perturbation theory wave functions of the intermediate
   Hund's case (a-b) in a magnetic field. Using new, perturbed values of
   the Lande factors and transition amplitudes we calculate the Mueller
   matrix for coherent scattering at diatomic molecules in the intermediate
   Hund's case (a-b) and look for the effects that can be caused by the
   Paschen-Back effect.
   Results. We have found a considerable deviation from the Zeeman regime
   and discuss here the quantitative and qualitative effects on observed
   polarization signals for the CN B-2 Sigma-X-2 Sigma and MgH
   B'(2)Sigma-X-2 Sigma systems as examples.},

Pages = {041103},
Abstract = {We present the first results from a novel experimental approach to the
   measurement of state-to-state differential scattering cross-sections for
   inelastic scattering of electronically excited CN A(2)Pi with Ar.
   Photodissociation of ICN with linearly polarized 266 nm radiation
   generates CN X-2 Sigma(+) (upsilon(')=0,J(')) with a near mono-energetic
   speed distribution and large anisotropy. Saturated optical pumping of
   the nascent CN X-2 Sigma(+) transfers this speed distribution without
   distortion to selected rotational quantum states of the A(2)Pi
   (upsilon(')=4) level. The products of rotational energy transfer within
   the A(2)Pi (upsilon(')=4) level into the J(')=0.5, F-2, f, state are
   probed using frequency modulated stimulated emission spectroscopy on the
   A-X (4,2) band with a single frequency external cavity tunable diode
   laser. Doppler profiles of transitions from individual rotational,
   spin-orbit and lambda doublet specific levels are acquired for different
   geometrical arrangements of photolysis polarization and probe
   propagation directions. The resulting Doppler profiles, which for this
   J(')=0.5 state cannot display a rotational angular momentum alignment,
   are combined to yield composite Doppler profiles depending on speed and
   translational anisotropy, which are analyzed to determine fully
   state-to-state resolved differential scattering cross-sections. },

Pages = {191101},
Abstract = {The rotational spectrum of the molecular negative ion CN(-) has been
   detected in the laboratory at high resolution. The four lowest
   transitions were observed in a low pressure glow discharge through
   C(2)N(2) and N(2). Conclusive evidence for the identification was
   provided by well-resolved nitrogen quadrupole hyperfine structure in the
   lowest rotational transition, and a measurable Doppler shift owing to
   ion drift in the positive column of the discharge. Three spectroscopic
   constants (B, D, and eQq) reproduce the observed spectrum to within one
   part in 10(7) or better, allowing the entire rotational spectrum to be
   calculated well into the far IR to within 1 km s(-1) in equivalent
   radial velocity. CN(-) is an excellent candidate for astronomical
   detection, because the CN radical is observed in many galactic molecular
   sources, the electron binding energy of CN(-) is large, and calculations
   indicate CN(-) should be detectable in IRC+10216-the carbon star where
   C(6)H(-) has recently been observed. The fairly high concentration of
   CN(-) in the discharge implies that other molecular anions containing
   the nitrile group may be within reach.},

   values of the rotationally selected rate coefficients (k(reac,Ni)) for

Abstract = {The effect of bulk water on the B (2)Sigma(+) <- X (2)Sigma(+) and A
   (2)Pi <- X (2)Sigma(+) electronic transitions of the cyano radical is
   investigated. First, the cyano radical-water dimer is characterized to
   understand the nature of the interactions and parametrize molecular
   mechanics (MM) potentials. The carbon atom, which hosts the unpaired
   electron, is found to have a Lennard-Jones radius smaller than typical
   force fields values. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) is then used to
   sample water configurations around the radical, employing two sets of MM
   parameters for the cyano radical and water. Subsequently, vertical
   excitation energies are calculated using time-dependent density
   functional theory (TD-DFT) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with
   single and double substitutions (EOM-CCSD). The effect of water is
   modeled by point charges used in the MD simulations. It is found that
   both bands blue-shift with respect to their gas phase position; the
   magnitude of the shift is only weakly dependent on the method and the MM
   parameter set used. The calculated shifts are analyzed in terms of the
   solute-solvent interactions in the ground and excited states.
   Significant contributions come from valence repulsion and
   electrostatics. Consequences for experiments on ICN photodissociation in

   transfer (k(i -> f)) between levels N-i and other rotational levels N-f

   sources: (a) the pulsed laser photolysis of ICN at 266 nm, which
   generates translationally `hot' CN radicals; and (b) the pulsed laser
   photolysis of NCNO at 570 nm, which generates CN radicals with
   translational energies close to the average value at 298 K. Comparison
   of the values of k(tot),(Ni) obtained using these two sources of CN
   demonstrates: firstly, that the same results are obtained as long as
   time is allowed for the translationally hot CN radicals generated from
   ICN to be thermalised before radicals are promoted to a specific
   rotational level in v = 2 using a tuneable infrared `pump' laser
   operating at ca. 2.45 mu m; and secondly, that the rate coefficients
   decrease, but the averaged cross-sections remain approximately constant,
   as the excess translational energy in CN radicals is moderated by
   collisions. With NCNO as the source of CN radicals, the observed values
   of k(tot),(Ni) do not depend on the delay between the pulses from the
   photolysis and pump lasers. Finally, we demonstrate that, for the

   state-to-state rate coefficients, Sigma(f) k(i -> f), for rotational

   the value of k(tot),(Ni) for total transfer from the same initial level.
   The values of k(tot),(Ni) and of the state-to-state rate coefficients
   are compared with similar, earlier, results in which helium and argon
   were the collision partners. The relevance of these results to the study

   formulation of badger's rule for universal use}},
Journal = SCAA,

Pages = {3013-3023},
Abstract = {Geometries and harmonic vibrational wave numbers were calculated on a
   series of simple compounds that contain the atoms of elements in the
   groups 14-17 by density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2pd)
   level. The calculated wave numbers agree well with the observed harmonic
   wave numbers with substantially the same accuracy for the compounds of
   the different groups. The stretching force constants of the CX (X = C,
   Si, Ge, N, P, As, O, S, Se, F, Cl and Br) single and multiple bonds were
   obtained. The CX stretching force constants increase with a decrease of
   the bond lengths as the element X in the same period goes from left to
   right in the periodic table. The individual intrinsic properties of the
   CX bonds are lost gradually with increasing the period of the element X.
   The unified interpretation of Badger's rule has enabled the formulation
   of a common equation for universal use f = 2.8R(-3) to relate the force
   constants f(10(2) Nm(-1)) and the reduced bond lengths R (10(-10) m).},

Abstract = {A source of possible error, not previously considered, in the

   T<INF>g</INF><SUP>(CN) from interstellar CN absorption is proposed. This
   concerns the intrinsic assumption of the validity of using Honl-London
   rotational line intensity factors to determine the rotational components
   of the oscillator strengths of the R(0), R(1), and P(1) lines of the CN
   B2S+-X2S+ (0,0) transition. Published data on interstellar CN absorption
   shows that T</SUP><INF>g</INF><SUP>(CN) is slightly greater than the
   standard cosmological CBR temperature, T</SUP><INF>g</INF>(COBE) = 2.725
   K, determined by the COBE satellite, even when local excitation effects
   of CN are taken into account. From this difference, an estimation was
   made of the maximum corrections, a few percent, to the ratio of the line
   strengths and to the ratio of the Honl-London factors. Fluorescence
   lifetime data were shown to give similar values for the corrections as
   well as providing evidence for intramolecular coupling between the
   relevant B2S+ state rotational levels and close-lying levels of the A2P
   state, this being responsible for rendering the standard Honl-London

   investigate their diagnostic capabilities. We also compare the synthetic
   profiles with observations. Spectra of TiO, OH and FeH are found to be
   interesting diagnostics of sunspot magnetic fields. This is also true
   for cool stars, where, however, the OH Stokes V profiles may require
   very high S/N data to be reliably employed. Finally we investigate the
   potential of various molecular bands for high-contrast imaging of the
   solar surface. The violet CN and CH bands turn out to be most promising
   for imaging the photosphere, the TiO bands are excellent for imaging
   sunspot umbrae, while the UV OH band can be used for imaging both the

Abstract = {Spectroscopic observations at 1565 nm were made in the eastern half of

   blend at 1565.1 nm varies with the observed continuum temperature; the
   variation fits previous observations except that the continuum
   temperature is lower by 600 K. The equivalent width of the OH absorption
   line at 1565.2 nm shows a temperature dependence similar to previously
   published umbral molecular observations at 640 nm. A simple model of
   expected OH abundance based upon an ionization analogy to molecular
   dissociation is produced and agrees well with the temperature variation
   of the line equivalent width. A CN absorption line at 1564.6 nm shows a
   very different temperature dependence, likely due to complicated
   formation and destruction processes. Nonetheless a numerical fit of the
   temperature variation of the CN equivalent width is presented. Finally a
   comparison of the Zeeman splitting of the Fe I 1564.8 nm line with the
   sunspot temperature derived from the continuum intensity shows an umbra
   somewhat cooler for a given magnetic field strength than previous
   comparisons using this infrared 1564.8 nm line, but consistent with
   these previous infrared measurements the umbra is hotter for a given
   magnetic field strength than magnetic and temperature measurements at
   630.2 nm would suggest. Differences between the 630.2 nm and 1564.8 nm
   umbral temperature and magnetic field relations are explained with the
   different heights of formation of the lines and continua at these

Abstract = {Measurements on interstellar CN absorption are presented for stars in

   of the (1, 0) and (2, 0) bands of the A (2)Pi-X (2)Sigma(+) red system
   are used to derive Doppler parameters and total column densities.
   Inferred CN column densities vary by more than an order of magnitude for
   lines of sight with similar CN column densities. Observations of the (0,
   0) band of the CH B (2)Sigma(-) -X (2)Pi system are used to revise
   previously published CH column densities toward the lines of sight
   studied in CN. Together with earlier results on CH, CH(+), and C(2), the
   CN data presented here provide a homogeneous set of column densities and
   radial velocities of diatomic molecules in three individual translucent
   clouds. We use these data to study CN production via chemical models.
   Gas densities are inferred from models based on production via CH and
   C(2) in cool gas. Most sightlines in our sample test densities typical
   for diffuse molecular gas (a few hundred cm(-3)) when the ultraviolet
   flux permeating the gas is between 1 and 5 times the average
   interstellar flux. A few lines of sight indicate that CN is produced
   under dark cloud conditions because relatively large densities are
   obtained or because this simple chemical scheme is unable to reproduce
   the observed CN columns. Low densities are indicated for directions with
   upper limits on CN. We add an ad hoc component of a number of
   low-velocity (<10 km s(-1)) criss-crossing MHD shocks to explain
   observed column densities of interstellar CH(+). These shocks also
   produce about 10 to 30\% of the total CH column along the line of sight.},

Pages = {516-533},
Abstract = {Scaled Feynman diagrams are proposed as perturbative corrections to the
   total energy. The proposal is tested by calculating potential energy
   curves for the valence states of the cyano radical. Unique features of
   the valence state are part of the starting approximation. The latter is
   computed with a standard quantum chemical method. For a particular
   method, the scale is independent of the valence state. At each bond
   distance, one set of quasiparticles and Feynman diagrams is used for all
   valence states. Scaling will be useful whenever perturbative corrections
   can be expressed with Feyman diagrams. In the cyano radical, competition
   for the odd electron between the sigma and pi orbitals produces a
   variety of valence states. Many are quasidegenerate. The 16 states
   investigated here are doublets and quartets with triple bonds, double
   bonds, `resonance' bonds, bonds intermediate to double and triple bonds,
   and bonds intermediate to single and double bonds. Energy curves and
   spectroscopic constants are reported for the lowest lying quartets and
   two or more lowest doublets of Sigma(+/-), Pi, and Delta symmetries, and
   also 1(2)Phi symmetry. Inner and outer minima in the energy curve for
   3(2)Pi are assigned to H and G, respectively. A more accurate assignment

   errors in bond distance, frequency, and the adiabatic excitation energy

Abstract = {The host-guest charge transfer absorption of CN doped krypton and xenon
   matrices are identified through direct analogy with the previously
   assigned transitions of Cl/Kr and Cl/Xe. These intense, structured
   absorption bands appear with the onset at 245 nm in Kr and 360 nm in Xe.
   Excitation of the CN/Kr charge transfer band at 193 nm leads to emission
   over CN(A((2)Pi)-->X((2)Sigma)) transition, indicating that an efficient
   curve crossing precludes the ionic state from radiating. No emissions
   were seen in CN/Xe when excited at 193 nm. The charge transfer
   absorption spectrum of CN/Kr is reproduced through an extended
   diatomics-in-ionic-systems treatment, using accurate ab initio pair
   potentials and transition dipoles as input, without further adjustment.
   The delocalized hole states are then analyzed in real-space, using
   atomic bases distributed over as many as eleven shells surrounding the
   CN- center. The ionic states are well described as J=1/2, 3/2 valence
   bands bound to CN-, with a substructure that cannot be exclusively
   assigned to a single quantum number. The strong absorptions terminate on
   states in which 70\%-95\% of the hole density remains on the first

   R=8 Angstrom. In higher ionic states, with weaker transition dipoles,
   the hole density maximizes on shells removed by 10 Angstrom from the
   ionic center. Although these delocalized states provide channels for
   charge separation via self-trapping of holes, save for a weak signal
   from the impurity trapped hole at H+ centers, the experiments do not
   provide evidence for significant charge separation. },

Abstract = {Cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) was used for measuring absolute
   concentration profiles of the CN (cyano) radical during oxyacetylene
   flame deposition of diamond. Profiles were measured for three different
   nitrogen additions to the flame. Novel ways for the determination of the
   lateral position of the laser beam and its height above the deposition
   substrate are presented. Measured column density profiles show that the
   influence of added nitrogen is limited to a central area within a radius
   of 2.7 mm. Outside this area the profiles are hardly influenced by the
   added nitrogen flow. Comparison with work of S. J. Firchow and K. L.
   Menningen {[}J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 32, 937 (1999)] shows a good
   correspondence. Absolute concentration profiles were obtained by
   applying Abel inversion processing and using a temperature distribution
   resulting from numerical simulations. The resulting profiles show an
   off-axis maximum for all three nitrogen additions. With an increasing
   nitrogen addition the maximum and central concentrations also increased.
   Upon inspection of the profiles it follows that the gas phase above the
   deposition area can be divided into three sections: a central one in
   which the added nitrogen is the dominant nitrogen source, an outer one
   where the nitrogen from the ambient plays a dominant role, and an
   intermediate zone where both nitrogen sources have a significant
   influence. The latter is the area in which the maximum of the CN
   concentration is situated. Previous laser-induced fluorescence (LIF)
   profiles of CN, measured under very similar experimental conditions,
   show similar distributions. Differences between the CRDS and LIF results
   are discussed. },

   double resonance technique. Specific levels of CN(A(2)Pi,nu=3,N=60-63)
   were prepared by excitation of the photolytically generated radical with
   a pulsed dye laser on various rotational lines in the
   A(2)Pi-X(2)Sigma(+) (3,0) band, and collisionally populated levels in
   the nu(A) = 3 and the nearly isoenergetic nu(X) = 7 vibronic manifolds
   were probed after a short delay by laser fluorescence excitation in the
   B-X (3,7) and B-A (3,3) bands. Final state distributions (relative
   state-to-state rate constants) are reported for CN(A)-Ar collisions; the
   rate constants for transitions induced by He were considerably smaller.
   Absolute total removal rate constants were also determined. A crossing
   of the A(2)Pi nu=3 F(1)f rotational/fine-structure manifold with the
   X(2)Sigma(+) nu=7 F-2 levels occurs at J = 62.5. The dependence of A -->
   X rate constants and the total removal rate constants on the initial
   level demonstrates the importance of this ``gateway{''} in facilitating
   collisions between these manifolds. The experimental CN(A)-Ar rate
   constants have been compared with theoretical rate constants computed in
   a quantum scattering treatment of the dynamics based on ab initio
   CN(A,X)-Ar potential energy surfaces. The small non-Born-Oppenheiiner
   mixing of the A and X states in the isolated CN molecule was also
   included in the calculations. The computed total removal rates show an
   enhanced value for the perturbed N = 62 F(1)f initial level, in
   agreement with experiment, but the computed state-to-state rate
   constants do not agree well with the experimentally determined values.},

   C-2 is produced by the 193 nm multiphoton photolysis of C2Cl4. The CN
   (B-X) (0,0) and (1,1) chemiluminescence is used as the diagnostic. The
   C-2 consumption rate coefficients are measured under pseudo-first-order
   conditions and are found to be independent of pressure in the 5-200 mbar
   domain. They yield k(292-968 K) = 4.3 x 10(-11) exp(89 K/T) cm(3)
   molecule(-1) s(-1) with a 2sigma precision limit of +/-5\%. and a
   corresponding estimated accuracy limit of +/-20\%. The slight negative
   activation energy is indicative of intermediate complex formation. The
   results are compared to the C-2 + NO measurements by Kruse and Roth for
   the 3150-3950 K temperature range and confirm that a mechanism change
   occurs between the two respective temperature ranges. In the present
   work, under otherwise constant conditions the CN(B-X) emission intensity
   increases with bath gas Ar pressure in the 5 to 100 mbar domain and
   decreases with further Ar addition. This increase in CN(B) population is
   likely, at least in part, due not only to collision-induced internal
   conversion from CN A and X state molecules, but also collision-induced
   intersystem crossing from CN quartet state molecules.},

   data, CN(A)+H(2) collisional energy transfer was examined at
   temperatures near 10 K. The product state distributions resulting from

   distributions resulting from predissociation. It is argued that the lack
   of symmetry preferences in the predissociation dynamics is indicative of
   a resonant scattering process. Qualitative differences in the
   predissociation and collisional transfer dynamics can be explained by
   considering the symmetry properties of the intermolecular potential
   energy surfaces, and the regions of these surfaces that are sampled by
   each type of event. Most predissociation data was recorded for ortho

   photolysis of BrCN diluted in slowly flowing argon at a total pressure
   of similar to 0.9 Torr. Specific levels of CN(A (2)Pi,upsilon = 3,N =

   fluorescence excitation in the B (2)Sigma(+)-A (2)Pi(3,3) band. Final

   treatment of the dynamics with ab initio CN(A (2)Pi)-Ar potential energy
   surfaces. The agreement of measured and computed rate constants is very
   good. The rate constants display dramatic Lambda-doublet propensities

   examination of coupled-state partial cross sections as a function of the
   projection quantum number specifying the angle of approach of the Ar

Abstract = {The analyses of high resolution infrared spectra have been done for CN
   lines in oxygen-rich cool evolved stars including 2 K giants, 20 M
   giants and 1 S-type star. Since CN lines analyzed in the present work
   are weak and resolved well, they are appropriate for quantitative
   analyses. CN lines of Delta nu = -2 and -1 sequences (red system) which
   are in the K-and the H-window regions, respectively, give the consistent
   nitrogen abundance for each star. The analyses of NH lines in the
   L-window region have been done for 5 late M giants for which CN lines
   have been also analyzed. Although the triplet structure of NH lines
   cannot be fully resolved, they are preferable because determination of
   nitrogen abundance is almost independent of other elemental abundances
   while nitrogen abundance based on CN depends on carbon abundance. The
   nitrogen abundances derived from NH for late M giants agree well with
   those from CN for which we adopt 7.75 eV as the dissociation energy in
   the analysis.
   The results show that the nitrogen abundances in late M giants are
   larger than those in early M giants while decrease of the carbon
   abundance was found in late M giants by our previous work (Tsuji 1991).
   These variations of abundances can not be explained by the first
   dredge-up model but require additional processing by the CN cycle and
   mixing after the first dredge-up. However, there is no obvious evidence
   of other processes such as the 3 alpha-process and subsequent hot bottom
   burning in our program stars. Such variation of the carbon and nitrogen
   abundances is not well understood by the present evolutionary models of
   low-mass and intermediate-mass stars.},

   overlapping sets of nine disjoint 70 Angstrom regions of the green,
   yellow, and red. The continuum signal-to-noise ratio is in the range
   40-100 per spectral resolution element. We used line lists from the
   standard astronomical literature to identify lines of {[}O I], Na I,
   C-2, NH2, CN, and H2O+, we unsuccessfully sought evidence for CO+, and
   we obtained upper limits on HCO line strengths. In addition, we used
   laboratory data to make new identifications, by wavelength coincidence
   only, of lines of NH2. For the lines that remain unidentified, we have
   listed measured wavelengths and relative fluxes, in order to aid future
   efforts at identification. Our spectra include the green and one of the
   red lines of {[}O I], and the indicated photon flux ratio of lambda
   5577/(lambda 6300 + lambda 6364) is in the range 0.12-0.16, consistent
   with formation of the excited O atoms from photodissociation of H2O.},

   the different vibrational levels have been studied as functions of

   nonlinear effects of the plasma medium such as self focusing which
   exhibits threshold-like behaviour are also obtained. Temperature and
   electron density of the plasma have been evaluated using the relative

Pages = {6131-6137},
Abstract = {We propose that the generalization of pure spin single reference excited
   state theories from molecules with closed shell ground states to
   radicals be based on a redefinition of the meaning of excitation levels.
   Open shell single substitutions are expanded to include spin-adapted
   double excitations which traverse the singly occupied orbitals. These
   excitations are deleted from the expanded open shell double
   substitutions, which include the corresponding spin-adapted triple
   substitutions (e.g., a pair of the excitations traverses the singly
   occupied orbitals), etc. Applied to single excitation configuration
   interaction (CIS), this approach defines a spin-adapted extended CIS
   (XCIS) theory for the excited states of radicals. XCIS is size
   consistent and variational and has computational complexity that scales
   in the same way as CIS with molecular size. More low-lying excited
   states of radicals are correctly described by XCIS than by the
   restricted open shell CIS method. This is demonstrated by calculations
   on excited states of seven diatomic radicals and the methyl,
   nitromethyl, benzyl, phenoxyl, and anilino radicals.},

   Our equation of state includes 105 molecules and up to 27 ionization
   stages of 39 elements. In the calculations of the base grid of model
   atmospheres presented here, we include over 300 molecular bands of four
   molecules (TiO, VO, CaH, FeH) in the JOLA approximation, the water
   opacity of Ludwig (1971), collision-induced opacities, b-f and f-f
   atomic processes, as well as about 2 million spectral lines selected
   from a list with more than 42 million atomic and 24 million molecular
   (H-2, CH, NH, OH, MgH, SiH, C-2, CN, CO, SiO) lines. High-resolution

   model atmospheres and spectra are calculated with the generalized
   stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX, assuming LTE, plane-parallel geometry,
   energy (radiative plus convective) conservation, and hydrostatic
   equilibrium.
   The model spectra give close agreement with observations of M dwarfs
   across a wide spectral range from the blue to the near-IR, with one
   notable exception: the fit to the water bands. We discuss several
   practical applications of our model grid, e.g., broadband colors derived
   from the synthetic spectra. In light of current efforts to identify
   genuine brown dwarfs, we also show how low-resolution spectra of cool
   dwarfs vary with surface gravity, and how the high-resolution line
   profile of the Li I resonance doublet depends on the Li abundance.},

Journal = JCP,

Pages = {5999-6012},
Abstract = {The problem of rotational energy transfer (RET) is examined from a point
   of view intermediate between the current approaches based on empirical
   models or numerical solution of the coupled scattering equations. A
   semiclassical perspective is taken in which a classically described
   collision with an atom exerts a time dependent torque on the rotor and
   the resulting forced rotor dynamics is addressed quantum mechanically.
   By treating the anharmonicity in the rotational energy levels as a
   perturbation, a simple approximate expression is found for the inelastic
   transition probability. It reveals a marked difference between the
   distribution of final rotational states incurred from an individual
   collision trajectory as compared to trajectory averaged measures of RET,
   such as cross sections. The theory is applied to the scattering of
   Li-2(A (1) Sigma(u)(+)) by Ne, Ar, Xe;Na-2(A (1) Sigma(u)(+)) by He and
   Ne; N-2(+)(X (2) Sigma(g)(+)) by He, and CN(X (2) Sigma(+)) by He. Its
   predictions compare well with those from a fully quantum mechanical
   description of rigid rotor scattering and with experiment. The insight

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {1994},
Volume = {436},
Pages = {885-906},
Abstract = {We present a model to compute fluorescence spectra of the stable
   isotopes of CN in the comae of comets, The effects of collisions are
   included and shown to be significant as a mechanism secondary to the
   fluorescence process in the calculations. Our computed spectra are
   compared with high-resolution spectra of the B-2 Sigma(+)-X(2) Sigma(+)
   (0-0) band for comets Halley, Austin, and Levy. This comparison shows
   that collisional effects are observable in the CN spectra of relatively
   high production rate comets, such as Halley and Levy. Moreover, the
   model confirms that the overall structure of the CN spectra in comets
   results predominantly from pure fluorescence governed by the Swings
   effect. The primary goal of our model is to provide a methodology to
   compute accurate rotational line fluorescence efficiencies for the
   stable isotopes of CN: (CN)-C-12-N-14, (CN)-C-13-N-14, and
   (CN)-C-12-N-15. The fluorescence efficiencies are required to convert
   observed isotope line intensity ratios to isotope abundance ratios of
   carbon and nitrogen in comets.},

Title = {{The 1st detailed abundance analysis of galactic bulge-K Giants in baade
   window}},
Journal = ApJS,
Year = {1994},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {749-791},
Abstract = {We report analysis of echelle spectra (R = 17,000, S/N almost-equal-to
   50) of 12 Galactic bulge K giants in Baade's window from the sample of
   Rich ( 1988). We perform an abundance analysis for 11 stars ranging from
   {[}Fe/H] = -1 to {[}Fe/H] = 0.45. The accuracy of our abundance scale is
   confirmed relative to the disk super-metal-rich stars via the metal-rich
   giant mu Leonis, and to the Galactic globular clusters using a star in
   NGC 5927.
   We investigate the effects of CN blends on abundance analysis for stars
   more metal-rich than {[}Fe/H] = -0.3, through spectrum synthesis of the
   region from 6140 to 7600 angstrom, including in excess of 8000 (CN)-C-12
   and (CN)-C-13 lines. We confirm Peterson's assertion that blends of
   atomic lines with CN vibration-rotation lines can affect abundance
   results at R = 17,000; failure to reject affected Fe lines would have
   resulted in a spurious 0.3 dex increase in the derived Fe abundances of
   our most metal-rich stars.
   We find that one of the most metal-rich Baade's window stars (BW IV-167)
   has approximately the same metallicity as the super-metal-rich disk
   giant mu Leo. The abundance scale of Rich (1988), based on measurement
   of strong Fe and Mg lines, is almost-equal-to 0.3 dex high but may agree
   with our results if Rich's {[}M/H] actually measures {[}(Fe + Mg)/H].
   Using our abundances to transform Rich's {[}M/H] distribution, we find
   that the mean {[}Fe/H] is -0.25 for the bulge, slightly less than, but
   not appreciably different from, the mean {[}Fe/H] for solar neighborhood
   G and K giants. Surprisingly, this is not in conflict with the Galactic
   metallicity gradient found for the solar neighborhood. The extant data
   on {[}Fe/H] with Galactocentric radius are completely consistent with a
   zero gradient within the solar circle.
   Infrared flux temperatures for a sample of 34 Baade's window K giants
   observed by Frogel \& Whitford ( 1987) show that the bulge (J - K)
   versus T(eff) relation is identical to that of the solar neighborhood.
   We assert that the observed infrared colors reflect the actual effective
   temperatures, and that infrared colors affected by molecular blanketing
   cannot explain why the bulge giant branch is as blue as that of 47 Tuc.
   Verification of the (J - K) temperature scale, and use of our average
   {[}Fe/H] results, suggest that the Frogel \& Whitford ( 1987) infrared
   H-R diagram requires that the mean mass of Baade's window giants can be
   no less than about 1.1 M..
   Abundances for the alpha-elements are based on spectrum synthesis of
   lines due to Mg, Ti, Ca, and Si. We find a puzzling pattern in the
   trends of element abundance ratios with {[} Fe/ H 1. Mg and Ti are
   enhanced by almost-equal-to 0.3 dex relative to solar over almost the
   full {[}Fe/H] range. In contrast, Ca and Si closely follow the normal
   trends for disk giants, with solar ratios occurring above {[}Fe/H]
   almost-equal-to -0.2. The enrichment pattern of bulge giants sets them
   clearly apart from disk giants of the same {[}Fe/H]. For a subset of the
   sample we estimate {[}O/Fe] almost-equal-to O using the {[}O I] line at
   6300 angstrom; the absence of a carbon abundance indicator requires us
   to assume a solar C/Fe ratio. We speculate that the high Mg abundances
   seen in ellipticals (Worthey, Faber, \& Gonzalez 1992) may reflect a
   common enrichment process for bulges and ellipticals. We further propose
   that the high Ti abundances may largely account for the tendency for
   Baade's window M giants to have later spectral types than solar
   neighborhood M giants of the same infrared color (Frogel \& Whitford
   1987).
   Other noteworthy results include enhanced Al abundances similar to those
   seen in globular cluster giants, and (tentatively) enhancement of the
   r-process element Eu in the metal-rich bulge stars. The iron-peak and
   s-process elements appear normal relative to Fe. We find one
   super-Li-rich giant, BW I-194. We also identify BW I-155 as a
   spectroscopic double.
   This work also presents the following results of general use to
   investigators in the field: (1) In order to obtain a complete set of g f
   values for our Fe i lines, we find transformations between numerous log
   g f sources. In total we provide a list of 208 atomic g f values, for Fe
   I and numerous other species. (2) We present a list of uncontaminated
   continuum regions appropriate for use in metal-rich stars, as well as
   atomic lines clear from severe CN blending at a variety of
   metallicities.},

Abstract = {Tunable dye laser excitation of CN near 6000 angstrom in an atmospheric
   pressure CH4/N2O flame has resulted in the production of B 2SIGMA+-X
   2SIGMA+ system fluorescence, detected in the DELTAupsilon = 0 region
   (almost-equal-to 3860 angstrom). Analysis shows that four different
   mechanisms contribute to the spectrum in overlapping laser wavelength
   regions: (1) In the range from 5890-6016 angstrom, the spectrum is
   dominated by transitions in the B 2SIGMA+-A 2PI (0,0) band. This
   technique can be used with care as a quantitative CN A 2PI diagnostic in
   flames. (2) In the range 6016-6180 angstrom the excitation spectrum is
   positively identified as that of the A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (8, 3) and (9, 4)
   bands. However, fluorescence occurs from the B 2SIGMA+ state which can
   be populated only by collisional uptransfer. Part of the A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+
   (10, 5) band near 6300 angstrom has also been observed via the same
   mechanism; however, because A 2PI, upsilon = 10 is nearly iso-energetic
   with B 2SIGMA+, upsilon = 0 endoergic collisions are not necessary to
   promote the intersystem crossing. (3) In the range 6180-6298 angstrom,
   the spectrum consists mainly of lines produced by a collision-assisted
   single-color optical-optical double resonance (OODR). The first photon
   of the OODR is absorbed in the A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (4, 0) band, the second
   in the B 2SIGMA+-A 2PI (3, 4) band. The density of lines in the region
   is possible only if collisional rotational relaxation occurs in the
   intermediate A 2PI, upsilon = 4 level during the laser pulse. (4) In the
   same wavelength region (6180-6298 angstrom) a second, independent
   process occurs: near-resonant two-photon excitation (NR2PE) in the B

Volume = {97},
Pages = {10911-10919},
Abstract = {The correlated angular distribution of translational and rotational
   motion of photofragments is probed by Doppler-broadened transient
   absorption line shapes. The one-photon nature of the probe process
   reduces the complexity of the analysis, while maintaining sensitivity to
   five bipolar moments of the translational and rotational angular
   distributions. The 193-nm photodissociation of C2H5SCN illustrates the
   method, with CN products detected with a titanium:sapphire ring laser
   probing the A2PI-X2SIGMA+ transition. The vector correlations in the
   high rotational states of CN indicate a direct dissociation following a
   transition of mixed symmetry at 193 nm: the recoil is preferentially but
   not exclusively parallel to a transition moment, and the perpendicular
   component is dominated by a rotation axis parallel to a C2H5SCN
   transition moment. The strong rotational excitation is generated by
   planar bending forces in a bent excited state. Lower rotational states
   are formed with a composite kinetic energy distribution, indicating an
   additional, slower, less highly polarized channel that partitions more
   energy into the unobserved C2H5S radical than does the direct channel.
   At 248 nm, a weaker absorption also generates CN photofragments with a
   preferentially parallel recoil, requiring a reassessment of the
   excited-state assignments in the alkyl thiocyanates.},

   bimodal: one dominated in v' = 0-3 and the other in v' = 11-19. In the
   latter channel, more than 90\% of the available energy is transmitted to
   the vibrational motion of the product, CN(B,v' = 11-19). On the other
   hand, only CN(B) in the low vibrational states (v' = 0-3) was produced
   from NaCN. The bimodal vibrational distribution of CN(B) from KCN
   implies that CN(B,v' = 0-3) and CN(B,v' = 11-19) were produced through
   different reaction channels; the former was produced in the direct
   dissociation on a repulsive potential energy surface and the latter in
   the predissociation through an excited ion-pair state with a long
   equilibrium internuclear distance between C and N. The direct
   dissociation was explained by use of classical dynamics simulations. It

Abstract = {Time-histories of the CN radical were monitored using a tunable ring dye
   laser to measure absorption at the P-branch bandhead of the B2SIGMA+ <--
   X2SIGMA+ (0, 0) band of CN in a shock tube. Measurements of CN resulting
   from the pyrolysis of highly dilute mixtures of C2N2 in Ar were compared

   the bandhead was determined to be 25743.72 cm-1 (lambda = 388.444 nm). A
   second set of experiments at the maximum absorption frequency was
   conducted for temperatures between 2700 and 4900 K and pressures between
   0.34 and 1.0 atm. These measurements were used to determine an
   expression for the effective collisional broadening coefficient.
   Correlation of the data with the spectroscopic model led to a

   this expression is +/- 15\% for T < 3000 K and +/- 5\% for T > 3300 K.
   The detection limit of the CN diagnostic is 0.1\% absorption, which
   corresponds to a CN detection sensitivity of 0.02 ppm at T = 3600 K, P =
   1 atm, and a path length of 14.3 cm.},

Pages = {1987-2034},
Abstract = {We report on spectroscopic observations for 1044 stars, located
   primarily in the southern Galactic hemisphere, chosen from a list of
   candidate metal-deficient stars discovered in the HK objective-prism
   survey. Metal abundances for the program stars, on the {[}Fe/H] scale,
   are obtained from a previously published calibration of the variation in
   the equivalent width of the Ca II K absorption line (lambda-3933
   angstrom) as a function of broadband (B-V)0 color. Broadband UBV
   photometry is available for roughly one-third of the present sample. For
   the majority of stars without available photometry (primarily stars with
   an inferred {[}Fe/H] > -2.0), we obtain estimated dereddened (B-V)0
   colors from an empirical calibration of the variation of Balmer line
   equivalent width with broadband color. Radial velocities, with
   accuracies on the order of 10 km s-1, are obtained for all our program
   stars. Distance estimates, accurate to 10\%-15\%, are reported for the
   subsample of program stars with available photometry. Less accurate
   distances are obtained for the remaining stars by a calibration of
   apparent magnitude with crude brightness estimates from the original
   survey plates. The sample reported here includes 734 stars with {[}Fe/H]
   less-than-or-equal-to -1.0, 446 stars with {[}Fe/H]
   less-than-or-equal-to -2.0, 70 stars with {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to
   -3.0, and at least three stars with {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -4.0.
   Due to uncertainties in the calibration of our metal-abundance
   determinations for late-type stars, the actual number of stars with
   {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -4.0 in the present sample may be on the
   order of 5-10. Fifty stars in our sample exhibit anomalously strong G
   bands, characteristic of the subgiant CH stars discussed by Bond. Among
   the most metal-deficient objects (as inferred from their Ca II K
   equivalent widths), we identify six stars with moderate to strong CN
   bands. The present program stars form the basis for addressing a wide
   range of questions concerning the formation and evolution of the
   Galactic halo population, and, by inference, the nature of the first
   generations of star formation in the universe. The number of extremely
   metal-poor stars ({[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -2.0) reported in the
   present sample is roughly quadruple the sample size of nonkinematically
   selected stars of similar metal abundance reported by previous workers,
   and is on the order of the total previous samples of stars in this
   abundance regime when all sources are included. The number of stars with
   {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -3.0 in the present sample is seven times
   the number of previously identified stars with spectroscopically
   determined abundances which are this low. We emphasize, however, that
   the present sample only represents on the order of 10\% of the number of
   such extreme objects that remain to be discovered upon completion of the
   follow-up spectroscopy and photometry of metal-deficient candidates
   identified in our ongoing objective-prism survey.},

Pages = {1063-1068},
Abstract = {Direct, spatially resolved, spectroscopic measurements of C2 in
   side-heated (spatially isothermal) and Massmann-type (spatially
   non-isothermal) atomizers showed that the partial pressure of gaseous
   carbon (pC2) is in thermodynamic, heterogeneous equilibrium for
   temperatures above 2970 K. No evidence for over-equilibrium excesses of
   C2 was obtained. The pCN exhibits a gradient, decreasing from the bottom
   to the top of the graphite tube, indicating the importance of air
   ingress through the injection hole. Further, the pCN is reduced by the
   presence of aqueous solutions, primarily close to the point of sample
   deposition, revealing the non-equilibrium distribution of CN in the
   atomizer, whereas C2 is only marginally affected. Spatially resolved
   measurements of Al also indicate the importance of O2 ingress and the
   sheath gas flow rate on the Al atomic absorption signals, indicating
   that the pO2 largely determines the degree of Al atom formation and not
   the presence of gaseous, carbon-containing species.},

   based on diagonalising the Hamiltonian of the B2-SIGMA+ and A 2-PI(i)

Abstract = {In molecular clouds of modest density and relatively high fractional

   assembled and used to determine electron densities.  The derived values,

   the range 10(2.5) - 10(3.5) cm-3, which generally agree well with

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1991},

Pages = {5353-5359},
Abstract = {The dependence of the electronic transition moment R(e)(R) for the
   B2-SIGMA+-X2-SIGMA+ transition of CN on the internuclear distance R is
   determined by an analysis of the relative intensity of its emission
   spectrum.  In the present analysis of the spectrum, the relative values
   of R(e)(R) are directly evaluated by use of the vibrational integrals,
   <upsilon'\textbackslash{}R(n)\textbackslash{}upsilon{''}> (n = 1,2,...),
   instead of the r-centroid approximation, which is found to be inadequate
   particularly in the tail bands (upsilon' greater-than-or-equal-to 10).
   The validity of the r-centroid approximation is discussed on the basis
   of the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potentials of the B2-SIGMA+ and
   X2-SIGMA+ states.  The R dependence of the R(e)(R) value is interpreted
   in terms of the electronic wave function of B2-SIGMA+; the
   configuration-interaction (CI) coefficients for the electronic
   configurations of the B2-SIGMA+ state are estimated.  The CI
   coefficients obtained in the present study, as well as those for the
   A2-PI-i state derived previously from a similar analysis of the

   evaluate the electronic part of the spin-orbit matrix element between

   predicted to be -25 and -21 cm-1 at R = 0.97 and 1.3 angstrom,

Title = {{Electronic spectroscopy of the cyanogen halides}},
Journal = JPC,
Year = {1991},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {639-656},
Abstract = {The electronic absorption spectra of the cyanogen halides, XCN where X =
   Cl, Br, and I, have been investigated in the range 3100-1050 angstrom.
   The spectra are analyzed in terms of vibronic structure, oscillator
   strengths, and effective quantum numbers.  The spectra of the cyanogen
   halides exhibit no regular Rydberg structure.  The absence of regularity
   is shown to be a direct consequence of the presence of intravalence
   excitations and Rydberg/valence interactions.  In confirmation of the
   above, the intravalence transitions arising from the 2-pi-->(5-delta,
   3-pi, and 6-delta) configurational excitations are observed and
   assigned.  In addition, we presume to extract ``term values{''} for the
   antibonding 5-delta, 3-pi, and 6-delta MOs and then use these to predict
   the energies of the remaining nine low-energy intravalence excitations
   of the cyanogen halides, \{4-delta; 1-pi; 3-delta\}-->\{5-delta; 3-pi;
   6-delta\}.  There is a danger in this, in that we seem, too blithely
   perhaps, to make use of a simple one-electron MO model in situations
   where it is known that many-electron effects may dominate.  We believe
   that the use of one-electron considerations is moderated by the
   extensive use of a vast amount of empirical, correlative experimental
   data.  Finally, all excited states that arise from the 12 low-energy
   intravalence excitations are correlated with the states of the separated
   halogen atom and CN radical such that photoprocesses in the cyanogen
   halides may be rationalized.  The A-band and alpha-band continua are
   assigned as 2-pi-->5-delta, 1,3II and 2-pi-->3-pi; 1,3-DELTA,
   1,3-SIGMA+,1,3-SIGMA- configurational excitations, respectively.  The
   4-delta-->5-delta;1-SIGMA+ transition is associated with the discrete
   structure atop the alpha continuum; the intense, discrete band systems
   that lie to the blue of the B and C Rydberg band systems are associated
   with the 2-pi-->6-delta;1,3II intravalence transitions.  The states that
   arise from the remaining eight configurational excitations are shown to
   be mostly dissociative in nature.  The correlation scheme predicts (i)
   CN (X2-SIGMA+) to be the primary product of photolysis within the A
   continua; (ii) CN (A2II(i)) to be the primary product of photolysis from
   the onset of the alpha continua up to photon energies of 80 000 cm-1 for
   each of the cyanogen halides, and (iii) CN (B2-SIGMA+) to be a primary
   product for photon energies greater than approximately 105 000, 94 000,
   and 80 000 cm-1 in CICN, BrCN, and ICN, respectively.},
