Abstract = {{Line strengths have been calculated in the form of Einstein A
   coefficients and f-values for a large number of bands of the A(2)Pi-X-2
   Sigma(+) and B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+) systems and rovibrational
   transitions within the X-2 Sigma(+) state of CN using Western's pgopher
   program. The J dependence of the transition dipole moment matrix
   elements (the Herman-Wallis effect) has been taken into account.
   Rydberg-Klein-Rees potential energy functions for the A(2)Pi, B-2
   Sigma(+), and X-2 Sigma(+) states were computed using spectroscopic
   constants from the A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) and B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+)
   transitions. New electronic transition dipole moment functions for these
   systems and a dipole moment function for the X-2 Sigma(+) state were
   generated from high level ab initio calculations and have been used in
   Le Roy's level program to produce transition dipole moment matrix
   elements (including their J dependence) for a large number of
   vibrational bands. The program pgopher was used to calculate Einstein A
   coefficients, and a line list was generated containing the observed and
   calculated wavenumbers, Einstein A coefficients and f-values for 290
   bands of the A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) transition with v' = 0-22, v `' = 0-15,
   250 bands of the B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+) transition with v' = 0-15, v
   `' = 0-15 and 120 bands of the rovibrational transitions within the X-2
   Sigma(+) state with v = 0-15. The Einstein A coefficients have been used
   to compute radiative lifetimes of several vibrational levels of the
   A(2)Pi and B-2 Sigma(+) states and the values compared with those
   available from previous experimental and theoretical studies.}},

Title = {STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF MOLECULAR CLOUDS WITH CN ZEEMAN DETECTIONS
   I: W3(OH)},
Journal = APJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {733},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {We have carried out a multi-species study of a region which has had
   previous measurements of strong magnetic fields through the CN Zeeman
   effect in order to explore the relationship between CN and N(2)H(+),
   both of which have evidence that they remain in the gas phase at
   densities of 10(5)-10(6) cm(-3). To achieve this, we map the 1 arcmin(2)
   region around the UCHII region of W3(OH) using the Combined Array for
   Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). Approximately 105 hr of data were
   collected in multiple array configurations to produce maps with an
   effective resolution of similar to 2 `'.5 at high signal-to-noise ratios
   (S/Ns) in CN, C(18)O, HCN, HCO(+), N(2)H(+), and two continuum bands
   (91.2 GHz and 112 GHz). These data allow us to compare tracer molecules
   associated with both low-and high-density regions to infer gas
   properties. We determine that CARMA resolves out approximately 35\% of
   the CN emission around W3(OH) when compared with spectra obtained from
   the IRAM 30 m telescope. The presence of strong absorption lines toward
   the continuum source in three of the molecular transitions infers the
   presence of a cold, dark, optically thick region in front of the
   continuum source. In addition, the presence of high-velocity emission
   lines near the continuum source shows the presence of hot clumpy
   emission behind the continuum source. These data determine that future
   high-resolution interferometric CN Zeeman measurements which cannot
   currently be performed (due to technical limitations of current
   telescopes) are feasible. We confirm that CN is indeed a good tracer for
   high-density regions; with certain objects such as W3(OH) it appears to
   be a more accurate tracer than N(2)H(+).},

Title = {Low-resolution spectroscopy of main sequence stars belonging to 12
   Galactic globular clusters I. CH and CN band strength variations},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {524},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context. Globular clusters show star-to-star abundance variations for
   light elements that are not yet well understood. The preferred
   explanation involves a self-enrichment scenario, within which two
   subsequent generations of stars co-exist in globular clusters.
   Observations of chemical abundances in the main sequence and sub-giant
   branch stars allow us to investigate the signature of this chemically
   processed material without the complicating effects caused by stellar
   evolution and internal mixing.
   Aims. Our main goal is to investigate the carbon-nitrogen
   anti-correlation with low-resolution spectroscopy of 20-50 stars fainter
   than the first dredge-up in seven Galactic globular clusters (NGC 288,
   NGC 1851, NGC 5927, NGC 6352, NGC 6388, and Pal 12) with different
   properties. We complemented our observations with 47 Tuc archival data,
   with four additional clusters from the literature (M 15, M 22, M 55, NGC
   362), and with additional literature data on NGC 288.
   Methods. In this first paper, we measured the strengh of the CN and CH
   band indices, which correlate with the N and C abundances, and we
   investigated the anti-correlation and bimodality of these indices. We
   compared r(CN), the ratio of stars belonging to the CN-strong and weak
   groups, with 15 different cluster parameters.
   Results. We clearly see bimodal anti-correlation of the CH and CN band
   stregths in the metal-rich clusters (Pal 12, 47 Tuc, NGC 6352, NGC
   5927). Only M 15 among the metal-poor clusters shows a clearly bimodal
   anti-correlation. We found weak correlations (sligthly above 1 sigma) of
   rCN with the cluster orbital parameters, present-day total mass, cluster
   concentration, and age.
   Conclusions. Our findings support the self-enrichment scenario, and
   suggest that the occurrence of more than two major generations of stars
   in a GGC should be rare. Small additional generations (< 10-20\% of the
   total) would be difficult to detect with our samples. The first
   generation, which corresponds to the CN-weak stars, usually contains
   more stars than the second one (< rCN > = 0.82 +/- 0.29), as opposed to
   results based on the Na-O anti-correlations.},

Title = {High resolution observation of 17P/Holmes during the outburst event in
   2007},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {522},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Aims. On October 24, 2007 the comet 17P/Holmes underwent an outburst
   that was extraordinary in both duration and size. We attempted to
   determine the cause of the outburst by acquiring and analyzing high
   resolution spectra of the comet.
   Methods. On two nights, October 25 and December 2, we acquired four high
   resolution spectra in the visible range at the Telescopio Nazionale
   Galileo in La Palma. The oxygen lines intensity ratio was estimated for
   the observation performed on October 25, and computed for the
   observation performed on December 2.
   Results. Many emission lines were detected in the spectra, most of them
   attributable to C(2), NH(2), CN and CH. The atomic O green line and one
   of the red doublet lines were detected in a spectrum acquired on October
   25. All the three atomic O lines were detected in a spectrum acquired on
   December 2. The value obtained for the first night, 0.1 +/- 0.11,
   implies that the H(2)O molecule was the main parent of the emission
   lines, while the value obtained for the second night, 0.3 +/- 0.1,
   implies that the main parent was CO or CO(2) instead than H(2)O.
   Conclusions. Our results imply that in the days around the outburst the
   water production was exceptionally high for that heliocentric distance.
   By December, however, the behavior of 17P/Holmes had returned to that of
   a comet orbiting at 2.6 AU from the Sun, in which state the activity is
   probably sustained mostly by gases more volatile than water, such as CO
   and CO(2).},

Abstract = {We have carried out calculations of the fluorescent equilibrium of the

   yield reasonable agreement and remaining discrepancies are well
   understood. Based on the derived equilibrium rotational level
   populations of the ground state, 1-1 band rotational line intensities
   were also calculated. Total band fluorescence efficiencies for the
   violet Delta v = 0 sequence are tabulated for the above range of
   distances and velocities, permitting the interpolation to any given
   comet's observational circumstances. These fluorescence efficiencies,
   L/N, or ``g-factors,{''} needed to reduce CN emission band fluxes to CN
   abundances, are also accessible via a Web-based service. The values at

   changes dramatically with distance.},

Abstract = {Rotational excitation of the CN(X (2)Sigma(+)) molecule with He is

   (PES) for the He-CN system, calculated at an internuclear CN distance
   frozen at its experimental equilibrium distance. This PES was obtained
   using an open-shell, coupled-cluster method including all single and
   double excitations, as well as the perturbative contributions of
   connected triple excitations {[}RCCSD(T)]. Bond functions were placed at
   mid-distance between the center of mass of the CN molecule and He atom
   for a better description of the van der Waals interaction.
   State-to-state collisional excitation cross sections of the
   fine-structure levels of CN by He are calculated for energies up to 2500
   cm(-1), which yield after thermal averaging, rate coefficients up to 350
   K. The exact spin splitting of the energy levels is taken into account.
   The propensity rules between fine-structure levels are studied, and it
   is shown that the rate constants for Delta j=Delta N transitions are
   much larger than those for Delta j not equal Delta N transitions, as
   expected from theoretical considerations. Our calculated rate

   molecular beam-laser apparatus. These supersonic beams have been used to
   study the reactive scattering of C(2) and CN radicals with unsaturated
   hydrocarbons. This paper reports here on the C(2) and CN radical beam

   CN+C(2)H(2) (acetylene) and CN+CH(3)CCH (methylacetylene) by the crossed
   molecular beam scattering technique with universal mass spectrometric

   excitation on the dynamics of the CN+C(2)H(2) reaction is discussed with
   reference to previous dynamics and kinetics studies. These reactions are
   of interest in the chemistry of planetary atmospheres (Titan) and the
   interstellar medium as well as in combustion.},

Abstract = {Rate constants for collisional loss and transfer of population and
   rotational angular momentum alignment have been determined for the
   CN(A(2)Pi, nu = 4) + Ar system. Aligned samples of CN(A(2)Pi , nu = 4,
   F(1), j = 1.5-23.5e) were prepared by optical pumping on the A-X(4,0)
   band. Their evolution was observed using Doppler-resolved
   frequency-modulated spectroscopy in stimulated emission on the A-X(4,2)
   band. State-resolved total population removal rate constants, and
   state-to-state rotational energy transfer (RET) rate constants, are
   found to be in excellent agreement with previous experimental
   measurements and theoretical predictions for the nu = 3 level. Rapid
   elastic depolarization of rotational alignment was observed for j =
   1.5-6.5, with an average rate constant of 1.1 x 10(-10) cm(3) s(-1).
   This declines with increasing j, reaching zero within experimental error
   for j = 23.5. The polarization transfer efficiency of the initially
   created alignment in state-to-state RET was also determined for the
   selected initial state j = 6.5, F(1), e. Substantial depolarization of
   the alignment was observed for small Dj transitions. Alignment transfer
   efficiencies ranged from 0.55 +/- 0.06 for Delta j = -1, to 0.32 +/-
   0.08 for Delta j = +3. These measurements are discussed with reference
   to recent experimental and theoretical advances on collisional
   depolarization of related open-shell species. We suggest that the
   surprisingly efficient collisional depolarization observed may be the
   result of the multiple potential energy surfaces involved in this
   system.},

Journal = JMS,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {258},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {6-12},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Based on high-level ab initio calculations, we predict the existence of
   a strong (4)Sigma(+)-(4)Sigma(+) optical transition (d(av) = 1.6 D) near
   328 nm (T(00) = 30460 cm(-1)), analogous to the
   B(2)Sigma(+)-X(2)Sigma(+) violet system, (d(av) = 1.7 D) in the
   near-ultraviolet spectrum of CN. The lower state of the predicted
   transition is the lowest-lying state of quartet multiplicity and has
   been observed previously through its perturbations of the B state. The
   predicted transition will enable determination of the equilibrium
   properties of the metastable lowest quartet state of CN. The lowest
   energy metastable sextet state of CN is also calculated to be
   quasi-bound (r(e) = 1.76 angstrom,omega(e) = 365 cm(-1)), and a
   (6)Sigma(+)-(6)Sigma(+) transition, analogous to those for the doublet
   and quartet multiplicities, is predicted (d(av) = 2.2 D). Investigation
   of the isoelectronic BO, C(2)(-), and N(2)(+) molecules reveals that
   differences in 2s(2)2p(x) and 2s(1)2p(x+1) atomic energies play the key
   role in determining the magnitude of the 5 sigma(2p) <- 4
   sigma(2s)-derived Sigma(+)-Sigma(+) transition energies for the
   different multiplicities. Furthermore, the strong stabilization of
   2s(2)2p(x) character with respect to 2s(1)2p(x+1) in BO and N(2)(+)
   leads to strongly bound lowest (6)Sigma(+) states with binding energies
   as high as 2.0 eV. We believe that these newly predicted sextet states
   could be identified through their perturbations of quartet states of the
   relevant molecules. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   constant (average values of, respectively, 91.0 +/- 3.6 and 147.8 +/-

   or heliocentric distance. While the carbon isotopic ratio does agree
   with the terrestrial value (89), the nitrogen ratio is a factor of two
   lower than the terrestrial value (272), indicating a fractionation in
   the early solar system, or in the protosolar nebula, common to all the
   comets of our sample. This points towards a common origin of the comets
   independently of their birthplaces, and a relationship between HCN and

Abstract = {Optical-optical double resonance was employed to study rotational energy

   CN A-X (3,0) band, while the initially excited and collisionally
   populated levels were observed after a short delay by laser-induced
   fluorescence in the B-A (3,3) band. Total removal rate constants for
   specified rotational/fine-structure levels involving total angular

   However, the computed state-to-state rate constants show a stronger
   propensity for fine-structure and A-doublet changing transitions. These
   differences between experiment and theory could be due to the neglect of
   the N(2) orientation and the correlation of the CN and N(2) angular

Abstract = {Measurements of multiple rotational lines in the (1,0) band of the
   A(2)Pi(i) - X(2)Sigma(+) ``red{''} system of the cyanogen radical (CN)
   at sub-Doppler resolution are reported. The CN radical was produced by
   193 nm photodissociation of NCCN (ethane dinitrile) and detected with a
   Ti:sapphire ring laser operating near 10 900 cm(-1). The sample was
   exposed to a weak, frequency-modulated probe beam and a strong,
   counter-propagating bleach laser beam. Demodulated probe laser signals
   display absorption and dispersion features derived from Doppler-free
   saturation of the hyperfine components as the laser scans across the
   central region of a Doppler-broadened rotational line spectrum.
   Hyperfine-resolved transition frequencies were combined with known
   ground-state X(2)Sigma hyperfine term values to determine A(2)Pi state
   hyperfine term values, which were analyzed in terms of an effective
   Hamiltonian for the A(2)Pi state. All the expected hyperfine and (14)N
   quadrupolar parameters were determined and their values analyzed in
   terms of a simple molecular orbital picture of the bonding in the
   radical. Higher sensitivity obtained with 400 kHz amplitude modulation
   of the bleach laser and additional phase-sensitive detection allowed
   hyperfine splittings in some rotational lines of (13)C(14)N to be
   observed in natural abundance. Excited state hyperfine splittings were
   determined for a selection of rotational states, but not enough to
   determine the (13)C hyperfine parameters. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All

   the contamination of H2O molecules into the reaction region was reduced
   to approximate to 30\%, being confirmed by monitoring the reduction of
   the OH(A(2)Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi) emission intensity. The variation of the
   CN(B-2 Sigma(+)-X-2 Sigma(+)) emission intensity on the pressure of Ar,
   P-Ar, of 0.1-0.3 Torr was compared with that of the density of electrons
   whose kinetic energy was lower than the ionization energy of BrCN, 11.9

Abstract = {The rotational spectrum of the molecular negative ion CN(-) has been
   detected in the laboratory at high resolution. The four lowest
   transitions were observed in a low pressure glow discharge through
   C(2)N(2) and N(2). Conclusive evidence for the identification was
   provided by well-resolved nitrogen quadrupole hyperfine structure in the
   lowest rotational transition, and a measurable Doppler shift owing to
   ion drift in the positive column of the discharge. Three spectroscopic
   constants (B, D, and eQq) reproduce the observed spectrum to within one
   part in 10(7) or better, allowing the entire rotational spectrum to be
   calculated well into the far IR to within 1 km s(-1) in equivalent
   radial velocity. CN(-) is an excellent candidate for astronomical

Abstract = {CN(X-2 Sigma(+)) radicals were produced by the decomposition of BrCN
   with the microwave discharge flow of Ar under the conditions of Ar
   pressure in the range of 0.40-0.70 Torr. The laser-induced fluorescence
   (LIF) spectra of the CN(A(2)Pi X-i(2)Sigma(+)), 4-0, 5-1, and 7-2 bands
   were observed, and their intensities were calibrated against
   Rayleigh-scattering intensity by Ar atoms, from which the CN(X-2
   Sigma(+)) radical density (n(CN(X))) was determined as (0.67 +/- 0.25) x
   10(18) to (4.42 +/- 0.83) x 10(18) m(-3). Hydrogenated amorphous carbon
   nitride (a-CNx:H) films were formed by depositing the CN(X-2 Sigma(+))
   radicals on Si substrates in the same reaction system as LIF. The
   sticking probability (s) of the CN(X-2 Sigma(+)) radicals onto the
   a-CNx:H films was determined by using n(CN(X)), the flow speed, and the
   weight (w) of a-CNx:H. The s value was determined as (6.4 +/- 6.4) x
   10(-2) to (2.5 +/- 1.2) x 10(-2), where the errors are predominantly
   determined by those in n(CN(X)) and w. The procedure described in the
   present study will provide a methodology to determine the sticking
   probability of the precursor radicals of the film formation based on the
   gas-phase LIF spectroscopy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   state-to-state rotational energy transfer (k(i -> f)) between levels N-i
   and other rotational levels N-f in collisions with C2H2. CN radicals
   were generated by pulsed laser photolysis of NCNO at 573 nm. A fraction
   of the radicals was then promoted to a selected rotational level in v=2
   using a tunable infrared ``pump{''} laser operating at similar to 2.45
   mu m, and the subsequent fate of this subset of radicals was monitored
   using pulsed laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). Values of k(tot,Ni) were
   determined by observing the decay of the PLIF signals as the delay
   between pump and probe laser pulses was systematically varied. In a
   second series of experiments, double resonance spectra were recorded at
   a short delay between the pump and probe laser pulses. Analysis of these
   spectra yielded state-to-state rate coefficients for rotational energy
   transfer, k(i -> f). The difference between the sum of these rate
   coefficients, Sigma(f)k(i -> f), and the value of k(tot,Ni) for the same
   level N-i is attributed to the occurrence of chemical reaction, yielding
   values of the rotationally selected rate coefficients (k(reac,Ni)) for
   reaction of CN from specified rotational levels. These rate coefficients

Abstract = {We present the first results from a novel experimental approach to the
   measurement of state-to-state differential scattering cross-sections for
   inelastic scattering of electronically excited CN A(2)Pi with Ar.
   Photodissociation of ICN with linearly polarized 266 nm radiation
   generates CN X-2 Sigma(+) (upsilon(')=0,J(')) with a near mono-energetic
   speed distribution and large anisotropy. Saturated optical pumping of
   the nascent CN X-2 Sigma(+) transfers this speed distribution without
   distortion to selected rotational quantum states of the A(2)Pi
   (upsilon(')=4) level. The products of rotational energy transfer within
   the A(2)Pi (upsilon(')=4) level into the J(')=0.5, F-2, f, state are
   probed using frequency modulated stimulated emission spectroscopy on the
   A-X (4,2) band with a single frequency external cavity tunable diode
   laser. Doppler profiles of transitions from individual rotational,
   spin-orbit and lambda doublet specific levels are acquired for different
   geometrical arrangements of photolysis polarization and probe
   propagation directions. The resulting Doppler profiles, which for this
   J(')=0.5 state cannot display a rotational angular momentum alignment,
   are combined to yield composite Doppler profiles depending on speed and
   translational anisotropy, which are analyzed to determine fully
   state-to-state resolved differential scattering cross-sections. (c) 2007

Abstract = {The effect of bulk water on the B (2)Sigma(+) <- X (2)Sigma(+) and A
   (2)Pi <- X (2)Sigma(+) electronic transitions of the cyano radical is
   investigated. First, the cyano radical-water dimer is characterized to
   understand the nature of the interactions and parametrize molecular
   mechanics (MM) potentials. The carbon atom, which hosts the unpaired
   electron, is found to have a Lennard-Jones radius smaller than typical
   force fields values. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) is then used to
   sample water configurations around the radical, employing two sets of MM
   parameters for the cyano radical and water. Subsequently, vertical
   excitation energies are calculated using time-dependent density
   functional theory (TD-DFT) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with
   single and double substitutions (EOM-CCSD). The effect of water is
   modeled by point charges used in the MD simulations. It is found that
   both bands blue-shift with respect to their gas phase position; the
   magnitude of the shift is only weakly dependent on the method and the MM
   parameter set used. The calculated shifts are analyzed in terms of the
   solute-solvent interactions in the ground and excited states.
   Significant contributions come from valence repulsion and
   electrostatics. Consequences for experiments on ICN photodissociation in
   water are discussed.},

Abstract = {We report rate coefficients (k(tot,Ni)) for total removal of
   CN(X-2+Sigma(+), v = 2, N-i) radicals from selected rotational levels
   (N-i = 0, 1, 6, 10, 15 and 20) and for state-to-state rotational energy
   transfer (k(i -> f)) between levels N-i and other rotational levels N-f
   in single collisions with N-2. CN radicals have been generated using two
   sources: (a) the pulsed laser photolysis of ICN at 266 nm, which
   generates translationally `hot' CN radicals; and (b) the pulsed laser
   photolysis of NCNO at 570 nm, which generates CN radicals with
   translational energies close to the average value at 298 K. Comparison
   of the values of k(tot),(Ni) obtained using these two sources of CN
   demonstrates: firstly, that the same results are obtained as long as
   time is allowed for the translationally hot CN radicals generated from
   ICN to be thermalised before radicals are promoted to a specific
   rotational level in v = 2 using a tuneable infrared `pump' laser
   operating at ca. 2.45 mu m; and secondly, that the rate coefficients
   decrease, but the averaged cross-sections remain approximately constant,
   as the excess translational energy in CN radicals is moderated by
   collisions. With NCNO as the source of CN radicals, the observed values
   of k(tot),(Ni) do not depend on the delay between the pulses from the
   photolysis and pump lasers. Finally, we demonstrate that, for the
   non-reactive collision partner N-2 and with allowances made for the rate
   coefficients that are too small to measure directly, the sum of the
   state-to-state rate coefficients, Sigma(f) k(i -> f), for rotational
   energy transfer from a selected initial level N-i agrees quite well with
   the value of k(tot),(Ni) for total transfer from the same initial level.
   The values of k(tot),(Ni) and of the state-to-state rate coefficients
   are compared with similar, earlier, results in which helium and argon
   were the collision partners. The relevance of these results to the study
   of collisions of CN with reactive collision partners is briefly

   Surrounding these well-known OH lines, we have discovered the presence

   profiles. Although the Stokes V signals of the OH lines are
   antisymmetric and of a sizable amplitude, the CN lines show almost
   negligible circular polarization. On the contrary, the linear

   in the OH lines. Interestingly, these CN lines present striking
   antisymmetric linear polarization profiles, which we are able to explain
   and model via the Paschen-Back effect theory for diatomic molecules. The
   presence of such peculiar CN lines in the same spectral region of the OH

   line profiles of the various species can be classified into three
   groups: narrow, broad, or double-peaked. The emission apparently
   originates in an unusual, compact H II region and in associated neutral
   gas, both concentrated primarily within the small, dusty torus that
   optically obscures the central star. The detection of the Ba II emission

Abstract = {A source of possible error, not previously considered, in the

   T<INF>g</INF><SUP>(CN) from interstellar CN absorption is proposed. This
   concerns the intrinsic assumption of the validity of using Honl-London
   rotational line intensity factors to determine the rotational components
   of the oscillator strengths of the R(0), R(1), and P(1) lines of the CN
   B2S+-X2S+ (0,0) transition. Published data on interstellar CN absorption
   shows that T</SUP><INF>g</INF><SUP>(CN) is slightly greater than the
   standard cosmological CBR temperature, T</SUP><INF>g</INF>(COBE) = 2.725
   K, determined by the COBE satellite, even when local excitation effects
   of CN are taken into account. From this difference, an estimation was
   made of the maximum corrections, a few percent, to the ratio of the line
   strengths and to the ratio of the Honl-London factors. Fluorescence
   lifetime data were shown to give similar values for the corrections as
   well as providing evidence for intramolecular coupling between the
   relevant B2S+ state rotational levels and close-lying levels of the A2P
   state, this being responsible for rendering the standard Honl-London

Abstract = {Recent advances in the computation of the Zeeman splitting of molecular
   lines have paved the way for their use as diagnostics of solar and
   stellar magnetic fields. A systematic study of their diagnostic
   capabilities had not been carried out so far, however. Here we
   investigate how molecular lines can be used to deduce the magnetic and
   thermal structure of sunspots, starspots and cool stars. First, we
   briefly describe the Stokes radiative transfer of Zeeman-split molecular
   lines. Then, we compute Stokes spectra of TiO, OH, CH and FeH lines and
   investigate their diagnostic capabilities. We also compare the synthetic
   profiles with observations. Spectra of TiO, OH and FeH are found to be
   interesting diagnostics of sunspot magnetic fields. This is also true
   for cool stars, where, however, the OH Stokes V profiles may require
   very high S/N data to be reliably employed. Finally we investigate the
   potential of various molecular bands for high-contrast imaging of the
   solar surface. The violet CN and CH bands turn out to be most promising
   for imaging the photosphere, the TiO bands are excellent for imaging
   sunspot umbrae, while the UV OH band can be used for imaging both the
   photosphere and sunspots.},

Abstract = {{Context. The second solar spectrum resulting from coherent scattering is
   a main tool for diagnostics of turbulent magnetic fields on the Sun.
   Scattering on diatomic molecules plays an important role in forming this
   spectrum and even dominates in some spectral regions.
   Aims. In a magnetic field electronic states of a molecule are often
   perturbed via the Paschen-Back effect. Sometimes this perturbation can
   completely change the spectrum, not only quantitatively, but even
   qualitatively. Here we calculate molecular scattering properties taking
   into account the Paschen-Back effect.
   Methods. Starting with the Hund's case (a) wave functions as a basis we
   obtain with the perturbation theory wave functions of the intermediate
   Hund's case (a-b) in a magnetic field. Using new, perturbed values of
   the Lande factors and transition amplitudes we calculate the Mueller
   matrix for coherent scattering at diatomic molecules in the intermediate
   Hund's case (a-b) and look for the effects that can be caused by the
   Paschen-Back effect.
   Results. We have found a considerable deviation from the Zeeman regime
   and discuss here the quantitative and qualitative effects on observed
   polarization signals for the CN B-2 Sigma-X-2 Sigma and MgH
   B'(2)Sigma-X-2 Sigma systems as examples.}},

   Zeeman splitting in a sunspot},

Abstract = {Spectroscopic observations at 1565 nm were made in the eastern half of
   the main umbra of NOAA 9885 on 1 April 2002 using the National Solar
   Observatory McMath-Pierce Telescope at Kitt Peak with a tip-tilt image
   stabilization system and the California State University Northridge
   National Solar Observatory infrared camera. The line depth of the OH
   blend at 1565.1 nm varies with the observed continuum temperature; the
   variation fits previous observations except that the continuum
   temperature is lower by 600 K. The equivalent width of the OH absorption
   line at 1565.2 nm shows a temperature dependence similar to previously
   published umbral molecular observations at 640 nm. A simple model of
   expected OH abundance based upon an ionization analogy to molecular
   dissociation is produced and agrees well with the temperature variation
   of the line equivalent width. A CN absorption line at 1564.6 nm shows a
   very different temperature dependence, likely due to complicated
   formation and destruction processes. Nonetheless a numerical fit of the
   temperature variation of the CN equivalent width is presented. Finally a
   comparison of the Zeeman splitting of the Fe I 1564.8 nm line with the
   sunspot temperature derived from the continuum intensity shows an umbra
   somewhat cooler for a given magnetic field strength than previous
   comparisons using this infrared 1564.8 nm line, but consistent with
   these previous infrared measurements the umbra is hotter for a given
   magnetic field strength than magnetic and temperature measurements at
   630.2 nm would suggest. Differences between the 630.2 nm and 1564.8 nm
   umbral temperature and magnetic field relations are explained with the
   different heights of formation of the lines and continua at these
   wavelengths.},

Abstract = {The host-guest charge transfer absorption of CN doped krypton and xenon
   matrices are identified through direct analogy with the previously
   assigned transitions of Cl/Kr and Cl/Xe. These intense, structured
   absorption bands appear with the onset at 245 nm in Kr and 360 nm in Xe.
   Excitation of the CN/Kr charge transfer band at 193 nm leads to emission
   over CN(A((2)Pi)-->X((2)Sigma)) transition, indicating that an efficient
   curve crossing precludes the ionic state from radiating. No emissions
   were seen in CN/Xe when excited at 193 nm. The charge transfer
   absorption spectrum of CN/Kr is reproduced through an extended
   diatomics-in-ionic-systems treatment, using accurate ab initio pair
   potentials and transition dipoles as input, without further adjustment.
   The delocalized hole states are then analyzed in real-space, using
   atomic bases distributed over as many as eleven shells surrounding the
   CN- center. The ionic states are well described as J=1/2, 3/2 valence
   bands bound to CN-, with a substructure that cannot be exclusively
   assigned to a single quantum number. The strong absorptions terminate on
   states in which 70\%-95\% of the hole density remains on the first
   nearest neighbor shell, with hole densities of 1\%-5\% extended out to
   R=8 Angstrom. In higher ionic states, with weaker transition dipoles,
   the hole density maximizes on shells removed by 10 Angstrom from the
   ionic center. Although these delocalized states provide channels for
   charge separation via self-trapping of holes, save for a weak signal
   from the impurity trapped hole at H+ centers, the experiments do not
   provide evidence for significant charge separation. (C) 2002 American

Abstract = {Cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) was used for measuring absolute
   concentration profiles of the CN (cyano) radical during oxyacetylene
   flame deposition of diamond. Profiles were measured for three different
   nitrogen additions to the flame. Novel ways for the determination of the
   lateral position of the laser beam and its height above the deposition
   substrate are presented. Measured column density profiles show that the
   influence of added nitrogen is limited to a central area within a radius
   of 2.7 mm. Outside this area the profiles are hardly influenced by the
   added nitrogen flow. Comparison with work of S. J. Firchow and K. L.
   Menningen {[}J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 32, 937 (1999)] shows a good
   correspondence. Absolute concentration profiles were obtained by
   applying Abel inversion processing and using a temperature distribution
   resulting from numerical simulations. The resulting profiles show an
   off-axis maximum for all three nitrogen additions. With an increasing
   nitrogen addition the maximum and central concentrations also increased.
   Upon inspection of the profiles it follows that the gas phase above the
   deposition area can be divided into three sections: a central one in
   which the added nitrogen is the dominant nitrogen source, an outer one
   where the nitrogen from the ambient plays a dominant role, and an
   intermediate zone where both nitrogen sources have a significant
   influence. The latter is the area in which the maximum of the CN
   concentration is situated. Previous laser-induced fluorescence (LIF)
   profiles of CN, measured under very similar experimental conditions,
   show similar distributions. Differences between the CRDS and LIF results
   are discussed. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {Scaled Feynman diagrams are proposed as perturbative corrections to the
   total energy. The proposal is tested by calculating potential energy
   curves for the valence states of the cyano radical. Unique features of
   the valence state are part of the starting approximation. The latter is
   computed with a standard quantum chemical method. For a particular
   method, the scale is independent of the valence state. At each bond
   distance, one set of quasiparticles and Feynman diagrams is used for all
   valence states. Scaling will be useful whenever perturbative corrections
   can be expressed with Feyman diagrams. In the cyano radical, competition
   for the odd electron between the sigma and pi orbitals produces a
   variety of valence states. Many are quasidegenerate. The 16 states
   investigated here are doublets and quartets with triple bonds, double
   bonds, `resonance' bonds, bonds intermediate to double and triple bonds,
   and bonds intermediate to single and double bonds. Energy curves and
   spectroscopic constants are reported for the lowest lying quartets and
   two or more lowest doublets of Sigma(+/-), Pi, and Delta symmetries, and
   also 1(2)Phi symmetry. Inner and outer minima in the energy curve for
   3(2)Pi are assigned to H and G, respectively. A more accurate assignment
   of a(4)Sigma(+) is made. Relative to experiment, maximum (average)
   errors in bond distance, frequency, and the adiabatic excitation energy
   are 1.6 pm (1 pm), 60 cm(-1) (50 cm(-1)), and 19 kJ/mol (5 kJ/mol),

   C-2 is produced by the 193 nm multiphoton photolysis of C2Cl4. The CN

   C-2 consumption rate coefficients are measured under pseudo-first-order

   molecule(-1) s(-1) with a 2sigma precision limit of +/-5\%. and a
   corresponding estimated accuracy limit of +/-20\%. The slight negative

   results are compared to the C-2 + NO measurements by Kruse and Roth for
   the 3150-3950 K temperature range and confirm that a mechanism change

   work, under otherwise constant conditions the CN(B-X) emission intensity
   increases with bath gas Ar pressure in the 5 to 100 mbar domain and
   decreases with further Ar addition. This increase in CN(B) population is

   were probed after a short delay by laser fluorescence excitation in the
   B-X (3,7) and B-A (3,3) bands. Final state distributions (relative
   state-to-state rate constants) are reported for CN(A)-Ar collisions; the
   rate constants for transitions induced by He were considerably smaller.
   Absolute total removal rate constants were also determined. A crossing
   of the A(2)Pi nu=3 F(1)f rotational/fine-structure manifold with the
   X(2)Sigma(+) nu=7 F-2 levels occurs at J = 62.5. The dependence of A -->
   X rate constants and the total removal rate constants on the initial
   level demonstrates the importance of this ``gateway{''} in facilitating
   collisions between these manifolds. The experimental CN(A)-Ar rate
   constants have been compared with theoretical rate constants computed in
   a quantum scattering treatment of the dynamics based on ab initio
   CN(A,X)-Ar potential energy surfaces. The small non-Born-Oppenheiiner
   mixing of the A and X states in the isolated CN molecule was also
   included in the calculations. The computed total removal rates show an
   enhanced value for the perturbed N = 62 F(1)f initial level, in
   agreement with experiment, but the computed state-to-state rate
   constants do not agree well with the experimentally determined values.},

Abstract = {Measurements on interstellar CN absorption are presented for stars in
   three southern OB associations, NGC 2439, Vela OB1, and Cen OB1. CN is
   detected in 21 out of 31 stars observed. The doublet ratio for the R(1)
   and P(1) lines of the (0, 0) band of the B (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Sigma(+)
   violet system and a comparison of violet system data with measurements
   of the (1, 0) and (2, 0) bands of the A (2)Pi-X (2)Sigma(+) red system
   are used to derive Doppler parameters and total column densities.
   Inferred CN column densities vary by more than an order of magnitude for
   lines of sight with similar CN column densities. Observations of the (0,
   0) band of the CH B (2)Sigma(-) -X (2)Pi system are used to revise
   previously published CH column densities toward the lines of sight
   studied in CN. Together with earlier results on CH, CH(+), and C(2), the
   CN data presented here provide a homogeneous set of column densities and
   radial velocities of diatomic molecules in three individual translucent
   clouds. We use these data to study CN production via chemical models.
   Gas densities are inferred from models based on production via CH and
   C(2) in cool gas. Most sightlines in our sample test densities typical
   for diffuse molecular gas (a few hundred cm(-3)) when the ultraviolet
   flux permeating the gas is between 1 and 5 times the average
   interstellar flux. A few lines of sight indicate that CN is produced
   under dark cloud conditions because relatively large densities are
   obtained or because this simple chemical scheme is unable to reproduce
   the observed CN columns. Low densities are indicated for directions with
   upper limits on CN. We add an ad hoc component of a number of
   low-velocity (<10 km s(-1)) criss-crossing MHD shocks to explain
   observed column densities of interstellar CH(+). These shocks also
   produce about 10 to 30\% of the total CH column along the line of sight.},

   the goal of achieving chemical accuracy. The contribution of the diffuse
   functions in the case of neutral O-2 (0.6 kcal/mol) is by no means
   negligible in this context. A serious discrepancy between the
   theoretical prediction and the experimental values available for the
   dissociation energy of C-2(-) was found. Since the theoretical
   deficiences commonly ascribed to the CCSDT method (single-reference and
   spin contamination when using UHF zeroth-order wave functions) cannot be

Abstract = {Starting from either the exchange or the exchange-correlation density
   together with Bader's definition of an atom in a molecule, an atomic
   hole density function can be defined. Contour maps of atomic hole
   density functions are able to show how the electron density of each atom
   in a molecule is partially delocalized into the rest of atoms in the
   molecule. The degree of delocalization of the atomic density ultimately
   depends on the nature of the atom studied and its environment. Atomic
   hole density functions are also used to define an atomic similarity
   measure, which allows for the quantitative assessment of the degree of
   atomic transferability in different molecular environments. In this
   article, contour maps for the N atom in the (N-2, CN-, NO+) series and
   the O atom in the (CO, H2CO, and HCOOH) series are presented at the
   Hartree-Fock and CISD levels of theory. Moreover, the transferability of
   N and O within the two series is studied by means of atomic similarity
   measures. O 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Abstract = {Total rotational energy transfer (RET) rate constants, state-to-state
   RET rate constants, and radiative lifetimes have been measured for CN(B
   (2)Sigma (+), upsilon =0, N-i=0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 13). All experiments
   were conducted under single collision conditions in a static cell filled
   with previously prepared C2N2/He mixtures at various total pressures up
   to a maximum of 800 mTorr. The above initial states were prepared by
   pumping CN(X) with a pulsed dye laser tuned to appropriate frequencies
   in the P-branch of the CN-violet (0,0) band following the production of
   CN(X) by the excimer laser photolysis of C2N2 at 157 nm. Total RET rate
   constants and radiative lifetimes were determined from decay constants
   obtained with a transient digitizer over the above range of cell
   pressures. State-to-state RET rate constants were obtained from
   time-averaged fluorescence spectra in the R branch of the (0,0) band of
   the CN violet system at various cell pressures within the above range. A
   weak propensity for odd jumps in N was discernable in state-to-state RET
   rate constants in CN(B)/He collisions for N >4. Total RET rate constants
   varied only slightly with N-i for 0 less than or equal toN(i)less than
   or equal to 19 with He as collision partner, but decreased monotonically
   with increasing N-i when C2N2 served as collision partner. No firm
   evidence for collisionally induced CN(B)<----> CN(A) was apparent from

Abstract = {Calculations of 11 diatomic dissociation energies with coupled cluster

   (through septuple zeta in some cases) and complete basis set
   extrapolations with corrections for core/valence correlation, scalar

   achieve excellent agreement with experiment in most cases. However, for
   C-2 and CN the extent of the multiconfigurational nature of the
   molecules caused problems for the single configuration-based couple
   cluster methods. In the worse case, the inclusion of iterative triples
   resulted in a change with respect to the perturbative triples result
   which was of the opposite sign to the full configuration interaction
   change. This work emphasizes the difficulties in achieving uniform
   chemical accuracy even for ground state, first and second row diatomics.

Abstract = {The boundary layer of a C/SiC tile in a low pressure nitrogen/carbon

   CN emission is especially studied through its red and violet systems.
   Radial and axial profiles of CN relative density are obtained and

   Rotational and vibrational temperatures are determined and compared with
   wall, heavy particle, and electron temperatures. High vibronic bands
   should be taken into account in order to determine accurate vibrational
   temperatures. Delta upsilon = 0 sequence of the violet system is
   examined in detail and differences between calculations made using
   existing sets of spectroscopic constants and experimental spectra are
   pointed out. Inadequacy of very accurate Fourier transform spectroscopy
   (FTS) sets of constants in high temperature calculations is underlined.
   CN and NO density increases in the boundary layer are explained through
   a dissociative adsorption of N-2(upsilon) or N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)). Such a
   process implies a significant action of nitrogen in surface erosion.

   data, CN(A)+H(2) collisional energy transfer was examined at

   collisions showed symmetry preferences that were not evident in the
   distributions resulting from predissociation. It is argued that the lack

   a resonant scattering process. Qualitative differences in the
   predissociation and collisional transfer dynamics can be explained by
   considering the symmetry properties of the intermolecular potential
   energy surfaces, and the regions of these surfaces that are sampled by

   The three electronically adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PES's 2A'

   which describes the coupling between the two diabatic PES's of A'
   symmetry which correlate asymptotically with the X (2)Sigma(+) and A
   (2)Pi states of CN. The appropriate diabatic PES's are then used in the
   study of rotationally inelastic scattering of CN(A (2)Pi) in collisions
   with Ar. Experimental state-to-state rate constants were measured with
   an optical-optical double resonance technique. The CN radical was
   prepared by 193 nm photolysis of BrCN diluted in slowly flowing argon at
   a total pressure of similar to 0.5 Torr. Specific fine-structure

   relative and absolute, were determined for several rotational levels
   with J=6.5 and 7.5. The final state distributions displayed an even-odd
   alternation as a function of the final angular momentum J for scattering
   into certain fine-structure Lambda-doublet manifolds. The measured
   state-to-state rate constants agreed quite well with rate constants
   derived from quantum scattering calculations with the ab initio CN(A

Abstract = {The analyses of high resolution infrared spectra have been done for CN
   lines in oxygen-rich cool evolved stars including 2 K giants, 20 M
   giants and 1 S-type star. Since CN lines analyzed in the present work
   are weak and resolved well, they are appropriate for quantitative
   analyses. CN lines of Delta nu = -2 and -1 sequences (red system) which
   are in the K-and the H-window regions, respectively, give the consistent
   nitrogen abundance for each star. The analyses of NH lines in the
   L-window region have been done for 5 late M giants for which CN lines
   have been also analyzed. Although the triplet structure of NH lines
   cannot be fully resolved, they are preferable because determination of
   nitrogen abundance is almost independent of other elemental abundances
   while nitrogen abundance based on CN depends on carbon abundance. The
   nitrogen abundances derived from NH for late M giants agree well with
   those from CN for which we adopt 7.75 eV as the dissociation energy in
   the analysis.
   The results show that the nitrogen abundances in late M giants are
   larger than those in early M giants while decrease of the carbon
   abundance was found in late M giants by our previous work (Tsuji 1991).
   These variations of abundances can not be explained by the first
   dredge-up model but require additional processing by the CN cycle and
   mixing after the first dredge-up. However, there is no obvious evidence
   of other processes such as the 3 alpha-process and subsequent hot bottom
   burning in our program stars. Such variation of the carbon and nitrogen
   abundances is not well understood by the present evolutionary models of
   low-mass and intermediate-mass stars.},

   abundances that are twice the heavy element (Fe) abundance in the range
   from {[}Fe/H]=+0.10 to -3.0 dex but for about one-half the giants, and a
   third of the dwarfs, with {[}FeM]<-1.5 dex, the H and K and (or) H

Abstract = {We propose that the generalization of pure spin single reference excited
   state theories from molecules with closed shell ground states to
   radicals be based on a redefinition of the meaning of excitation levels.
   Open shell single substitutions are expanded to include spin-adapted
   double excitations which traverse the singly occupied orbitals. These
   excitations are deleted from the expanded open shell double
   substitutions, which include the corresponding spin-adapted triple
   substitutions (e.g., a pair of the excitations traverses the singly
   occupied orbitals), etc. Applied to single excitation configuration
   interaction (CIS), this approach defines a spin-adapted extended CIS
   (XCIS) theory for the excited states of radicals. XCIS is size
   consistent and variational and has computational complexity that scales
   in the same way as CIS with molecular size. More low-lying excited
   states of radicals are correctly described by XCIS than by the
   restricted open shell CIS method. This is demonstrated by calculations
   on excited states of seven diatomic radicals and the methyl,
   nitromethyl, benzyl, phenoxyl, and anilino radicals.},

Abstract = {Quantitative, narrow-line laser absorption measurements of CN
   time-histories at 388.444 nm were acquired in high-temperature pyrolysis
   and laser photolysis shock tube experiments. The data were analyzed
   using a detailed kinetics mechanism to determine the rate coefficients
   of the reactions
   CN + OH --> Products (1)
   CN + HCN --> C2N2 + H (2)
   CN + H-2 --> HCN + H (3)
   for temperatures between 940 and 1860 K. Two independent experimental
   approaches were utilized: laser photolysis (at 193 nm) of dilute
   C2N2/HCN/argon and C2N2/H-2/argon mixtures in reflected shock wave
   experiments, and shock heating of HNO3/HCN/argon mixtures in incident
   and reflected shock wave experiments. Laser absorption measurements of
   OH at 306.687 nm were also taken in the HNO3/HCN/argon experiments. The
   results are in good agreement with rate coefficient determinations from
   previous studies at different temperatures. The expression
   k(2) = 1.51 X 10(7) T-1.71 exp(-770/T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) (f = 0.85, F
   = 1.15),
   derived by Yang et al. (1992) from their k(2) measurements in
   combination with those of Szekely et al. (1983), is recommended for the
   broad temperature range 300-3000 K, The uncertainty factors f and F give
   the limiting values of the rate coefficient: k(min) = f(best fit),
   k(max) = Fk(best fit). The recommended expression for the rate
   coefficient of reaction (3)
   k(3) = 2.95 X 10(5) T-2.45 exp(-1126/T) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) (f = 0.83, F
   = 1.22),
   also valid for temperatures 300-1000 K, is taken from the transition
   state theory analysis of the CN + H-2 reaction by Wagner and Bair
   (1986). The rate coefficient for reaction (1) was measured to be 4.0 X
   10(13) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) (f = 0.61, F = 1.40) For the temperature
   range 1250-1860 K. (C) 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Abstract = {Simultaneous, quantitative, narrow-line laser absorption measurements of
   CN time-histories at 388.444 nn and OH time-histories at 306.687 nm have
   been made in incident and reflected shock wave experiments using dilute
   mixtures of nitric acid (HNO3) and HCN in argon. The thermal
   decomposition of HNO3 serves as a rapid source of OH upon shock-heating,
   and the OH subsequently reacts predominantly with the KCN in the test
   gas mixture. The rate coefficient for the reaction
   (1a) HCN + OH --> CN + H2O
   was determined in the temperature range 1120-1960 K via detailed
   kinetics modeling of the simultaneously acquired CN and OK measurements.
   These data are in good agreement with lower temperature measurements of
   the rate of the reverse reaction (-1a) when recent values of the heats
   of formation of CN and HCN are used. The expression
   k(1a) = 3.90 x 10(6)T(1.83) exp(-5179/T) cm(3)mol(-1)s(-1),
   valid for temperatures 500 to 2000 K, effectively represents the
   experimental measurements. The estimated uncertainty of the expression
   for k(1a) is +/- 30\%, based on the experimental uncertainties of the
   individual rate coefficient studies. Analysis of the decay region of the
   experimental OH time-histories yielded the total rate coefficient k(1)
   (all product channels) for the reaction of HCN with OH for temperatures
   ranging from 1490 to 1950 K. These measurements are consistent with a
   previous theoretical analysis of the three primary
   addition-isomerization-dissociation processes for the HCN + OH reaction
   at combustion temperatures when the contribution to k(1) from reaction
   (1a) is included. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons; Inc.},

Abstract = {The problem of rotational energy transfer (RET) is examined from a point
   of view intermediate between the current approaches based on empirical
   models or numerical solution of the coupled scattering equations. A
   semiclassical perspective is taken in which a classically described
   collision with an atom exerts a time dependent torque on the rotor and
   the resulting forced rotor dynamics is addressed quantum mechanically.
   By treating the anharmonicity in the rotational energy levels as a
   perturbation, a simple approximate expression is found for the inelastic
   transition probability. It reveals a marked difference between the
   distribution of final rotational states incurred from an individual
   collision trajectory as compared to trajectory averaged measures of RET,
   such as cross sections. The theory is applied to the scattering of
   Li-2(A (1) Sigma(u)(+)) by Ne, Ar, Xe;Na-2(A (1) Sigma(u)(+)) by He and
   Ne; N-2(+)(X (2) Sigma(g)(+)) by He, and CN(X (2) Sigma(+)) by He. Its
   predictions compare well with those from a fully quantum mechanical
   description of rigid rotor scattering and with experiment. The insight
   into the energy transfer dynamics gained from the semiclassical approach
   is used to examine the assumptions underlying empirical models of
   rotational energy transfer. (C) 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {We have calculated a grid of more than 700 model atmospheres valid for a
   wide range of parameters encompassing the coolest known M dwarfs, M
   subdwarfs, and brown dwarf candidates: 1500 less than or equal to T-eff
   less than or equal to 4000 K, 3.5 less than or equal to log g less than
   or equal to 5.5, and -4.0 less than or equal to {[}M/H] less than or
   equal to + 0.5.
   Our equation of state includes 105 molecules and up to 27 ionization
   stages of 39 elements. In the calculations of the base grid of model
   atmospheres presented here, we include over 300 molecular bands of four
   molecules (TiO, VO, CaH, FeH) in the JOLA approximation, the water
   opacity of Ludwig (1971), collision-induced opacities, b-f and f-f
   atomic processes, as well as about 2 million spectral lines selected
   from a list with more than 42 million atomic and 24 million molecular
   (H-2, CH, NH, OH, MgH, SiH, C-2, CN, CO, SiO) lines. High-resolution
   synthetic spectra are obtained using an opacity sampling method. The
   model atmospheres and spectra are calculated with the generalized
   stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX, assuming LTE, plane-parallel geometry,
   energy (radiative plus convective) conservation, and hydrostatic
   equilibrium.
   The model spectra give close agreement with observations of M dwarfs
   across a wide spectral range from the blue to the near-IR, with one
   notable exception: the fit to the water bands. We discuss several
   practical applications of our model grid, e.g., broadband colors derived
   from the synthetic spectra. In light of current efforts to identify
   genuine brown dwarfs, we also show how low-resolution spectra of cool
   dwarfs vary with surface gravity, and how the high-resolution line
   profile of the Li I resonance doublet depends on the Li abundance.},

   that collisional effects are observable in the CN spectra of relatively
   high production rate comets, such as Halley and Levy. Moreover, the
   model confirms that the overall structure of the CN spectra in comets
   results predominantly from pure fluorescence governed by the Swings

   the use of a single-shot laser pulse with planar laser-induced

   visualization. In addition, the images obtained have good spatial
   resolution of 200 mu m. Based on a laminar flame experiment with the
   same optical systems, it is observed that the CN distribution zone is
   located outside of the inner cone even at atmospheric pressure.},

Abstract = {The CN(B2SIGMA+-X2SIGMA+) emission spectrum produced in the reaction of
   Ar(3P2) with BrCN was observed by the use of a flowing afterglow method
   at argon pressures ranging from 9 mTorr to 2 Torr (1 Torr = 133.322 Pa).
   The pressure dependences of the intensity anomalies in the rotational
   lines due to the B2SIGMA+ approximately A2PI(i) and the B2SIGMA+
   approximately 4SIGMA+ perturbations were measured by introducing
   collision-partner gases in the reaction region.  These pressure
   dependences can be explained by the `'doorway'' model.  On the other
   hand, the measured pressure dependence of the effective rotational
   temperature in the CN(B2SIGMA+) state can also be reproduced by the
   collision-induced rotational relaxation model.  The cross section for
   the rotational relaxation in the A2PI(i) state was found to be smaller
   than those in the B2SIGMA+ and 4SIGMA+ states.  This finding is

Title = {THE 1ST DETAILED ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS OF GALACTIC BULGE-K GIANTS IN BAADE
   WINDOW},
Journal = APJS,

Volume = {91},

Abstract = {We report analysis of echelle spectra (R = 17,000, S/N almost-equal-to
   50) of 12 Galactic bulge K giants in Baade's window from the sample of
   Rich ( 1988). We perform an abundance analysis for 11 stars ranging from
   {[}Fe/H] = -1 to {[}Fe/H] = 0.45. The accuracy of our abundance scale is
   confirmed relative to the disk super-metal-rich stars via the metal-rich
   giant mu Leonis, and to the Galactic globular clusters using a star in
   NGC 5927.
   We investigate the effects of CN blends on abundance analysis for stars
   more metal-rich than {[}Fe/H] = -0.3, through spectrum synthesis of the
   region from 6140 to 7600 angstrom, including in excess of 8000 (CN)-C-12
   and (CN)-C-13 lines. We confirm Peterson's assertion that blends of
   atomic lines with CN vibration-rotation lines can affect abundance
   results at R = 17,000; failure to reject affected Fe lines would have
   resulted in a spurious 0.3 dex increase in the derived Fe abundances of
   our most metal-rich stars.
   We find that one of the most metal-rich Baade's window stars (BW IV-167)
   has approximately the same metallicity as the super-metal-rich disk
   giant mu Leo. The abundance scale of Rich (1988), based on measurement
   of strong Fe and Mg lines, is almost-equal-to 0.3 dex high but may agree
   with our results if Rich's {[}M/H] actually measures {[}(Fe + Mg)/H].
   Using our abundances to transform Rich's {[}M/H] distribution, we find
   that the mean {[}Fe/H] is -0.25 for the bulge, slightly less than, but
   not appreciably different from, the mean {[}Fe/H] for solar neighborhood
   G and K giants. Surprisingly, this is not in conflict with the Galactic
   metallicity gradient found for the solar neighborhood. The extant data
   on {[}Fe/H] with Galactocentric radius are completely consistent with a
   zero gradient within the solar circle.
   Infrared flux temperatures for a sample of 34 Baade's window K giants
   observed by Frogel \& Whitford ( 1987) show that the bulge (J - K)
   versus T(eff) relation is identical to that of the solar neighborhood.
   We assert that the observed infrared colors reflect the actual effective
   temperatures, and that infrared colors affected by molecular blanketing
   cannot explain why the bulge giant branch is as blue as that of 47 Tuc.
   Verification of the (J - K) temperature scale, and use of our average
   {[}Fe/H] results, suggest that the Frogel \& Whitford ( 1987) infrared
   H-R diagram requires that the mean mass of Baade's window giants can be
   no less than about 1.1 M..
   Abundances for the alpha-elements are based on spectrum synthesis of
   lines due to Mg, Ti, Ca, and Si. We find a puzzling pattern in the
   trends of element abundance ratios with {[} Fe/ H 1. Mg and Ti are
   enhanced by almost-equal-to 0.3 dex relative to solar over almost the
   full {[}Fe/H] range. In contrast, Ca and Si closely follow the normal
   trends for disk giants, with solar ratios occurring above {[}Fe/H]
   almost-equal-to -0.2. The enrichment pattern of bulge giants sets them
   clearly apart from disk giants of the same {[}Fe/H]. For a subset of the
   sample we estimate {[}O/Fe] almost-equal-to O using the {[}O I] line at
   6300 angstrom; the absence of a carbon abundance indicator requires us
   to assume a solar C/Fe ratio. We speculate that the high Mg abundances
   seen in ellipticals (Worthey, Faber, \& Gonzalez 1992) may reflect a
   common enrichment process for bulges and ellipticals. We further propose
   that the high Ti abundances may largely account for the tendency for
   Baade's window M giants to have later spectral types than solar
   neighborhood M giants of the same infrared color (Frogel \& Whitford
   1987).
   Other noteworthy results include enhanced Al abundances similar to those
   seen in globular cluster giants, and (tentatively) enhancement of the
   r-process element Eu in the metal-rich bulge stars. The iron-peak and
   s-process elements appear normal relative to Fe. We find one
   super-Li-rich giant, BW I-194. We also identify BW I-155 as a
   spectroscopic double.
   This work also presents the following results of general use to
   investigators in the field: (1) In order to obtain a complete set of g f
   values for our Fe i lines, we find transformations between numerous log
   g f sources. In total we provide a list of 208 atomic g f values, for Fe
   I and numerous other species. (2) We present a list of uncontaminated
   continuum regions appropriate for use in metal-rich stars, as well as
   atomic lines clear from severe CN blending at a variety of
   metallicities.},

Abstract = {The correlated angular distribution of translational and rotational
   motion of photofragments is probed by Doppler-broadened transient
   absorption line shapes. The one-photon nature of the probe process
   reduces the complexity of the analysis, while maintaining sensitivity to
   five bipolar moments of the translational and rotational angular
   distributions. The 193-nm photodissociation of C2H5SCN illustrates the
   method, with CN products detected with a titanium:sapphire ring laser
   probing the A2PI-X2SIGMA+ transition. The vector correlations in the
   high rotational states of CN indicate a direct dissociation following a
   transition of mixed symmetry at 193 nm: the recoil is preferentially but
   not exclusively parallel to a transition moment, and the perpendicular
   component is dominated by a rotation axis parallel to a C2H5SCN
   transition moment. The strong rotational excitation is generated by
   planar bending forces in a bent excited state. Lower rotational states
   are formed with a composite kinetic energy distribution, indicating an
   additional, slower, less highly polarized channel that partitions more
   energy into the unobserved C2H5S radical than does the direct channel.
   At 248 nm, a weaker absorption also generates CN photofragments with a
   preferentially parallel recoil, requiring a reassessment of the
   excited-state assignments in the alkyl thiocyanates.},

Abstract = {Tunable dye laser excitation of CN near 6000 angstrom in an atmospheric

   2SIGMA+ system fluorescence, detected in the DELTAupsilon = 0 region
   (almost-equal-to 3860 angstrom). Analysis shows that four different
   mechanisms contribute to the spectrum in overlapping laser wavelength
   regions: (1) In the range from 5890-6016 angstrom, the spectrum is
   dominated by transitions in the B 2SIGMA+-A 2PI (0,0) band. This
   technique can be used with care as a quantitative CN A 2PI diagnostic in
   flames. (2) In the range 6016-6180 angstrom the excitation spectrum is
   positively identified as that of the A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (8, 3) and (9, 4)
   bands. However, fluorescence occurs from the B 2SIGMA+ state which can
   be populated only by collisional uptransfer. Part of the A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+
   (10, 5) band near 6300 angstrom has also been observed via the same
   mechanism; however, because A 2PI, upsilon = 10 is nearly iso-energetic
   with B 2SIGMA+, upsilon = 0 endoergic collisions are not necessary to
   promote the intersystem crossing. (3) In the range 6180-6298 angstrom,
   the spectrum consists mainly of lines produced by a collision-assisted
   single-color optical-optical double resonance (OODR). The first photon
   of the OODR is absorbed in the A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (4, 0) band, the second
   in the B 2SIGMA+-A 2PI (3, 4) band. The density of lines in the region
   is possible only if collisional rotational relaxation occurs in the
   intermediate A 2PI, upsilon = 4 level during the laser pulse. (4) In the
   same wavelength region (6180-6298 angstrom) a second, independent
   process occurs: near-resonant two-photon excitation (NR2PE) in the B
   2SIGMA+-X 2SIGMA+ (3, 0) band by means of intermediate A 2PI, upsilon =
   4 rotational levels. The only B 2SIGMA+-X 2SIGMA+ (3, 0) NR2PE
   transitions observed are those for which the laser is detuned from a
   resonance in A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (4, 0) by less than 20 cm-1. This
   two-photon absorption process is independent of collisional conditions.
   The observed spectra illustrate some of the unexpected effects of
   collisions and laser intensity on absorption and fluorescence in this
   molecule, characterized by multiple low-lying electronic states.},

   The frequency predictions used for the lowest three electronic

   emission. The vibrational distribution of CN(B) produced from KCN was
   bimodal: one dominated in v' = 0-3 and the other in v' = 11-19. In the
   latter channel, more than 90\% of the available energy is transmitted to
   the vibrational motion of the product, CN(B,v' = 11-19). On the other
   hand, only CN(B) in the low vibrational states (v' = 0-3) was produced
   from NaCN. The bimodal vibrational distribution of CN(B) from KCN
   implies that CN(B,v' = 0-3) and CN(B,v' = 11-19) were produced through
   different reaction channels; the former was produced in the direct
   dissociation on a repulsive potential energy surface and the latter in
   the predissociation through an excited ion-pair state with a long
   equilibrium internuclear distance between C and N. The direct
   dissociation was explained by use of classical dynamics simulations. It
   was concluded that in the reaction of NaCN, the energetics restricts the

Abstract = {Time-histories of the CN radical were monitored using a tunable ring dye
   laser to measure absorption at the P-branch bandhead of the B2SIGMA+ <--
   X2SIGMA+ (0, 0) band of CN in a shock tube. Measurements of CN resulting
   from the pyrolysis of highly dilute mixtures of C2N2 in Ar were compared
   with a spectroscopic model, and the location of maximum absorption for
   the bandhead was determined to be 25743.72 cm-1 (lambda = 388.444 nm). A
   second set of experiments at the maximum absorption frequency was
   conducted for temperatures between 2700 and 4900 K and pressures between
   0.34 and 1.0 atm. These measurements were used to determine an
   expression for the effective collisional broadening coefficient.
   Correlation of the data with the spectroscopic model led to a
   temperature- and pressure-dependent expression for the absorption
   coefficient. For P = 1 atm, this expression is of the form    k(v)(T, 1
   atm)     {[}cm-1 atm-1] = a/T3 + b/T2 + c/T,  where     a = -9.95984 x
   10(13), b = 1.13891 x 10(11), and c = -1.16132 x 10(7); it agrees with
   the spectroscopic model within 1\% for the temperature range 2000 < T <
   5000 K. The corresponding uncertainty of the absorption coefficient for
   this expression is +/- 15\% for T < 3000 K and +/- 5\% for T > 3300 K.
   The detection limit of the CN diagnostic is 0.1\% absorption, which
   corresponds to a CN detection sensitivity of 0.02 ppm at T = 3600 K, P =
   1 atm, and a path length of 14.3 cm.},

Abstract = {We report on spectroscopic observations for 1044 stars, located
   primarily in the southern Galactic hemisphere, chosen from a list of
   candidate metal-deficient stars discovered in the HK objective-prism
   survey. Metal abundances for the program stars, on the {[}Fe/H] scale,
   are obtained from a previously published calibration of the variation in
   the equivalent width of the Ca II K absorption line (lambda-3933
   angstrom) as a function of broadband (B-V)0 color. Broadband UBV
   photometry is available for roughly one-third of the present sample. For
   the majority of stars without available photometry (primarily stars with
   an inferred {[}Fe/H] > -2.0), we obtain estimated dereddened (B-V)0
   colors from an empirical calibration of the variation of Balmer line
   equivalent width with broadband color. Radial velocities, with
   accuracies on the order of 10 km s-1, are obtained for all our program
   stars. Distance estimates, accurate to 10\%-15\%, are reported for the
   subsample of program stars with available photometry. Less accurate
   distances are obtained for the remaining stars by a calibration of
   apparent magnitude with crude brightness estimates from the original
   survey plates. The sample reported here includes 734 stars with {[}Fe/H]
   less-than-or-equal-to -1.0, 446 stars with {[}Fe/H]
   less-than-or-equal-to -2.0, 70 stars with {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to
   -3.0, and at least three stars with {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -4.0.
   Due to uncertainties in the calibration of our metal-abundance
   determinations for late-type stars, the actual number of stars with
   {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -4.0 in the present sample may be on the
   order of 5-10. Fifty stars in our sample exhibit anomalously strong G
   bands, characteristic of the subgiant CH stars discussed by Bond. Among
   the most metal-deficient objects (as inferred from their Ca II K
   equivalent widths), we identify six stars with moderate to strong CN
   bands. The present program stars form the basis for addressing a wide
   range of questions concerning the formation and evolution of the
   Galactic halo population, and, by inference, the nature of the first
   generations of star formation in the universe. The number of extremely
   metal-poor stars ({[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -2.0) reported in the
   present sample is roughly quadruple the sample size of nonkinematically
   selected stars of similar metal abundance reported by previous workers,
   and is on the order of the total previous samples of stars in this
   abundance regime when all sources are included. The number of stars with
   {[}Fe/H] less-than-or-equal-to -3.0 in the present sample is seven times
   the number of previously identified stars with spectroscopically
   determined abundances which are this low. We emphasize, however, that
   the present sample only represents on the order of 10\% of the number of
   such extreme objects that remain to be discovered upon completion of the
   follow-up spectroscopy and photometry of metal-deficient candidates
   identified in our ongoing objective-prism survey.},

Abstract = {An algebraic approach is proposed to calculate the Franck-Condon factors
   for the Morse potential of diatomic molecules. The Morse oscillator is
   approximated by means of a fourth-order anharmonic oscillator. In the
   second-quantized formalism, this anharmonic Hamiltonian is diagonalized
   by way of the Bogoliubov-Tyablikov transformation. The Franck-Condon
   factors are estimated using the harmonic frequency equivalent and the
   recurrence relations for the Franck-Condon factors of the harmonic
   oscillator. Overlap integrals are shown for three band systems and
   compared with values calculated with an RKR potential. Excellent
   agreement is achieved.},

   measured as a function of the pressure of Ar or He introduced as a
   collision partner in the reaction region, the ambient pressure being
   varied from 9 to 2000 mTorr (1 Torr = 133.322 Pa). The intensities of
   the perturbed lines relative to that of the rotational band envelope
   increased with the ambient pressure in the low pressure region in the

   in the higher pressure region. The pressure dependence of the intensity
   anomaly for He followed that for Ar, although higher pressure of He was
   necessary to attain the same level of the intensity anomaly for Ar.
   These pressure dependences can be explained semiquantitatively by a

Abstract = {The dependence of the electronic transition moment R(e)(R) for the
   B2-SIGMA+-X2-SIGMA+ transition of CN on the internuclear distance R is
   determined by an analysis of the relative intensity of its emission
   spectrum.  In the present analysis of the spectrum, the relative values
   of R(e)(R) are directly evaluated by use of the vibrational integrals,
   <upsilon'\textbackslash{}R(n)\textbackslash{}upsilon{''}> (n = 1,2,...),
   instead of the r-centroid approximation, which is found to be inadequate
   particularly in the tail bands (upsilon' greater-than-or-equal-to 10).
   The validity of the r-centroid approximation is discussed on the basis
   of the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potentials of the B2-SIGMA+ and
   X2-SIGMA+ states.  The R dependence of the R(e)(R) value is interpreted
   in terms of the electronic wave function of B2-SIGMA+; the
   configuration-interaction (CI) coefficients for the electronic
   configurations of the B2-SIGMA+ state are estimated.  The CI
   coefficients obtained in the present study, as well as those for the

Abstract = {In molecular clouds of modest density and relatively high fractional
   ionization {[}n(e)/n(H-2) > 10(-5)], the rotational excitation of CN is
   controlled by a competition among electron impact, neutral impact
   (primarily H-2), and the interaction with the cosmic background
   radiation.  The degree of excitation can be measured through optical
   absorption lines and millimeter-wave emission lines.  The available,
   accurate data on CN in diffuse and translucent molecular clouds are
   assembled and used to determine electron densities.  The derived values,
   n(e) almost-equal-to 0.02-0.5 cm-3, imply modest neutral densities in
   the range 10(2.5) - 10(3.5) cm-3, which generally agree well with
   determinations by other techniques.  The absorption- and emission-line
   measurements of CN both exclude densities higher than n(H-2)
   almost-equal-to 10(3.5) cm-3 on scales varying from 10(-3) to 60{''} in
   these clouds.},

Title = {ELECTRONIC SPECTROSCOPY OF THE CYANOGEN HALIDES},
Journal = JPC,
Year = {1991},
Volume = {95},
Number = {2},
Pages = {639-656},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {The electronic absorption spectra of the cyanogen halides, XCN where X =
   Cl, Br, and I, have been investigated in the range 3100-1050 angstrom.
   The spectra are analyzed in terms of vibronic structure, oscillator
   strengths, and effective quantum numbers.  The spectra of the cyanogen
   halides exhibit no regular Rydberg structure.  The absence of regularity
   is shown to be a direct consequence of the presence of intravalence
   excitations and Rydberg/valence interactions.  In confirmation of the
   above, the intravalence transitions arising from the 2-pi-->(5-delta,
   3-pi, and 6-delta) configurational excitations are observed and
   assigned.  In addition, we presume to extract ``term values{''} for the
   antibonding 5-delta, 3-pi, and 6-delta MOs and then use these to predict
   the energies of the remaining nine low-energy intravalence excitations
   of the cyanogen halides, \{4-delta; 1-pi; 3-delta\}-->\{5-delta; 3-pi;
   6-delta\}.  There is a danger in this, in that we seem, too blithely
   perhaps, to make use of a simple one-electron MO model in situations
   where it is known that many-electron effects may dominate.  We believe
   that the use of one-electron considerations is moderated by the
   extensive use of a vast amount of empirical, correlative experimental
   data.  Finally, all excited states that arise from the 12 low-energy
   intravalence excitations are correlated with the states of the separated
   halogen atom and CN radical such that photoprocesses in the cyanogen
   halides may be rationalized.  The A-band and alpha-band continua are
   assigned as 2-pi-->5-delta, 1,3II and 2-pi-->3-pi; 1,3-DELTA,
   1,3-SIGMA+,1,3-SIGMA- configurational excitations, respectively.  The
   4-delta-->5-delta;1-SIGMA+ transition is associated with the discrete
   structure atop the alpha continuum; the intense, discrete band systems
   that lie to the blue of the B and C Rydberg band systems are associated
   with the 2-pi-->6-delta;1,3II intravalence transitions.  The states that
   arise from the remaining eight configurational excitations are shown to
   be mostly dissociative in nature.  The correlation scheme predicts (i)
   CN (X2-SIGMA+) to be the primary product of photolysis within the A
   continua; (ii) CN (A2II(i)) to be the primary product of photolysis from
   the onset of the alpha continua up to photon energies of 80 000 cm-1 for
   each of the cyanogen halides, and (iii) CN (B2-SIGMA+) to be a primary
   product for photon energies greater than approximately 105 000, 94 000,
   and 80 000 cm-1 in CICN, BrCN, and ICN, respectively.},

Abstract = {The background-corrected Zeeman absorbance baseline shows shifts for
   lines of several hollow cathode lamps up to tenths of an absorbance unit
   with firings of an empty graphite furnace atomiser and clear differences
   in the sizes of the shifts according to whether the furnace is purged
   with nitrogen or argon. Baseline shifts are seen for hollow cathode
   lines close to listed rotation lines of the (0,0) and higher bands of
   the CN violet system. Such shifts, it is suggested, are caused by
   overlap of the hollow cathode lines with Zeeman-shifted CN lines and in
   support of this suggestion the known behaviour of CN lines in magnetic
   fields (spin doublet contraction) is cited. Evidence is presented for
   the existence of interfering CN lines near the main atomic absorption
   line of Cr (357.9 nm), as a spectral interference occurs in both the
   inverse Zeeman configuration (with lamps containing iron) and with
   continuum source correction.},
