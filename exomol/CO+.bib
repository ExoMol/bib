abstract = {The emission spectrum of the B2Σ+−X2Σ+ system of the less abundant 12C17O+ isotopologue has been recorded at high resolution in the ultraviolet wavelength region using a Fourier transform spectrometer. The 12C17O+ molecules were produced and excited in a graphite hollow-cathode discharge lamp, in the presence of approximately 0.2 Torr of isotopically enriched molecular oxygen 17O2. The study includes four bands, i.e. 0−0 (analyzed for the first time) and 0−1, 0−2, 0−3 (reanalyzed), covering over 500 ro-vibronic transitions measured with an absolute accuracy of 0.0060–0.0100 cm−1. A rotational analysis of these bands was performed using the PGOPHER program, and molecular constants for the B2Σ+, ν=0 and X2Σ+, ν=0−3 levels were extracted.}

Abstract = {Carbon monoxide cation (CO+) plays a dominant role in some astrophysical
   atmosphere environments, and theoretical research on its opacity is
   crucial for modeling radiative transport. In this work, based on
   experimentally observed vibrational energy levels of the X-2 Sigma(+),
   A(2)Pi, and B-2 Sigma(+) electronic states of CO+, the potential energy
   curves are improved and constructed using a modified Morse (MMorse)
   potential function, then the vibrational energy levels and spectroscopic
   constants are extracted. In the meantime, the internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method with Davison
   size-extensivity correction (+Q) is used to calculate the potential
   energy curves and transition dipole moments. The refined MMorse
   potential shows excellent agreement with the computed potential energy
   curves, while the spectroscopic constants and vibrational levels
   indicate strong consistency with existing theoretical and experimental
   data. The opacities of the CO+ molecule is computed at different
   temperatures under the pressure of 100 atm. The result shows that as
   temperature rises, the opacities of transitions in the long-wavelength
   range increases because of the larger population on excited electronic
   states at higher temperatures. All the data presented in this paper are
   openly available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00213.00136.},
