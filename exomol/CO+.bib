Abstract = {Carbon monoxide cation (CO+) plays a dominant role in some astrophysical
   atmosphere environments, and theoretical research on its opacity is
   crucial for modeling radiative transport. In this work, based on
   experimentally observed vibrational energy levels of the X-2 Sigma(+),
   A(2)Pi, and B-2 Sigma(+) electronic states of CO+, the potential energy
   curves are improved and constructed using a modified Morse (MMorse)
   potential function, then the vibrational energy levels and spectroscopic
   constants are extracted. In the meantime, the internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method with Davison
   size-extensivity correction (+Q) is used to calculate the potential
   energy curves and transition dipole moments. The refined MMorse
   potential shows excellent agreement with the computed potential energy
   curves, while the spectroscopic constants and vibrational levels
   indicate strong consistency with existing theoretical and experimental
   data. The opacities of the CO+ molecule is computed at different
   temperatures under the pressure of 100 atm. The result shows that as
   temperature rises, the opacities of transitions in the long-wavelength
   range increases because of the larger population on excited electronic
   states at higher temperatures. All the data presented in this paper are
   openly available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00213.00136.},
