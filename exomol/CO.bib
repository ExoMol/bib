Title = {{Spectral Study of A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+) Transitions of CO Relevant to

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{859}},
pages ={19},
Abstract = {{Highly correlated ab initio calculations were performed for an accurate
   determination of the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+) system of the CO molecule. A
   highly accurate multi-reference configuration interaction approach was
   used to investigate the potential energy curves (PECs) and the
   transition dipole moment curve (TDMC). The resultant PECs and TDMC found
   by using the aug-cc-pV5Z (aV5Z) basis set and 5330 active spaces are in
   good agreement with the experimental. data. Moreover, the Einstein A
   coefficients, lifetimes, ro-vibrational intensities, absorption
   oscillator strengths, and integrated cross sections are calculated so
   that the vibrational bands include v `'- 0-39 -> v `- 0-23. For
   applications in the atmosphere and interstellar clouds, we studied the
   transition lineshapes to Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles at different
   temperatures and pressures. The intensities were calculated at high
   temperature that was used to satisfy some astrophysical applications,
   such as in planetary atmospheres. The results are potentially useful for
   important SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System and databases such as
   HITRAN, HITEMP, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   Because the results from many laboratory techniques and our calculations
   now agree, analyses of interstellar CO based on absorption from
   A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+) are no longer hindered by present spectral
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {Aims. Astronomical observations of (sub) millimeter wavelength pure
   rotational emission lines of the second most abundant molecule in the
   Universe, CO, hold the promise of probing regions of high temperature
   and density in the innermost parts of circumstellar envelopes.
   Methods. The rotational spectrum of vibrationally excited CO up to
   upsilon = 3 has been measured in the laboratory between 220 and 1940 GHz
   with relative accuracies up to 5.2 x 10(-9), corresponding to similar to
   5 kHz near 1 THz.
   Results. The rotational constant B and the quartic distortion parameter
   D have been determined with high accuracy and even the sextic distortion
   term H was determined quite well for upsilon = 1 while reasonable
   estimates of H were obtained for upsilon = 2 and 3.
   Conclusions. The present data set allows for the prediction of accurate
   rest frequencies of vibrationally excited CO well beyond 2 THz.},

Title = {Validation of CO 4th positive radiation for Mars entry},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {91-104},
Abstract = {This paper presents measurements and simulations of CO 4th Positive
   equilibrium radiation obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's
   Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at
   measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant
   to high-speed entry into a simulated Martian atmosphere (96\% CO2: 4\%
   N-2). The facility was configured to target several ranges of nominal
   Mars entry conditions, of which 7.35 km/s at 0.1 Torr (13.3 Pa), 6.2-8
   km/s at 0.25 Torr (33 Pa) and 7.1-7.8 km/s at 1 Torr (133 Pa) are
   examined in this paper. The CO 4th Positive system was chosen to be the
   focus of this study as it accounts for a large percentage of the emitted
   radiation for Martian entry, and also due to the difficulties of
   obtaining experimental validation data due to the emission appearing in
   the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) spectral range. The focus of this paper is
   to provide a comprehensive comparison between the EAST data and various
   CO 4th Positive databases available in the literature. The analysis
   endeavors to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty in the
   measurements and quantifies the level of agreement found between
   simulations and experimental data. The results of the analysis show that
   the magnitude of the CO 4th Positive radiative intensity is very
   sensitive to the flow temperature. Subsequently, simulations using
   thermodynamic equilibrium generally under-predict the experimental data
   by approximately a factor of up to 2. However, when simulations are
   performed using a flow temperature extracted from the black body limited
   portion of the CO 4th Positive spectra taken from experiment, the
   agreement between the EAST data and simulations is generally very good.
   Furthermore, comparisons of experimental data and simulations across
   other spectral regions provide additional support for the use of the
   black body temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

After detailed rotational analysis of the bands, experimental rovibronic term values of the A 1 Pi ( v = 9 -14) levels were determined for the first time. Individual and equilibrium molecular constants of the A 1 Pi state as well as the Franck-Condon factors were determined for the analysed bands. Moreover, a region of analysed perturbations of the A 1 Pi ( v = 7 -14) levels was extended to the J  30 rotational levels.

Abstract = {{Extensive rovibrational line lists were computed for nine isotopologues

   <= 41, Delta v <= 11, and J <= 150. The line intensity and position
   calculations were carried out using a newly determined piecewise dipole
   moment function (DMF) in conjunction with the wavefunctions calculated
   from an experimentally determined potential energy function from Coxon
   \& Hajigeorgiou. A direct-fit method that simultaneously fits all the
   reliable experimental rovibrational matrix elements has been used to
   construct the dipole moment function near equilibrium internuclear
   distance. In order to extend the amount and quality of input
   experimental parameters, new Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy experiments
   were carried out to enable measurements of the lines in the 4-0 band
   with low uncertainty as well as the first measurements of lines in the
   6-0 band. A new high-level ab initio DMF, derived from a finite field
   approach has been calculated to cover internuclear distances far from
   equilibrium. Accurate partition sums have been derived for temperatures
   up to 9000 K. In addition to air-and self-induced broadening and shift
   parameters, those induced by CO2 and H-2 are now provided for planetary
   applications. A complete set of broadening and shift parameters was
   calculated based on sophisticated extrapolation of high-quality measured
   data. The line lists, which follow HITRAN formalism, are provided as
