Abstract = {Our knowledge of astronomical environments containing CO depends on
   accurate molecular data to reproduce and interpret observations. The
   constant improvement in UV space instrumentation, both in sensitivity
   and resolution, requires increasingly detailed laboratory data.
   Following a long-term experimental campaign at the SOLEIL Synchrotron
   facility, we have acquired complete datasets on the CO isotopologues in
   the vacuum ultraviolet. Absorption spectra were recorded using the
   Fourier-transform spectrometer installed on the DESIRS beamline,
   providing a resolving power R > 10(6) in the 8-12 eV range. Such
   resolution allows the analysis of individual line positions and
   strengths in electronic transitions and the location of perturbations.
   We continue our previous work on A-X bands of (CO)-C-12-O-16 and
   (CO)-C-13-O-16, reporting here measurements for the (CO)-C-13-O-18
   isotopologue. Gas column densities in the differentially-pumped system
   were calibrated using the B-1 Sigma(+)-X-1 Sigma+(v' = 0, v `' = 0)
   band. Absorption bands are analyzed by synthesizing line and band
   profiles and fitting them to measured spectra. New results for A(1)Pi(v'
   = 0-10)-X-1 Sigma(+)(v `' = 0) bands include precise line assignments,
   term values, band-integrated oscillator strengths as well as individual
   ro-vibrational oscillator strengths and Honl-London corrections. For (v'
   = 1) our results are compared with earlier studies. The interpretation
   of mixed perturbing bands, complementing an earlier study, is also
   presented as well as precise line assignments and term values for the
   B-1 Sigma(+)-X-1 Sigma(+)(0-0) band calibrator, and the nearby B-X (1-0)
   and C-1 Sigma(+)-X-1 Sigma(+)(0-0) bands.},

Abstract = {A VUV absorption spectroscopy facility designed for ultra-high spectral
   resolution is in operation as a dedicated branch on the DESIRS beamline

   4 to 30 eV, with an ultimate line width of 0.08 cm(-1) on a large
   spectral window, Delta E/E = 7\%, over which all spectral features can
   be acquired in a multiplex way. The performance can be considered to be
   a middle ground between broadband moderateresolution spectrometers based
   on gratings and ultra-high-spectral-resolution VUV tunable-laser-based
   techniques over very narrow spectral windows. The various available
   gaseous-sample-handling setups, which function over a wide range of
   pressures and temperatures, and the acquisition methodology are
   described. A selection of experimental results illustrates the
   performance and limitations of the FTS-based facility.},

Abstract = {The oscillator strengths of CO, especially for the excitations to the
   predissociating levels C-1 Sigma(+) and E-1 Pi, have significant
   applications in the studies of interstellar gases. A large number of
   investigations, applying a variety of experimental and calculational
   methods, have focused on the determination of these oscillator
   strengths. However, deviations of more than 10\% have been observed,
   even for the same experimental method. In this case, we introduce a new
   technique, the dipole (gamma,gamma), to measure the oscillator
   strengths. The obtained oscillator strengths of the strong bands C-1
   Sigma(+)(v' = 0)-X-1 Sigma(+) and E1 Pi( v' = 0)-X-1 Sigma(+) in this
   work reach high accuracy and are in excellent agreement with some
   previous results, although they are different from the recommended
   values in other works. In addition, we measured the oscillator strengths
   of the A(1)Pi(v' = 0-6)-X-1 Sigma(+) bands, and the electronic
   transition moment dependence on r-centroid was derived.},

Abstract = {The 1-v `' progression of the Angstrom band system, so far unobserved in
   the rare (CO)-C-13-O-17 isotopologue, was obtained under high resolution
   as an emission spectrum using a high accuracy dispersive optical
   spectroscopy. In the studied region 22 700-24 500 cm(-1), 146 spectral
   lines were observed, among which 118 were interpreted as belonging to
   the 1-0 and 1-1 bands of B-A system, and the next 28 were interpreted as
   extra lines belonging to the 1-1 band of B-1 Sigma(+)-e(3)Sigma(-)
   intercombination system, also unobserved in the 13070 molecule so far.
   All those lines were precisely measured with an estimated accuracy
   better than 0.0025 cm(-1), and rotationally analyzed. As a result the
   following in the (CO)-C-13-O-17 molecule were calculated for the first

   turning points, Franck-Condon factors (FCF), relative intensities, and r

   the rotational line width and the instrumental width. Saturation effects
   are reduced by pressure broadening the absorption lines using up to 1.5

Title = {Validation of CO 4th positive radiation for Mars entry},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {121},
Pages = {91-104},
Abstract = {This paper presents measurements and simulations of CO 4th Positive
   equilibrium radiation obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's
   Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at
   measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant
   to high-speed entry into a simulated Martian atmosphere (96\% CO2: 4\%
   N-2). The facility was configured to target several ranges of nominal
   Mars entry conditions, of which 7.35 km/s at 0.1 Torr (13.3 Pa), 6.2-8
   km/s at 0.25 Torr (33 Pa) and 7.1-7.8 km/s at 1 Torr (133 Pa) are
   examined in this paper. The CO 4th Positive system was chosen to be the
   focus of this study as it accounts for a large percentage of the emitted
   radiation for Martian entry, and also due to the difficulties of
   obtaining experimental validation data due to the emission appearing in
   the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) spectral range. The focus of this paper is
   to provide a comprehensive comparison between the EAST data and various
   CO 4th Positive databases available in the literature. The analysis
   endeavors to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty in the
   measurements and quantifies the level of agreement found between
   simulations and experimental data. The results of the analysis show that
   the magnitude of the CO 4th Positive radiative intensity is very
   sensitive to the flow temperature. Subsequently, simulations using
   thermodynamic equilibrium generally under-predict the experimental data
   by approximately a factor of up to 2. However, when simulations are
   performed using a flow temperature extracted from the black body limited
   portion of the CO 4th Positive spectra taken from experiment, the
   agreement between the EAST data and simulations is generally very good.
   Furthermore, comparisons of experimental data and simulations across
   other spectral regions provide additional support for the use of the
   black body temperature.},

Abstract = {Context. We re-analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the
   atmospheres of the two bright K giants Arcturus (a Boo) and Aldebaran (a
   Tau).
   Aims. These stars are in the evolutionary stage following the first
   dredge-up (FDU). Previous determinations (dating back more than 20
   years) of their O-16/O-18 ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU
   expectations; however, the estimated O-16/O-17 and C-12/C-13 ratios were
   lower than in the canonical predictions for red giants. Today these
   anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of non-convective
   mixing episodes. We therefore re-investigated this problem to verify
   whether the observed data can be reproduced in this scenario and if the
   fairly well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing
   the uncertain parameters that characterize non-convective mixing and in
   constraining its physical nature.
   Methods. We used high-resolution infrared spectra from the literature to
   derive the C-12/C-13 and O-16/O-17/O-18 ratios from CO molecular lines
   near 5 mu m, using the local termodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectral
   synthesis method. We made use of the recently published ACE-FTS atlas of
   the infrared solar spectrum for constructing an updated atomic and
   molecular line lists in this spectral range. We also reconsidered the
   determination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric
   and evolutionary models.
   Results. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the two
   stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This
   reinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in
   these stars. By reproducing the observed elemental and isotopic
   abundances with the help of parametric models for the coupled occurrence
   of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived constraints on the
   properties of non-convective mixing, providing information on the so far
   elusive physics of these phenomena. We find that very slow mixing, like
   that associated to diffusive processes, is incapable of explaining the
   observed data, which require a fast transport. Circulation mechanisms
   with speeds intermediate between those typical of diffusive and
   convective mixing are necessary. We conclude with a word of caution on
   the conclusions possible at this stage however, as the parameters for
   the mass transport are fairly sensitive to the stellar mass and initial
   composition. At least for a Boo, reducing the uncertainty still
   remaining on these data would be highly desirable.},

Abstract = {Aims. Astronomical observations of (sub) millimeter wavelength pure
   rotational emission lines of the second most abundant molecule in the
   Universe, CO, hold the promise of probing regions of high temperature

   Methods. The rotational spectrum of vibrationally excited CO up to
   upsilon = 3 has been measured in the laboratory between 220 and 1940 GHz
   with relative accuracies up to 5.2 x 10(-9), corresponding to similar to
   5 kHz near 1 THz.
   Results. The rotational constant B and the quartic distortion parameter
   D have been determined with high accuracy and even the sextic distortion
   term H was determined quite well for upsilon = 1 while reasonable
   estimates of H were obtained for upsilon = 2 and 3.
   Conclusions. The present data set allows for the prediction of accurate
   rest frequencies of vibrationally excited CO well beyond 2 THz.},

Abstract = {A collection of 21 559 highly precise spectroscopic line positions from

   (1980)] and that obtained by Herman and Ogilvie {[}Adv. Chem. Phys 103,
   187 (1998)]. Fully analytical models are used for the various functions,
   including the Born-Oppenheimer internuclear potential function, and an
   account is taken of breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The
   resulting representations are more compact than currently available
   traditional U-kl/Delta(kl) extended Dunham descriptions, and they
   generate quantum-mechanical eigenvalues that reproduce reliably the
   spectroscopic line positions to within the associated measurement
   uncertainties. Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory has been used to
   calculate highly accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion
   constants B-upsilon-O-upsilon for nine isotopomers of carbon monoxide.
   These constants are just as successful at reconstructing the observed
   spectroscopic information as the quantum-mechanical eigenvalues of the
