Abstract = {We demonstrate Doppler broadening thermometry (DBT) with
   all-frequency-domain measurements. Using the R(10) transition of CO at
   1567 nm in a high-finesse optical cavity (mode width 0.6 kHz), we
   resolve Doppler profiles with high signal-to-noise ratios across 2-17 Pa
   pressures. A global Voigt-profile analysis yields temperatures deviating
   by only-2.0 + 3.6 mK from calibrated thermometers, with systematic
   errors suppressed below 9 ppm. The results show negligible dependence on
   line-shape models when accounting for pressure effects, resolving a
   long-standing challenge in DBT. This approach establishes a new paradigm
   for quantum-based thermometry and provides a precision platform for
   testing molecular collision physics.},

Abstract = {The internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC)

   ic-MRCCSD(T)\{4\} approach, perturbatively accounting for contributions
   of triple excitation cluster amplitudes with up to four active indices,
   results in ab initio vibrational term values with a maximum deviation
   from their experimental counterparts not exceeding 10-15 cm(-1) for v is
   an element of {[}0, 41]. The respective DMF obtained by the present
   ic-MRCC calculation agrees within +/- 0.005 D with its most accurate
   theoretical and semi-empirical counterparts in the interval R is an
   element of {[}0.8, 1.5]A, but systematically diverges for R > 1.8A up to
   0.1 D. It highlights the necessity for the revised intensity
   measurements between high-lying (v > 7) vibrational levels of the CO
   ground state since the observed discrepancy is unlikely to be attributed
   to the lack of higher excitations in the cluster expansion or the
   incompleteness of basis sets employed. The ic-MRCC method can be
   recommended for highly accurate calculations of electronic structure and
   properties of other small atmospheric molecules.},

Title = {{Disentangling disc and atmospheric signatures of young brown dwarfs with
   JWST/NIRSpec}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {703},
Abstract = {Context. Young brown dwarfs serve as analogues of giant planets and
   provide benchmarks for atmospheric and formation models. JWST has
   enabled access to near-infrared spectra of brown dwarfs with
   unprecedented sensitivity.
   Aims. We aim to constrain the chemical compositions, temperature
   structures, isotopic ratios, properties of the continuum and line
   emission from their circumstellar discs.
   Methods. We performed atmospheric retrievals and disc modelling on
   JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution (R similar to 2700) spectra covering
   0.97-5.27 mu m. Our approach combines radiative transfer, line-by-line
   opacities, parametrised temperature profiles, and flexible equilibrium
   chemistry for the atmospheres. We also included a ring component from
   the disc, with blackbody continuum and optically thin CO slab emission.
   Results. We detected and constrained more than twenty molecular and
   atomic species in the atmospheres, including (CO)-C-12, H2O, CO2, SiO,
   and several hydrides. The CO fundamental band at 4.6 mu m enables
   detections of (CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-18. We report isotope ratios of
   carbon: C-12/C-13 = 79(-11)(+14) (TWA 27A) and 75(-2)(+2) (TWA 28), and
   oxygen: O-16/O-18 = 645(-70)(+80) (TWA 27A) and 681(-50)(+53) (TWA 28)
   based on water isotopologues. Both objects show significant excess
   infrared emission, which we modelled as warm (approximate to 650 K)
   blackbody rings. We identified optically thin CO emission from hot gas
   (>= 1600 K) in the discs, necessary to reproduce the redder part of the
   spectra. The atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios are 0.54 +/- 0.02 (TWA
   27A) and 0.59 +/- 0.02 (TWA 28), consistent with solar values.
   Conclusions. We characterised the atmospheres and discs of two young
   brown dwarfs through simultaneous constraints on temperature,
   composition, isotope ratios, and disc properties. These observations
   demonstrate the ability of JWST/NIRSpec to study young objects, enabling
   future studies of circumplanetary discs.},

abstract = {Accurate interpretation of carbon monoxide (CO) spectral signatures is essential for designing thermal protection systems during Martian atmospheric entry, necessitating a thorough understanding of CO radiative properties at high temperatures. In this work, the spectral radiative properties of CO were investigated under both the local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and non-local thermal equilibrium (NLTE) conditions across a temperature range of 5–15,000 K, based on ab initio calculations. Potential energy curves and dipole moments for multiple electronic states were computed using the icMRCI+Q method with the aug-cc-pCV5Z-DK basis set, enabling the calculation of partition functions, absorption/emission line intensities, and cross-sections. The results indicate that the X1Σ+– X1Σ+ transition dominates the infrared waveband, the e3Σ− – a3Π, d3Δ – a3Π, and a’(Du et al., 20233)Σ+– a3Π transitions exhibit high radiative intensities in the visible waveband, and the A1Π – X1Σ+, B1Σ+ − X1Σ+, and b3Σ+– a3Π transitions are dominant in the ultraviolet waveband under the LTE. More importantly, under specific NLTE conditions, CO absorption and emission cross sections exhibit enhancements of up to several orders of magnitude. Through comparative analysis of different energy-partitioning schemes, electron energy, rather than vibration-rotation coupling energy, was identified as the dominant factor governing the radiative properties under the NLTE. The dataset established in this work provides critical information for the design of thermal protection systems in high-enthalpy hypersonic flows during atmospheric entry.}

   diluted in nitrogen (N-2) from 2000 to 7500 K and 0.07 to 0.84 atm, with
   conditions selected for sensitive inference of N-2-N-2
   vibration-translation (VT) relaxation times ( tau(N2-N2)(VT)) using CO
   as an optically accessible tracer of N-2. Two additional types of
   experiments leveraged argon (Ar) dilution of either 50\% or 91\%; 50\%
   Ar was used to extend the test time, while 91\% Ar was used to access a
   condition at 10 250 K where chemical reactions occur. High-temperature
   experiments probed 24 absorption features covering all vibrational
   states v(n) = 0-12 and many rotational levels from J `' = 2-116, as well
   as weak features from the (CO16)-O-13 isotopologue. Low-lying
   vibrational states follow an expected Boltzmann distribution, although
   states above v `' = 5 are observed to populate faster than expected from
   their Boltzmann populations-both for full N-2 dilution and for 50\% Ar
   dilution. Modal temperatures, inferred from v(n) = 0-5 states, remain in
   good agreement with simulations of the vibrational relaxation processes
   based on literature values of vibrational relaxation times.
   Non-Boltzmann behavior for v(n) > 5 was investigated with a
   state-to-state model, with model predictions improving when multiquantum
   transitions were included in the model. Overall, the inferred values of
   tau(N2-N2)(VT) remain consistent with literature values, although the
   low scatter and uncertainty of the RAST measurements suggest a rate
   approximately 10\% faster than the Millikan and White correlation.},

Abstract = {We present an analysis of CO rovibrational emission lines in the 183

   sample includes a broad range of stellar mass (both T Tauri and Herbig
   Ae/Be) and disk evolutionary states (from full to debris disks). We find
   that 53\% of the sample has CO rovibrational emission lines present in
   their spectrum with disk/stellar subtype detection rates of 82\% for
   transition disks, 61\% for Herbigs, and 77\% for classical T Tauri
   stars. Although there is no discernible difference between T Tauri and
   Herbig Ae/Be star CO detection rates, the detection of accretion and of
   CO are statistically correlated in T Tauri stars but not in Herbig Ae/Be
   objects. Within the sample of T Tauri stars, we find that no weak-line T
   Tauri stars have CO rovibrational emission lines. We use slab modeling
   to analyze the density, temperature, and emitting area of the sample.
   The retrieval results imply that Herbig Ae/Be objects tend to have
   cooler and larger CO emitting regions than T Tauri stars. We find that
   the CO emitting area is not a thin ring as defined by temperature, but a
   ring of varying size, likely dependent on the structure of the disk. We
   also present guidelines on how to approach CO rovibrational emission
   lines in JWST spectra and present methods for linking ground-based
   observations with JWST spectra. This includes line-to-continuum ratio
   estimates based on stellar mass and accretion rate.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (HdC) stars are a class of supergiants with anomalous chemical compositions, suggesting that they are remnants of CO–He white dwarf (WD) mergers. This class comprises two spectroscopically similar subclasses—dusty R Coronae Borealis (RCB) and dustless Hydrogen-deficient Carbon (dLHdC) stars. Both subclasses have a stark overabundance of 18O in their atmospheres, but spectroscopic differences between them remain poorly studied. We present high-resolution (R ≈ 75,000) K-band spectra of six RCB and six dLHdC stars, including four newly discovered dLHdC stars, making this the largest sample to date. We develop a semi-automated fitting routine to measure 16O/18O ratios for this sample, tripling the number of dLHdC stars with oxygen isotope ratios measured from high resolution spectra. All six dLHdC stars have 16O/18O &lt; 1, while the RCB stars have 16O/18O &gt; 4. Additionally, for the first time, we find a trend of decreasing 16O/18O ratios with increasing effective temperature for HdC stars, consistent with predictions of theoretical WD merger models. However, we note that current models overpredict the low 16O/18O ratios of dLHdC stars by two orders of magnitude. We also measure abundances of C, N, O, Fe, S, Si, Mg, Na, and Ca for these stars. We observe a correlation between the abundances of 14N and 18O in our sample, suggesting that a fixed fraction of the 14N is converted to 18O in these stars via α-capture. Our results affirm the emerging picture that the mass ratio/total mass of the WD binary determine whether an RCB or dLHdC is formed post-merger.}

Previous techniques have often been intricate, especially when dealing with a task of comb-mode hopping. In contrast, our method simplifies the mode-hoping method by tuning the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) at a rate of frep/2, while keeping the diode current locked to a fixed-frequency local oscillator (LO) at frep/4. This approach provides a reasonable sampling interval suitable for spectroscopic measurements of gas lines, typically spanning a few gigahertz. Our demonstration effectively improved the noise level of the ringdown traces in cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS), even when using a passively stabilized optical cavity. Additionally, we report the line strength of the 12C16O R23 line, yielding results that closely align with previous research studies.},

  abstract = {Carbon monoxide (CO) emission has been observed in a number of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and is known to be an important coolant at late times. We have implemented a chemical reaction network in the radiative-transfer code cmfgen to investigate the formation of CO and its impact on SN ejecta. We calculate two 1D SN models with and without CO: a BSG explosion model at one nebular epoch and a full time sequence (50 to 300 days) for a RSG explosion. In both models, CO forms at nebular times in the dense, inner regions at velocities \\&lt;2000 km s−1 where line emission from CO can dominate the cooling and reduce the local temperature by as much as a factor of two, weakening emission lines and causing the optical light curve to fade faster. That energy is instead emitted in CO bands, primarily the fundamental band at ∼4.5μm, which accounts for up to 20\\% of the total luminosity at late times. However, the non-monotonic nature of the CO cooling function can cause numerical difficulties and introduce multiple temperature solutions. This issue is compounded by the sensitivity of the CO abundance to a few reaction rates, many of which have large uncertainties or disparate values across literature sources. Our results also suggest that, in many SNe, CO level populations are far from their LTE values. Unfortunately, accurate collisional data, necessary to compute NLTE populations, are limited to a few transitions.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of high-supersonic aircraft, non-contact
   diagnosis technology, etc,more molecular bands are excited, and the
   demand for rovibrational spectrum data under high temperature and high
   pressure has increased dramatically. In addition, with the rapid
   improvement of the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), and the tunable
   semiconductor laser absorption spectrum technology (TDLAS) with high
   sensitivity, the research on the corresponding spectrum are promoted
   further accordingly. CO, an important product of high-temperature
   combustion, is the first to be investigated. In this paper, firstly, the
   local discrete potential energy points near the molecular equilibrium
   internuclear separation were obtained employing the Rydberg-Klein-Rees
   (RKR) method, with the use of spectral parameters of the (CO)-C-12-O-16
   on the ground state (vibrational quantum number nu<41) determined by the
   experimental. Then it is fitted to more than ten common analytical
   potential functions, and it is shown that the SPF and Morse functions
   have good fitting accuracy, but they are still unreasonable on the
   long-range part. Because of this, the dissociation energy from the
   experiment is adopted for revising the long-range part, and a new,
   semi-empirical, global potential function named Revised-Morse was
   constructed, which not only could accurately reproduce the known
   vibrational levels but reasonably predict the unknown high vibrational
   levels with accurate dissociation limit. The multi-reference
   configuration interaction method (MRCI) was used confirmed its
   rationality. The levels with high nu calculated in this paper agree with
   the result from the literature. Secondly, the electronic dipole moment
   surfaces (DMs) of (CO)-C-12-O-16 on the ground state at vibrational
   quantum number nu<63 under three kinds of electric fields were obtained
   using the multi-reference averaged coupled-pair functional (ACPF) theory
   combined with differential technology. Based on the above Revised-Morse
   potential function and DMs, the vibrational and transition levels up to
   the dissociation limit, and the transition moment, line strength,
   Einstein coefficient and intensity at room temperature with nu<63 were
   obtained by solving the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, meanwhile,
   the spectral constants such as radiation lifetime and centrifugal
   distortion were also obtained. The calculated values are almost
   completely consistent with the results from the HITRAN. This paper not
   only reproduces the known spectral bands perfectly but also predicts
   hundreds of thousands of new spectral lines and some new spectral
   parameters, which can provide a reference for spectral detection. To
   establish the temperature measurement model based on (CO)-C-12-O-16, the
   partition function of temperature below 9 000 K was further
   investigated, and the rovibrational spectra at different temperatures
   were simulated. The variation of the spectral line with temperature was
   illustrated by the line spectrogram below 20 000 cm(-1) (logarithmic
   coordinate) and nu(0-1) band (linear coordinate). Several possible
   temperature measurement model schemes are proposed. Finally, the
   influence of pressure on the rovibrational line is discussed.},

   routinely to generate the multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces
   (mD-PESs) of van der Waals complexes of small molecular systems relevant
   for atmospheric, astrophysical and industrial applications. Although
   very accurate, this method is computationally prohibitive for medium and
   large molecules containing clusters. For instance, the recent detections
   of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium, such as
   benzonitrile, revealed the need to establish an accurate enough
   electronic structure approach to map the mD-PESs of these species
   interacting with the surrounding gases. As a benchmark, we have treated
   the case of the polar molecule benzonitrile interacting with helium,
   where we use post-Hartree-Fock and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory
   (SAPT) techniques. Accordingly, we show that MP2 and
   distinguishable-cluster approximation (DCSD) cannot be used for this
   purpose, whereas accurate enough PESs may be obtained using the
   corresponding explicitly correlated versions (MP2-F12 or DCSD-F12) with
   a reduction in computational costs. Alternatively, computations revealed
   that SAPT(DFT) is as performant as CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ, making it
   the method of choice for mapping the mD-PESs of COMs containing
   clusters. Therefore, we have used this approach to generate the 3D-PES
   of the benzonitrile-He complex along the intermonomer Jacobi
   coordinates. As an application, we have incorporated the analytic form
   of this PES into quantum dynamical computations to determine the cross
   sections of the rotational (de-)excitation of benzonitrile colliding
   with helium at a collision energy of 10 cm-1.
   We establish an accurate methodology for the generation of mD-PESs of
   medium sized and large molecules containing van der Waals complexes. We

Emission from atomic carbon C I was predominant at 10−7 Torr, while molecular C2 Swan Band emission was observed at 10−7 Torr, at all air pressures, as well as in pure oxygen. Emission from the CN violet bands was observed only when ablating in air, but not in vacuum or pure O2, indicating that CN was the product of a chemical reaction between an ablated carbon species and N2 present in air, and not intrinsically present in the C–C composite targets. High-resolution emission spectra from C2 and CN were measured and fitted to vibrational and rotational temperatures. Time-resolved emission measurements of both these molecules were used to estimate their respective velocities as a function of pressure. No emission from excited state CO could be detected from 180–900 nm, even in pure O2. However, neutral and ground state CO and CO2 were both detected by measuring FTIR absorption spectra following the ablation of a composite target at 248 nm, in dry air at atmospheric pressure.

The most general requirement to fulfill is that they must obey all known theoretical restrictions. Recently, the first steps in this direction were made by constructing, for carbon monoxide, a semi-empirical fully analytical mass-corrected potential-energy function (PEF) [Meshkov et al. JQSRT, 2018, 217, 262] and a mass-independent dipole-moment function (DMF), Medvedev21 and [Meshkov et al., JQSRT, 2022, 280, 108090], with correct behavior in the limits of small and large inter-atomic separations. Both the PEF and DMF were fitted not only to the experimental line positions and transition moments but also to their ab initio values. A few additional requirements to the DMF were formulated, including the straight NIDL of [Medvedev, J. Chem. Phys., 2012, 137, 174307] and stability of predictions with respect to variations of the model DMF parameters caused by variations of the database to which the model was fitted. In this paper, the irregular DMF with branch points proposed in Medvedev21 is modified by increasing the rate of reaching the long-range limit and also by decreasing the number of adjustable parameters. In order to ensure the reliability of the predictions, a few regular model DMFs with no singularities in any finite part of the complex plane and a rational DMF are considered for the purpose of comparison. The idea behind such an approach is that similar intensity predictions of the DMFs with cardinally different analytical properties will testify the validity of the results obtained and will provide for a rough estimate of the prediction errors. The line lists for all CO isotopologues are generated in the range of quantum numbers v′=1-41, Δv≤15,J≤150 (J≤200 for 0-0 and 1-0 bands). The validity of the calculated intensities up to Δv=15 is demonstrated. Estimates of the expected errors of the calculated line intensities in the 7-0 band are given.}

   can be used to generate transition lines with sufficient accuracy, as
   evident from the high J of agreement with the HITRAN database, Velichko

   intensities, absorption oscillator strengths and Einstein A coefficients
   of these lines, which are introduced to enhance the dataset and are in

   spectral-resolution observations obtained with the CRIRES+ spectrograph
   at the Very Large Telescope. We measure an atmospheric carbon isotope
   ratio (12C/13C) of 97(-18)(+33), which is consistent with the value of
   89 found in the local interstellar medium6, but differs from the ratio
   of 65 observed in Jupiter7 and Saturn8. The oxygen isotope ratio
   (16O/18O) is weakly constrained to be >50 (3 sigma). The measured carbon

  abstract = {A VUV absorption spectroscopy facility designed for ultra-high spectral
   resolution is in operation as a dedicated branch on the DESIRS beamline
   at Synchrotron SOLEIL. This branch includes a unique VUV Fourier
   transform spectrometer (FTS) and a dedicated versatile gas sample
   chamber. The FTS instrument can cover a large UV-VUV spectral range from
   4 to 30 eV, with an ultimate line width of 0.08 cm(-1) on a large
   spectral window, Delta E/E = 7\%, over which all spectral features can
   be acquired in a multiplex way. The performance can be considered to be
   a middle ground between broadband moderateresolution spectrometers based
   on gratings and ultra-high-spectral-resolution VUV tunable-laser-based
   techniques over very narrow spectral windows. The various available
   gaseous-sample-handling setups, which function over a wide range of
   pressures and temperatures, and the acquisition methodology are
   described. A selection of experimental results illustrates the

calculated from an experimentally determined potential energy function from Coxon & Hajigeorgiou.
A direct-fit method that simultaneously fits all the reliable experimental rovibrational
matrix elements has been used to construct the dipole moment function near equilibrium
internuclear distance. In order to extend the amount and quality of input experimental
parameters, new Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy experiments were carried out to enable
measurements of the lines in the 4-0 band with low uncertainty as well as the first
measurements of lines in the 6-0 band. A new high-level ab initio DMF, derived from
a finite field approach has been calculated to cover internuclear distances far from
equilibrium. Accurate partition sums have been derived for temperatures up to 9000Â K.
In addition to air- and self-induced broadening and shift parameters, those induced
by CO2 and H2 are now provided for planetary applications. A complete set of broadening

  pages = {189-196},
  abstract = {The CO (2-1) and (1-0) dayglow at 4.7Î¼m was observed on Mars at the
peak of northern summer (LS=110Â°) using the CSHELL spectrograph at NASA IRTF.
There are six (2-1) and two (1-0) emission lines in the observed spectra. They
are contaminated by the solar CO lines and some martian and telluric lines. Fitting
by synthetic spectra results in intensities of the dayglow lines and reflectivities
of Mars at 4.7Î¼m. Mean reflectivity at 109Â°W from 50Â°S to 50Â°N is 0.15, similar to
that observed by Mariner 6 and 7 in four regions on Mars. The CO (1-0) dayglow is
excited by absorption of sunlight at 4.7Î¼m; the emission is optically thick with
a non-LTE line distribution and peaks near 87km. The (1-0) line intensities are
converted to the (1-0) band intensity using the line distribution from Billebaud
et al. (1991). Mean intensity of the CO (1-0) dayglow is 1.7 MR with a weak limb
darkening to 1.3 MR. This dayglow is poorly accessible for diagnostics of the
martian atmosphere. The CO (2-1) dayglow is excited by absorption of the sunlight
by the CO (2-0) band at 2.35Î¼m with minor contributions from photolysis of CO2
and the CO (3-0) band at 1.58Î¼m. The dayglow is quenched by CO2 and peaks at 50km.
Intensities of the observed six (2-1) lines result in rotational temperatures that
should be equal to ambient temperatures at 50km. These temperatures are retrieved
from 50Â°S to 90Â°N and vary in the range of 140â€“170K with a mean value of 153K. The
observed intensities of the CO (2-1) dayglow are corrected for airmass and the
surface reflection and give vertical intensities that are equal to 2.1 MR at 20Â°N
to 50Â°N decreasing to 1.5 MR at 90Â°N and 1 MR at 45Â°S. The dayglow intensities
depend on CO mixing ratio at 50km and solar zenith angle. Retrieved CO mixing
ratios at 50km gradually increase from 1100ppm at 40Â°S to 1600ppm at 70Â°N. This
behavior is very different from that observed in the lowest scale height at the
same season with increase to southern polar regions because of condensation of
CO2 near the south pole (Krasnopolsky, V.A. [2003]. Icarus 165, 315â€“325). The
difference reflects complicated dynamic processes in the atmosphere. This is the
first observation of CO in the middle atmosphere of Mars, and the observed behavior
of CO should be further studied in both observation and theory. The CO (2-1) dayglow
is a tool for remote sensing of temperature and CO at 50km on Mars using ground-based
and spacecraft instruments. The observed CO and temperatures may be used to test
photochemical GCMs for Mars.},

  abstract = {This paper presents measurements and simulations of CO 4th Positive
   equilibrium radiation obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's
   Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at
   measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant
   to high-speed entry into a simulated Martian atmosphere (96\% CO2: 4\%
   N-2). The facility was configured to target several ranges of nominal
   Mars entry conditions, of which 7.35 km/s at 0.1 Torr (13.3 Pa), 6.2-8
   km/s at 0.25 Torr (33 Pa) and 7.1-7.8 km/s at 1 Torr (133 Pa) are
   examined in this paper. The CO 4th Positive system was chosen to be the
   focus of this study as it accounts for a large percentage of the emitted
   radiation for Martian entry, and also due to the difficulties of
   obtaining experimental validation data due to the emission appearing in
   the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) spectral range. The focus of this paper is
   to provide a comprehensive comparison between the EAST data and various
   CO 4th Positive databases available in the literature. The analysis
   endeavors to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty in the
   measurements and quantifies the level of agreement found between

   sensitive to the flow temperature. Subsequently, simulations using
   thermodynamic equilibrium generally under-predict the experimental data

   performed using a flow temperature extracted from the black body limited
   portion of the CO 4th Positive spectra taken from experiment, the
   agreement between the EAST data and simulations is generally very good.
   Furthermore, comparisons of experimental data and simulations across
   other spectral regions provide additional support for the use of the
   black body temperature.},

   the parameters for non-convective mixing on the red giant branch}},
  journal = AA,
  year = {2012},
  volume = {548},
  pages = {A55},
  abstract = {Context. We re-analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the
   atmospheres of the two bright K giants Arcturus (a Boo) and Aldebaran (a
   Tau).
   Aims. These stars are in the evolutionary stage following the first
   dredge-up (FDU). Previous determinations (dating back more than 20
   years) of their O-16/O-18 ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU
   expectations; however, the estimated O-16/O-17 and C-12/C-13 ratios were
   lower than in the canonical predictions for red giants. Today these
   anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of non-convective
   mixing episodes. We therefore re-investigated this problem to verify
   whether the observed data can be reproduced in this scenario and if the
   fairly well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing
   the uncertain parameters that characterize non-convective mixing and in
   constraining its physical nature.
   Methods. We used high-resolution infrared spectra from the literature to
   derive the C-12/C-13 and O-16/O-17/O-18 ratios from CO molecular lines
   near 5 mu m, using the local termodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectral
   synthesis method. We made use of the recently published ACE-FTS atlas of
   the infrared solar spectrum for constructing an updated atomic and
   molecular line lists in this spectral range. We also reconsidered the
   determination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric
   and evolutionary models.
   Results. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the two
   stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This
   reinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in
   these stars. By reproducing the observed elemental and isotopic
   abundances with the help of parametric models for the coupled occurrence
   of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived constraints on the
   properties of non-convective mixing, providing information on the so far
   elusive physics of these phenomena. We find that very slow mixing, like
   that associated to diffusive processes, is incapable of explaining the
   observed data, which require a fast transport. Circulation mechanisms
   with speeds intermediate between those typical of diffusive and
   convective mixing are necessary. We conclude with a word of caution on
   the conclusions possible at this stage however, as the parameters for
   the mass transport are fairly sensitive to the stellar mass and initial
   composition. At least for a Boo, reducing the uncertainty still
   remaining on these data would be highly desirable.},

for carbon monoxide (CO) in many astrophysical environments, ranging from interstellar
clouds to protoplanetary disks. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding
of the depth dependence and isotope-selective nature of this process.
Methods. We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic data
from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and isotope-selective
photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous work. The model includes
self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by atomic and molecular hydrogen, and
it is the first such model to include the rare isotopologues C17O and 13C17O. We couple
it to a simple chemical network to analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent
clouds, photon-dominated regions, and circumstellar disks.
Results. The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar radiation
field is 2.6 10-10 s-1, 30% higher than currently adopted values. Increasing the
excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the photodissociation rates
and the isotopic selectivity by as much as a factor of three for temperatures above
100 K. The model reproduces column densities observed towards diffuse clouds and
PDRs, and it offers an explanation for both the enhanced and the reduced N(12CO)/N(13CO)
ratios seen in diffuse clouds. The photodissociation of C17O and 13C17O shows almost
exactly the same depth dependence as that of C18O and 13C18O, respectively, so 17O
and 18O are equally fractionated with respect to 16O. This supports the recent
hypothesis that CO photodissociation in the solar nebula is responsible for the
anomalous 17O and 18O abundances in meteorites. Grain growth in circumstellar
disks can enhance the N(12CO)/N(C17O) and N(12CO)/N(C18O) ratios by a factor of
ten relative to the initial isotopic abundances.},

quality: carbon monoxide (CO) from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere
(MOPITT) instrument and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate-Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This paper compares and contrasts these data
sets with a view to understanding the general features of the overall pollutant
loading of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). We present a detailed examination of the
seasonal and recent interannual variability of the fine mode AOD and CO column,
first considering the variation of the global zonal average for both quantities,
and then concentrating on several geographical regions with the aim of isolating
different emissions. In a zonal sense, the principal NH sources are related to
anthropogenic urban and industrial activity. We show that both the CO and the AOD
zonal seasonal variations reflect the atmospheric oxidant concentration, which
determines the primary sink of CO and the production of sulfate aerosol. As a
consequence, the seasonal cycles are several months out of phase, with perturbations
resulting from sporadic wildfire or biomass-burning emissions. In these cases,
carbonaceous particles dominate the AOD, and this results in the best correlation
with the CO column. Of the 4 years of data available from the Terra satellite, the
winter and spring of 2002â€“2003 showed anomalously high NH pollution compared to the
previous years. This was a result of fires in western Russia in the late summer and
fall of 2002 and intense fires in the southeast of Russia in the spring and summer
of 2003. We examine these events using fire counts from MODIS to indicate the burning
regions and investigate how the timing of the fires in relation to atmospheric oxidant
concentrations affects the resultant seasonal pollutant loadings. Finally, we trace

for the first overtone band transitions of 12C16O at room temperature have been

These spectra were recorded using the 1-m Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at
the McMath-Pierce facility of the National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak, Arizona.
Because of the short path length of the sample cell (10.0cm), the volume mixing
ratios of CO in hydrogen were relatively high, âˆ¼18â€“22%, to achieve measurable absorption.
These large volume-mixing ratios necessitated the simultaneous determination of
the CO self-broadening and self-shift coefficients along with the hydrogen-broadening
and hydrogen-induced shift coefficients. We have determined these coefficients
at room temperature, along with line positions and absolute intensities, for the
P(27) through R(27) 12C16O 2-0 transitions by fitting the entire spectral interval
from 4130 to 4345cmâˆ’1 in all nine spectra simultaneously using our multispectrum
nonlinear least-squares procedure. Our intensity measurements are consistently
low (1â€“6%) compared with the HITRAN values but the majority of the intensities
are within 4% of the HITRAN values. The values of self-broadening coefficients
vary from 0.0452 to 0.0862cmâˆ’1atmâˆ’1 at 296K and those of hydrogen-broadening
coefficient range between 0.0475 and 0.0795cmâˆ’1atmâˆ’1 at 296K. All of our measured
self- and hydrogen-shift coefficients are negative and range from âˆ’0.002 to âˆ’0.008cmâˆ’1atmâˆ’1.
With the pressure and path length used in our study we did not find evidence of
significant line mixing in either the self- or hydrogen-broadened spectra. This
study represents the first high-resolution experimental determination of hydrogen-induced
pressure broadening and pressure-shift coefficients in the 2-0 band of 12C16O at

The CO laser heterodyne spectrometer with optional microwave sideband generation
utilizes heterodyne techniques to measure the frequency of a CO laser, which is
locked to saturation signals of CO transitions at low pressure, against combination
frequencies of two saturation-stabilized CO2lasers. Frequencies for ground state

A systematic correction (between âˆ’4 and âˆ’13 kHz) of our earlier published CO sub-Doppler

values. The updated frequencies together with the new measurements exhibit absolute

  abstract = {An extensive work on vibration-rotation spectra in the fundamental 1Î£+
electronic state of CO is reported. More than 30 000 Doppler-limited measurements
corresponding to about 8500 transitions of 255 bands of 12C16O, 12C18O, 13C16O,
and 13C18O, most of them observed for the first time, have been obtained with a
high information Fourier transform interferometer on the sequences Î”v = 1, 2, and 3.
The highest v and J values are 41 and 93, respectively. Experimental vibrational
levels are then well observed up to three fourths of the dissociation energy limit.
These accurate infrared wavenumbers, with an additional selected set of all previous
measurements, have been simultaneously fitted to the Dunham expression in a weighted
nonlinear least-squares calculation covering seven different isotopic species. It
significantly improves both the number of parameters (U and Î”) obtained by the best
previous work (35 instead of 23) and their corresponding standard deviations. The
rms of the fit is equal to 13 Ã— 10âˆ’6 cmâˆ’1 (390 KHz). Calculated wavenumbers from
the 35 reduced Dunham and mass-scaling coefficients can then be used as secondary
standards, even for transitions involving high v and J values of the various isotopic
species. These new parameters should be a convenient and useful tool for several
purposes, such as assignment of infrared laser lines and identification of microwave
and infrared transitions in astronomical spectra. The Dunham coefficients Y are also
reported for 12C16O, 12C17O, 12C18O, 13C16O, 13C17O, 13C18O, and 14C16O. These
experimentally determined accurate Y should also be useful for further examination
of the potential energy and dipole moment formulations.},

  pages = {431-449},
  abstract = {Dipole moment matrix elements have been computed for the five most
abundant isotopes of CO. The wave functions utilized were obtained from a direct
solution of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation with an accurate RKR potential. The dipole
moment function, in the form of a PadÃ© approximant, was chosen to reproduce the
experimental measurements near equilibrium, to have the proper united and separated
atom limits, and to have the correct long-range asymptotic functional dependence
on internuclear separation. Because of the large number of transitions involved,
and to facilitate applications, the squares of the dipole moment matrix elements
were fitted by a least-squares procedure to polynomials in v and J. Predictions
for the 5-0 and 6-0 rotationless matrix elements and Herman-Wallis coefficients
are given, and their dependence on the isotopic reduced mass is discussed. For
the pure rotational band, v = vâ€² = 0, explicit Einstein A values and transition
frequencies were calculated for the three most abundant isotopes for J up to 55.
The corresponding dipole moment matrix elements were also fitted to simple polynomials
in m and the dependence of the coefficients on the reduced mass given. The present
results incorporate the most accurate and extensive intensity measurements and
theoretical dipole moment function data for any heteronuclear diatomic molecule.
In view of this, because of the importance of the CO laser, the accuracy of the
spectral frequencies, and the ubiquity of the CO molecule, it is reasonable to
expect that some of these lines, in particular, in the fundamental band of 12C16O,
can serve as laboratory standards for intensity measurements.},
