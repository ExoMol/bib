Abstract = {{There are currently no suitable methods for sensitive automated in situ
   monitoring of gaseous radiocarbon, one of the main sources of
   radioactive gas emissions from nuclear power plants. Here, we present a
   transportable instrument for in situ airborne radiocarbon detection
   based on mid-infrared cavity ring-down spectroscopy and report its
   performance in a 1-week field measurement at the Loviisa nuclear power
   plant. Radiocarbon is detected by measuring an absorption line of the
   (CO2)-C-14 molecule. The time resolution of the measurements is 45 min,
   significantly less than the few days' resolution of the currently used
   technique, while maintaining a comparable sensitivity. The method can
   also assess the prevalence of radiocarbon in different molecular species
   in the airborne emissions. The optical in situ monitoring presented is a
   completely new method for monitoring emissions from nuclear facilities.}},

Abstract = {{A Bruker IFS 125HR Fourier-transform spectrometer has been used to

   30013-00001, 30014-00001, and 00031-00001. A total of 10 measurements
   with absorption path lengths between 14.6 and 59.4 m and sample
   pressures from 3 to 80 mbar were performed at 295 K. A multispectrum
   fitting approach was used applying the Hartmann-Tran profile extended to
   account for line mixing in the Rosenkranz first order perturbation
   approximation. Line positions, self-shifts, intensities, self-broadened
   widths, their speed dependence and in some cases line mixing were
   adjusted for fitting the measurements. A rigorous error analysis has
   been performed. The primary goal of this work was to investigate whether
   Fourier transform spectroscopy can deliver line intensity accuracy down
   to the 0.1\% level. In this work, a combined systematic standard
   uncertainty of 0.15\% has been achieved, further improvements down to
   the 0.1\% level are feasible. The achieved level of combined standard
   uncertainty has, to our knowledge, not been reached by Fourier-transform
   spectroscopy before. Comparisons with most recent work are presented for
   line positions, line intensities, self-broadening and its speed

abstract = {The recent detections of electric-quadrupole (E2) transitions in water
vapor and magnetic-dipole (M1) transitions in carbon dioxide have opened a new field
in molecular spectroscopy. While in their present status, the spectroscopic databases
provide only electric-dipole (E1) transitions for polyatomic molecules (H2O, CO2, N2O, CH4, O3),
the possible impact of weak E2 and M1 bands to the modeling of the Earth and planetary
atmospheres has to be addressed. This is especially important in the case of carbon
dioxide for which E2 and M1 bands may be located in spectral windows of weak E1
absorption. In the present work, a high sensitivity absorption spectrum of CO2 is
recorded by Optical-Feedback-Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (OFCEAS) in
the 3.3 mum transparency window of carbon dioxide. The studied spectral interval
corresponds to the region where M1 transitions of the nu2+nu3 band of carbon dioxide
were recently identified in the spectrum of the Martian atmosphere. Here, both M1
and E2 transitions of the nu2+nu3 band are detected by OFCEAS. Using recent ab initio
calculations of the E2 spectrum of 12C16O2, intensity measurements of five M1 lines
and three E2 lines allow us to disentangle the M1 and E2 contributions. Indeed, E2
intensity values (on the order of a few 10-29 cm/molecule) are found in reasonable
agreement with ab initio calculations while the intensity of the M1 lines (including
an E2 contribution) agree very well with recent very long path measurements by Fourier
Transform spectroscopy. We thus conclude that both E2 and M1 transitions should be
systematically incorporated in the CO2 line list provided by spectroscopic databases.},

Abstract = {We report on the detection of hot CO2 in the O-rich asymptotic giant

   range 12.8-14.3 mu m carried out with the Echelon-cross-Echelle
   Spectrograph (EXES) mounted on the Stratospheric Observatory for
   Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We found similar or equal to 240 CO2
   emission lines in several vibrational bands. These detections were
   possible thanks to a favorable Doppler shift that allowed us to avoid
   contamination from telluric CO2 features. The highest excitation lines
   involve levels at an energy of similar or equal to 7000 K. The detected
   lines are narrow (average deconvolved width similar or equal to 2.5 km
   s(-1)) and weak (usually less than or similar to 10\% the continuum). A
   ro-vibrational diagram shows that there are three different populations,
   warm, hot, and very hot, with rotational temperatures of similar or
   equal to 550, 1150, and 1600 K, respectively. From this diagram, we
   derived a lower limit for the column density of similar or equal to 2.2
   x 10(16) cm(-2). Further calculations based on a model of the R Leo
   envelope suggest that the total column density can be as large as 7.0 x
   10(17) cm(-2) and the abundance with respect to H-2 similar or equal to
   2.5 x 10(-5). The detected lines are probably formed due to the
   de-excitation of CO2 molecules from high energy vibrational states,
   which are essentially populated by the strong R Leo continuum at 2.7 and
   4.2 mu m.},

Journal = {Optica},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Accurate and spectroscopic measurements of molecular transition
   frequencies are increasingly being employed in a variety of rigorous
   tests of physics, including the validity of quantum electrodynamics, the
   proton-electron mass ratio, and the dipole moment of the electron.
   Near-infrared molecular transitions may also underpin secondary
   frequency standards for length metrology and provide convenient
   wavelength standards for telecommunication and spectroscopy. To report
   progress in this field, we describe measurements of near-infrared
   Doppler-broadened carbon dioxide line positions. Our experiment uses
   cavity ring-down spectroscopy in the linear domain and provides an
   accurate International System of Units (SI)-traceable frequency axis via
   active locking of the probe laser and ring-down cavity to a
   Cs-clock-referenced optical frequency comb. The approach has several key
   attributes: the ability to rapidly scan the probe laser while
   maintaining a phase lock to the optical frequency comb, continuously
   tunable spectrum frequency axes that are not limited by the cavity mode
   spacing, and high signal-to-noise-ratio spectra resulting in stationary
   statistics amenable to long-term averaging. This performance is achieved
   by phase locking a single-mode probe laser to the optical frequency
   comb, coherent electro-optical phase modulation for rapid cavity
   mode-to-mode shifting of the probe laser, and sub-kilohertz-level
   frequency stabilization of the ring-down cavity relative to the probe
   laser. We report vacuum transition frequencies of five transitions in
   the (30012) <- (00001) vibrational band of (CO2)-C-12-O-16 near 1.57 mu

Abstract = {The very weak absorption spectrum of natural CO2 is studied at high
   sensitivity near 1.18 mu m. The investigated region corresponds to a
   transparency window of particular interest for Venus. Low pressure (10
   Torr) spectra are recorded with unprecedented sensitivity in the
   8311-8679 cm(-1) interval. A noise equivalent absorption, alpha(min), on
   the order of 5 x 10(-12) cm(-1) is achieved using a cavity ring down
   spectrometer (CRDS) coupled with a self-referenced frequency comb. 669
   lines are accurately measured and rovibrationnally assigned to 15 bands
   of the three first carbon dioxide isotopologues, (CO2)-C-12-O-16,
   (CO2)-C-13-O-16 and (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-18. For all but one band, line
   intensities are smaller than 10(-28) cm/molecule at 296 K and the
   weakest lines have intensity as low as 5 x 10(-31) cm/molecule. In the
   large 8310-8645 cm(-1) interval where no CO2 absorption lines were
   previously detected, about 500 lines are measured. In spite of the
   weakness of the considered transitions, line centers could be accurately
   determined and spectroscopic parameters are determined from standard
   band-by-band fit of the line positions (typical rms deviations are 5 x
   10(-4) cm(-1)).
   These newly observed bands provide critical validation tests for the
   most recent spectroscopic databases of carbon dioxide. The comparison to
   the recent updated version of the Carbon Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank
   (CDSD2019), to the current HITRAN2016 database and ab initio line lists
   is presented. The CDSD and HITRAN positions deviate from the
   measurements by less than 0.01 cm(-1). Measured line intensities show an
   overall good agreement in particular with ab initio values but reveal
   that a few bands have inaccurate intensities in HITRAN2016 and CDSD2019.
   Three very weak bands are missing in CDSD2019. The reported experimental
   information will help to improve the quality of the CO2 spectroscopic
   databases in the region. },

Abstract = {Quantitative determination of atmospheric CO2 concentration by remote
   sensing relies on accurate line parameters. Lamb dips of the lines up to
   J `' = 72 in the 30013-00001 band at 1605 nm were measured using a
   comb-locked cavity ring-down spectrometer, and the positions were
   determined with an accuracy of a few kHz. A simple effective Hamiltonian
   model can fit the rotational energies in the 30013 state ideally within
   the experimental accuracy, indicating that the vibrational state is
   well-isolated and can be regarded as free from perturbations. From a
   comparison between other bands using a similar analysis, we conclude
   that the transitions in the 30013-00001 band could be more suitable as
   reference lines for sensing applications with the potentially improved
   line parameter accuracy.},

on an unmatched large number of cohort studies in many countries. We find that
fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65\% of the excess mortality rate
attributable to air pollution, and 70\% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic
aerosols. We conclude that to save millions of lives and restore aerosol-perturbed
rainfall patterns, while limiting global warming to 2 {\textdegree}C, a rapid phaseout
of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources
are needed.Anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols are associated with climate
change and human health risks. We used a global model to estimate the climate and
public health outcomes attributable to fossil fuel use, indicating the potential
benefits of a phaseout. We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate
of 3.61 (2.96{\textendash}4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide.
This could be up to 5.55 (4.52{\textendash}6.52) million per year by additionally
controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions
account for about 65\% of the excess mortality, and 70\% of the climate cooling by
anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust
contributes to the aerosol cooling. Because aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle,
removing the anthropogenic emissions in the model increases rainfall by 10{\textendash}70\%
over densely populated regions in India and 10{\textendash}30\% over northern China,
and by 10{\textendash}40\% over Central America, West Africa, and the drought-prone Sahel,
thus contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic
rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates
0.51({\textpm}0.03) {\textdegree}C and all pollution particles 0.73({\textpm}0.03) {\textdegree}C
warming, reaching around 2 {\textdegree}C over North America and Northeast Asia.
The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about
0.36({\textpm}0.06) {\textdegree}C globally by the simultaneous reduction of
ropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related
emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save
millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global
warming to 2 {\textdegree}C.},

Title = {{Isotopologue consistency of semi-empirically computed infrared line
   lists and further improvement for rare isotopologues: CO$_2$ and SO$_2$ case
   studies}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {230},
Pages = {222-246},
Abstract = {The semi-empirical molecular rovibrational IR line lists, such as
   ExoMol, TheoReTs, and Ames, combine the experimental accuracy and
   theoretical power to reach better than 0.1 cm(-1) accuracy for line
   positions and better than 80-90\% agreement for line intensities. The
   quality of these existing semi-empirical IR lists allows further
   improvements of intensity and line positions for those unobserved minor
   isotopologues. This paper presents our new BTRHE (Best Theory + Reliable
   High-resolution Experiment) strategy implementation. For line intensity,
   the isotopologue consistency and the patterns of mass dependence in the
   Ames-296 K SO2 and CO2 IR lists are quantitatively presented along the
   mass-inverse coordinates. The consistency and patterns are better than
   those in existing experimental data. The methodology proposed here can
   be used to identify inconsistencies, outliers, and mistakes in
   intensities, and help improve Effective Dipole Model (EDM) and molecular
   IR databases. We call for an experimental study on the 50006 and 60007
   bands of CO2 628. For line position predictions, a simple approach
   combining the variational IR line lists with Effective Hamiltonian (EH)
   model may refine the effective rotational constants A(0)/B-0/C-0 and
   quartic centrifugal distortion constants of minor isotopologues. The
   prediction accuracy may be improved by two orders of magnitude, i.e.
   reaching 0-5 MHz prediction accuracy in the range of J < 20-30, K-a <
   10-20, and 0.01-0.02MHz accuracy for A(0)/B-0/C-o. Several important
   factors have been systematically investigated and discussed, e.g.
   convergence, uncertainties, higher order terms, fixing EH parameters,
   mass coordinates, etc. A microwave (MW) line set consisting of 644,636
   strong transitions (at 296K) for all 30 isotopologues and corresponding
   refined EH(Ames) parameters are reported in the supplementary material.
   This approach may be easily extended to rovibrational bands, hot bands,
   and other molecular systems. },

   change. A self-calibrated multiharmonic measurement system based on
   tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) with wavelength
   modulation spectroscopy, using the vertical-cavity surface-emitting
   laser, is developed and applied to measure the CO2 and H2O
   concentrations in the urban areas. The precision of the developed system
   is evaluated using the Allan variance method, and it is found that the
   multiharmonic can enhance the precision of the system and the
   first-to-third harmonics are sufficient to achieve the lowest Allan
   deviation. To validate its accuracy, comparison experiments with the
   commercial nondispersive infrared (NDIR) instrument (Li-Cor 840A) are
   performed and the results demonstrate the high accuracy of the TDLAS
   system and its consistency with the NDIR instrument. Measurements were
   carried out in autumn and winter of 2017 in the city center of Munich.
   The results indicate that the in situ measurement of the CO2
   concentration in the downtown area correlates with both natural and
   anthropogenic activities. Due to its high precision and accuracy, the
   self-calibrated multiharmonic measurement system has a great potential
   to further study the emission and distribution of CO2 in the urban

Abstract = {We present a new cavity ring-down spectroscopy system which was

   of atmospheric gases. This laser spectrometer was developed in the
   framework of the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 project to improve
   our understanding of line shape parameters for carbon dioxide and
   oxygen. The apparatus consists of a monolithic, fixed-mirror ring-down
   cavity within a temperature- regulated enclosure, which is interrogated
   by a tunable, single-frequency diode laser. We experimentally
   characterize and model the dependence of the spectrum detuning axis at
   each setpoint temperature, and show that absolute frequencies are stable
   to within 200 kHz over several hours, corresponding to temperature
   stabilities better than 1 mK. We measure the R16e (30013-0001)
   (CO2)-C-12-O-16 transition and carry out multi-spectrum analyses using
   two line profiles incorporating speed-dependent (quadratic
   approximation) and Dicke narrowing (hard collision assumption) effects.
   The resulting broadening coefficient and temperature exponent are in
   excellent agreement (0.05\% level) with previous high-resolution

abstract = {A new 626-based Ames-2 PES refinement and Ames-2016 line lists for 13 CO2
isotopologues are reported. A consistent σRMS = ±0.02 cm−1 is established for hundreds
of isotopologue band origins using the Ames-2 PES. Ames-2016 line lists are computed
at 296 K, 1000 K and 4000 K using the Ames-2 PES and the same DMS-N2 dipole surface
used previously, with J up to 150, E′ up to 24,000 cm−1 or 18,000 cm−1 and appropriate
intensity cutoffs. The lists are compared to the CDSD-296, CDSD-4000 databases,
UCL line lists, and a few recent highly accurate CO2 intensity measurements. Both
agreements and discrepancies are discussed. Compared to the old Ames CO2 lists,
the Ames-2016 line lists have line position deviations reduced by 50% or more,
which consequently leads to more reliable intensities. The line shape parameters
in the Ames-2016 line lists are predicted using the newly assigned conventional
vibrational polyad quantum numbers for rovibrational levels below 12,000 cm−1 so
the quality of the line shape parameters is similar to that of CDSD or HITRAN.
This study further proves that a semi-empirically refined PES (Ames-1 and Ames-2)
coupled with a high quality ab initio DMS (DMS-N2 and UCL) may generate IR predictions
with consistent accuracy and is thus helpful in the analysis of laboratory spectra
and simulations of various isotopologues. The Ames-2016 lists based on DMS-N2 have
reached the ∼1% intensity prediction accuracy level for the recent 626 30013-00001
and 20013-00001 bands, but further quantification and improvements require sub-percent
or sub-half-percent accurate experimental intensities. The inter-isotopologue consistency
of the intensity prediction accuracies should have reached better than 1–3% for
regular bands not affected by resonances. Since the Effective Dipole Models (EDM)
in CDSD and HITRAN have 1–20% or even larger uncertainties, we show that the Ames
lists can provide better alternative IR data for many hard-to-determine isotopologue
bands. Comparison at 4000 K suggests that the Ames-4000 K 12C16O2 line list is
reliable and consistent within the current cutoffs of J ≤ 150 and E′  ≤ 24,000 cm−1,
but intensity contributions involving higher energy levels should not be omitted
and future computations need to be converged up to at least 32,000 cm−1 or higher.
The remaining issues are discussed regarding the source of energy level discrepancies,
intensity underestimations by ∼50% for some weak bands, etc. and also future work.},

the parameters of spectral transmission functions of ÃÂ¡ÃÅ¾2 are obtained at
different temperatures in the vibration-rotation and pressure-induced bands of ÃÂ¡ÃÅ¾2.
Practical application of the obtained radiative characteristics is considered for
solving problems of radiative heat exchange in planetary atmospheres and high-temperature
media and designing optoelectronic systems intended for aero carriers monitoring.},

Title = {{Carbon dioxide in exoplanetary atmospheres: RArely dominant compared to
   carbon monoxide and water in hot, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {817},
pages = {149},
Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the abundance of carbon dioxide in
   exoplanetary atmospheres in hot, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We
   construct novel analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium
   that include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, methane and
   acetylene and relate the equilibrium constants of the chemical reactions
   to temperature and pressure via the tabulated Gibbs free energies. We
   prove that such chemical systems may be described by a quintic equation
   for the mixing ratio of methane. By examining the abundances of these
   molecules across a broad range of temperatures (spanning equilibrium
   temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via temperature-pressure
   profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and
   carbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant
   compared to carbon monoxide and water. Atmospheric mixing does not alter
   this conclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the
   atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable
   abundances if the metallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is
   negated by temperatures above 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated
   atmospheres, our generic result has the implication that retrieval
   studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon dioxide as a prior of
   the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam free as a
   fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions. We
   discuss the relevance of these implications for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b
   and suggest that some of the previous results are chemically impossible.
   The relative abundance of carbon dioxide to acetylene is potentially a
   sensitive diagnostic of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio.},

abstract = {Abstract This study reports the results from analyzing a number of high
resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra in the 2.06-ÃŽÂ¼m spectral
region for pure \{CO2\} and mixtures of \{CO2\} in dry air. A multispectrum nonlinear
least squares curve fitting technique has been used to retrieve the various spectral
line parameters. The dataset includes 27 spectra: ten pure CO2, two 99\% 13C-enriched \{CO2\}
and fifteen spectra of mixtures of 12C-enriched \{CO2\} in dry air. The spectra
were recorded at various gas sample temperatures between 170 and 297 K. The absorption
path lengths range from 0.347 to 49 m. The sample pressures for the pure \{CO2\}
spectra varied from 1.1 to 594 Torr; for the two 13CO2 spectra the pressures
were Ã¢Ë†Â¼10 and 146 Torr. For the air-broadened spectra, the pressures of the
gas mixtures varied between 200 and 711 Torr with \{CO2\} volume mixing ratios
ranging from 0.014\% to 0.203\%. The multispectrum fitting technique was applied
to fit simultaneously all these spectra to retrieve consistent set of line positions,
intensities, and line shape parameters including their temperature dependences;
for this, the Voigt line shape was modified to include line mixing (via the relaxation
matrix formalism) and quadratic speed dependence. The new results are compared
to select published values, including recent ab initio calculations. These results
are required to retrieve the column averaged dry air mole fraction (XCO2) from
space-based observations, such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite
mission that \{NASA\} launched in July 2014.},

abstract = {Planets larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune are some of the most
numerous in the galaxy, but observational efforts to understand this population
have proved challenging because optically thick clouds or hazes at high altitudes
obscure molecular features. We present models of super Earths that include thick
clouds and hazes and predict their transmission, thermal emission, and reflected
light spectra. Very thick, lofted clouds of salts or sulfides in high metallicity
(1000× solar) atmospheres create featureless transmission spectra in the near-infrared.
Photochemical hazes with a range of particle sizes also create featureless transmission
spectra at lower metallicities. Cloudy thermal emission spectra have muted features
more like blackbodies, and hazy thermal emission spectra have emission features
caused by an inversion layer at altitudes where the haze forms. Close analysis of
reflected light from warm (∼400–800 K) planets can distinguish cloudy spectra,
which have moderate albedos (0.05–0.20), from hazy models, which are very dark (0.0–0.03).
Reflected light spectra of cold planets (∼200 K) accessible to a space-based visible
light coronagraph will have high albedos and large molecular features that will
allow them to be more easily characterized than the warmer transiting planets.
We suggest a number of complementary observations to characterize this population
of planets, including transmission spectra of hot ( K) targets, thermal emission
spectra of warm targets using the James Webb Space Telescope, high spectral
resolution (R ∼ 105) observations of cloudy targets, and reflected light spectral
observations of directly imaged cold targets. Despite the dearth of features observed
in super Earth transmission spectra to date, different observations will provide
rich diagnostics of their atmospheres.},

suboptimal experimental conditions, has a 3.5-modern, 1- ÃÆ’ precision for detection
of milligram-sized, carbon-14-elevated samples. These results demonstrate proof

Abstract = {Venus' atmosphere consists of about 95\% of carbon dioxide, which
   accounts for most of the absorption of the radiation emitted by its hot

   make the absorption much more complex than for low density atmospheres
   such as Earth or Mars. Available experimental data are at present

abstract = {An algorithm is developed to retrieve the vertical profile of carbon
dioxide in the 5 to 25 km altitude range using mid-infrared solar occultation
spectra from the main instrument of the ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment)
mission, namely the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS). The main challenge is
to find an atmospheric phenomenon which can be used for accurate tangent height
determination in the lower atmosphere, where the tangent heights (THs) calculated
from geometric and timing information are not of sufficient accuracy. Error budgets
for the retrieval of CO2 from ACE-FTS and the FTS on a potential follow-on mission
named CASS (Chemical and Aerosol Sounding Satellite) are calculated and contrasted.
Retrieved THs have typical biases of 60 m relative to those retrieved using the
ACE version 3.x software after revisiting the temperature dependence of the N2
CIA (collision-induced absorption) laboratory measurements and accounting for
sulfate aerosol extinction. After correcting for the known residual high bias
of ACE version 3.x THs expected from CO2 spectroscopic/isotopic inconsistencies,
the remaining bias for tangent heights determined with the N2 CIA is -20 m. CO2
in the 5-13 km range in the 2009-2011 time frame is validated against aircraft
measurements from CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the
atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container), CONTRAIL (Comprehensive Observation
Network for Trace gases by Airline), and HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations),
yielding typical biases of -1.7 ppm in the 5-13 km range. The standard error of
these biases in this vertical range is 0.4 ppm. The multi-year ACE-FTS data set
is valuable in determining the seasonal variation of the latitudinal gradient which
arises from the strong seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere.
The annual growth of CO2 in this time frame is determined to be 2.6 Ã‚Â± 0.4 ppm
year-1, in agreement with the currently accepted global growth rate based on
ground-based measurements. },

Title = {{High-temperature measurements of VUV-absorption cross sections of CO$_2$
   and their application to exoplanets}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {551},
pages = {A131},
Abstract = {Context. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption cross sections are an essential
   ingredient of photochemical atmosphere models. Exoplanet searches have
   unveiled a large population of short-period objects with hot
   atmospheres, very different from what we find in our solar system.
   Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can now be studied by transit
   spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and have typical
   temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV
   photolysis cross section data are severely lacking.
   Aims. Our goal is to provide high-temperature absorption cross sections
   and their temperature dependency for important atmospheric compounds.
   This study is dedicated to CO2, which is observed and photodissociated
   in exoplanet atmospheres. We also investigate the influence of these new
   data on the photochemistry of some exoplanets.
   Methods. We performed these measurements with synchrotron radiation as a
   tunable VUV light source for the 115-200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and
   550 K. In the 195-230 nm range, we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5 m
   Jobin-Yvon spectrometer and we worked at seven temperatures between 465
   and 800 K. We implemented the measured cross section into a 1D
   photochemical model.
   Results. For lambda > 170 nm, the wavelength dependence of ln(sigma(CO2)
   (lambda,T) x 1/Q(v)(T)) can be parametrized with a linear law. Thus, we
   can interpolate sigma(CO2) (lambda,T) at any temperature between 300 and
   800 K. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross section
   can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,
   makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230
   nm, while it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K.
   Conclusions. The absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to
   temperature, especially above 160 nm. The model predicts that accounting
   for this temperature dependency of CO2 cross section can affect the
   computed abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by one order of magnitude in the
   atmospheres of hot Jupiter and hot Neptune. This effect will be more
   important in hot CO2-dominated atmospheres.},

Abstract = {A scanning differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument for
   identification of carbon dioxide leaks at carbon sequestration sites has
   been developed and initial data has been collected at Montana State
   University. The laser transmitter uses two tunable discrete mode laser
   diodes operating in the continuous-wave mode with one locked to the
   online absorption wavelength and the other operating at the offline
   wavelength. Two in-line fiber optic switches are used to switch between
   online and offline operation. After the fiber optic switch, an
   acousto-optic modulator is used to generate a pulse train used to
   injection seed an erbium-doped fiber amplifier to produce eye-safe laser
   pulses with maximum pulse energies of 66 mu J, a pulse repetition
   frequency of 15 kHz, and an operating wavelength of 1.571 mu m. The DIAL
   receiver uses a 28 cm diameter Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope to collect
   that backscattered light, which is then monitored using a
   photomultiplier tube module operating in the photon counting mode. The
   DIAL has measured carbon dioxide profiles from 1 to 2.5 km with 60 min
   temporal averaging. Comparisons of DIAL measurements with a Licor LI-820

Abstract = {Ab initio calculations of the shapes of pure CO2 infrared and Raman

   the classical equations of dynamics are solved for each molecule among
   several millions treated as linear rigid rotors and interacting through
   an anisotropic intermolecular potential. Two of the approximations used
   in the previous studies have been corrected, allowing the consideration
   of line-mixing effects without use of any adjusted parameters. The

   transitions are cut off at 1E-42 cm molecule(-1) (296 K) and 1E-36 cm
   molecule(-1) (1000 K). These are the first line lists available to cover
   reliably the energy region as high as similar to 20,000 cm(-1). Recent
   experimental data at 1.1 mu m has confirmed the predicted intensities
   for the 50013-00001 and 50014-00001 band transitions have better than

Abstract = {The radiocarbon content of whole air provides a theoretically ideal and
   now observationally proven tracer for recently added fossil-fuel-derived
   CO2 in the atmosphere (C-ff). Over large industrialized land areas,
   determination of C-ff also constrains the change in CO2 due to uptake
   and release by the terrestrial biosphere. Here, we review the
   development of a Delta(CO2)-C-14 measurement program and its
   implementation within the US portion of the NOAA Global Monitoring
   Division's air sampling network. The Delta(CO2)-C-14 measurement
   repeatability is evaluated based on surveillance cylinders of whole air
   and equates to a C-ff detection limit of <= 0.9 ppm from measurement
   uncertainties alone. We also attempt to quantify additional sources of
   uncertainty arising from non-fossil terms in the atmospheric (CO2)-C-14
   budget and from uncertainties in the composition of ``background{''} air
   against which C-ff enhancements occur. As an example of how we apply the
   measurements, we present estimates of the boundary layer enhancements of
   C-ff and Cb-io using observations obtained from vertical airborne
   sampling profiles off of the northeastern US. We also present an updated

	cm(-1) for 6873 J = 0-117 (CO2)-C-12-O-16 experimental energy levels,
	even though less than 500 (CO2)-C-12-O-16 energy levels were included
	in the refinement procedure. It is also demonstrated that, without
	any additional refinement, Ames-1 yields very good agreement for
	isotopologues. Specifically, for the (CO2)-C-12-O-16 and (CO2)-C-13-O-16
	isotopologues, spectroscopic constants G(nu) computed from Ames-1

	has led to new challenges in the refinement procedure. An initial
	high quality, purely ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is constructed
	and used to generate a 296 K line list. For most bands, experimental
	IR intensities are well reproduced for (CO2)-C-12-O-16 using Ames-1
	and the DMS. For more than 80\% of the bands, the experimental intensities
	are reproduced with sigma(rms)(Delta I) < 20\% or srms(Delta I/delta(obs))
	< 5. A few exceptions are analyzed and discussed. Directions for
	future improvements are discussed, though it is concluded that the
	current Ames-1 and the DMS should be useful in analyzing and assigning
	high-resolution laboratory or astronomical spectra.},

Abstract = {We propose an improved monitoring scheme for the instrumental line shape
   (ILS) of high-resolution, ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed)
   spectrometers used for chemical monitoring of the atmosphere by the
   Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). Good
   ILS knowledge is required for the analysis of the recorded mid-infrared
   spectra. The new method applies a sequence of measurements using
   different gas cells instead of a single calibration cell. Three cells
   are used: cell C1 is a refillable cell offering 200 mm path length and
   equipped with a pressure gauge (filled with 100 Pa N2O), cells C2 and C3
   are sealed cells offering 75 mm path length. C2 is filled with 5 Pa of
   pure N2O. Cell C3 is filled with 16 Pa N2O in 200 hPa technical air, so
   provides pressure-broadened N2O lines. We demonstrate that an ILS
   retrieval using C1 improves significantly the sensitivity of the ILS
   retrieval over the current calibration cells used in the network,
   because this cell provides narrow fully saturated N2O lines. The N2O
   columns derived from C2 and C3 allow the performance of a highly
   valuable closure experiment: adopting the ILS retrieved from C1, the N2O
   columns of C2 and C3 are derived. Because N2O is an inert gas, both
   columns should be constant on long timescales. Apparent changes in the
   columns would immediately attract attention and indicate either
   inconsistent ILS results or instrumental problems of other origin. Two
   different cells are applied for the closure experiment, because the
   NDACC spectrometers observe both stratospheric and tropospheric gases:
   C2 mimics signatures of stratospheric gases, whereas C3 mimics
   signatures of tropospheric gases.},

Abstract = {The column-average dry air mole fractions of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   and methane (X-CO2 and X-CH4) are inferred from observations of
   backscattered sunlight conducted by the Greenhouse gases Observing
   SATellite (GOSAT). Comparing the first year of GOSAT retrievals over
   land with colocated ground-based observations of the Total Carbon Column
   Observing Network (TCCON), we find an average difference (bias) of
   -0.05\% and -0.30\% for X-CO2 and X-CH4 with a station-to-station
   variability (standard deviation of the bias) of 0.37\% and 0.26\% among
   the 6 considered TCCON sites. The root-mean square deviation of the
   bias-corrected satellite retrievals from colocated TCCON observations
   amounts to 2.8 ppm for X-CO2 and 0.015 ppm for X-CH4. Without any data
   averaging, the GOSAT records reproduce general source/sink patterns such
   as the seasonal cycle of X-CO2 suggesting the use of the satellite
   retrievals for constraining surface fluxes. Citation: Butz, A., et al.

   Format of CDSD-4000 is similar to that of HITRAN-2008. The databank has
   been generated within the framework of the method of effective operators

Year = {2011},

Pages = {2809-2822},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important man-made greenhouse gas (GHG)
   that cause global warming. With electricity generation through
   fossil-fuel power plants now being the economic sector with the largest
   source of CO2, power plant emissions monitoring has become more
   important than ever in the fight against global warming. In a previous
   study done by Bovensmann et al. (2010), random and systematic errors of
   power plant CO2 emissions have been quantified using a single overpass
   from a proposed CarbonSat instrument. In this study, we quantify errors
   of power plant annual emission estimates from a hypothetical CarbonSat
   and constellations of several CarbonSats while taking into account that
   power plant CO2 emissions are time-dependent. Our focus is on estimating
   systematic errors arising from the sparse temporal sampling as well as
   random errors that are primarily dependent on wind speeds. We used
   hourly emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   combined with assimilated and re-analyzed meteorological fields from the
   National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP). CarbonSat orbits
   were simulated as a sun-synchronous low-earth orbiting satellite (LEO)
   with an 828-km orbit height, local time ascending node (LTAN) of 13:30
   (01:30 p.m. LT) and achieves global coverage after 5 days. We show, that
   despite the variability of the power plant emissions and the limited
   satellite overpasses, one CarbonSat has the potential to verify reported
   US annual CO2 emissions from large power plants (>= 5 MtCO(2) yr(-1))
   with a systematic error of less than similar to 4.9\% and a random error
   of less than similar to 6.7\% for 50\% of all the power plants. For 90\%
   of all the power plants, the systematic error was less than similar to
   12.4\% and the random error was less than similar to 13 \%. We
   additionally investigated two different satellite configurations using a
   combination of 5 CarbonSats. One achieves global coverage everyday but
   only samples the targets at fixed local times. The other configuration
   samples the targets five times at two-hour intervals approximately every
   6th day but only achieves global coverage after 5 days. From the
   statistical analyses, we found, as expected, that the random errors
   improve by approximately a factor of two if 5 satellites are used. On
   the other hand, more satellites do not result in a large reduction of
   the systematic error. The systematic error is somewhat smaller for the
   CarbonSat constellation configuration achieving global coverage
   everyday. Therefore, we recommend the CarbonSat constellation
   configuration that achieves daily global coverage.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {111},

Abstract = {In a previous series of papers, a model for the calculation of CO2-air
   absorption coefficients taking line-mixing into account and the
   corresponding database/software package were described and widely
   tested. In this study, we present an update of this package, based on
   the 2008 version of HITRAN, the latest currently available. The
   spectroscopic data for the seven most-abundant isotopologues are taken
   from HITRAN. When the HITRAN data are not complete up to J `'=70, the
   data files are augmented with spectroscopic parameters from the CD5D-296
   database and the high-temperature CDSD-1000 if necessary. Previously
   missing spectroscopic parameters, the air-induced pressure shifts and
   CO2 line broadening coefficients with H2O, have been added. The quality
   of this new database is demonstrated by comparisons of calculated
   absorptions and measurements using CO2 high-pressure laboratory spectra
   in the 1.5-2.3 mu m region. The influence of the imperfections and
   inaccuracies of the spectroscopic parameters from the 2000 version of
   HITRAN is clearly shown as a big improvement of the residuals is
   observed by using the new database. The very good agreements between
   calculated and measured absorption coefficients confirm the necessity of
   the update presented here and further demonstrate the importance of
   line-mixing effects, especially for the high pressures investigated
   here. The application of the updated database/software package to
   atmospheric spectra should result in an increased accuracy in the
   retrieval of CO2 atmospheric amounts. This opens improved perspectives
   for the space-borne detection of carbon dioxide sources and sinks.},

polyatomic molecules are essential tools for reliable modeling of the photochemistry

and published, but they are of uneven spectral resolution and coverage; moreover,
in many cases, they are unavailable in computer-readable forms needed for incorporation
in modeling calculations. Furthermore, most laboratory investigations have been
conducted at room temperature. Perhaps most serious is that there are relatively
few published assessments or critical evaluations of absolute calibration and reliability,
or which laboratory experiments should be most trusted. Here, we report the results
of critical evaluation of the ultraviolet photoabsorption cross section of the
carbon dioxide molecule (CO2), the principal component of the atmospheres of Venus
and Mars, and an important component of comets. By careful comparison and selection
of data from published laboratory investigations, we have assembled, documented,
analyzed, recommended, and make available a data file of absorption cross sections
at 25,016 wavelengths between 0.125 and 201.6 nm at room temperature.},

Abstract = {Using the NICMOS instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
   measured the dayside spectrum of HD 209458b between 1.5 and 2.5 mu m.
   The emergent spectrum is dominated by features due to the presence of
   methane (CH4) and water vapor (H2O), with smaller contributions from
   carbon dioxide (CO2). Combining this near-infrared spectrum with
   existing mid-infrared measurements shows the existence of a temperature
   inversion and confirms the interpretation of previous photometry
   measurements. We find a family of plausible solutions for the molecular
   abundance and detailed temperature profile. Observationally resolving
   the ambiguity between abundance and temperature requires either (1)
   improved wavelength coverage or spectral resolution of the dayside
   emission spectrum or (2) a transmission spectrum where abundance
   determinations are less sensitive to the temperature structure.},

Title = {{Influence of line mixing on the retrievals of atmospheric CO$_2$ from
spectra in the 1.6 and 2.1 $\mu$m regions}},
Journal = ACP,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {7303-7312},
Abstract = {We present the first study of the influence of line mixing among CO2
   lines on the remote sensing retrieval of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
   This is done in the bands near 1.6 and 2.1 mu m which will be used by
   the Greenhouse Gases Observatory Satellite (GOSAT) instrument and
   eventual successors of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO). A purely
   theoretical analysis is first made, based on simulations of atmospheric
   spectra. It shows that line mixing cannot be neglected since
   disregarding this process induces significant errors in the calculated
   absorption coefficients, leading to systematic structures in the
   spectral fit residuals and airmass-dependent biases in the retrieved CO2
   amounts. These theoretical predictions are then confirmed by using
   atmospheric solar-absorption spectra measured by a ground-based Fourier
   transform spectrometer. It is first shown that including line mixing in
   the forward model used for the inversion leads to a very significant
   reduction of the residuals in the 2.1 mu m region. Secondly, the
   inclusion of line mixing reduces the dependence of the retrieved CO2 on
   the airmass and greatly improves the consistency between values obtained
   independently from spectra in the 1.6 and 2.1 mu m bands. These results
   open promising prospects for various ground-based and space-borne
   experiments monitoring the carbon dioxide atmospheric amounts.},

Title = {{Orbiting carbon observatory: Inverse method and prospective error analysis}},
Journal = JGR,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
pages = {D05305},
Abstract = {The objective, design, and implementation of the OCO inverse method are
   presented. The inverse method is the algorithm which finds the
   profile-weighted mean mixing ratio, X-CO2, which best fits the measured
   spectrum, given a ``forward model'' which calculates the spectrum for a
   given atmospheric state, surface, and instrument properties. Minimizing
   bias among comparative values of X-CO2 is a critical objective. The
   algorithm uses an ``optimal,'' maximum a posteriori inverse method, with
   weak a priori constraint, and employs a state vector containing
   atmospheric and surface properties expected to vary significantly
   between soundings. An extensive operational characterization and error
   analysis will be employed, producing quantities designed to aid
   atmospheric modelers in use of the OCO data. In particular, comparison
   to inverse models of surface CO2 flux will require use of the OCO column
   averaging kernel and a priori state vector. An off-line error analysis
   has also been developed for more detailed error studies, and its use is
   illustrated by prospective application to case studies of nadir
   observations in summer and winter at three sites. Uncertainties due to
   noise, geophysical variability, and spectroscopic parameters are
   considered in detail. At low and midlatitudes, the single-sounding
   errors due to these sources are expected to be similar to 0.7-0.8 ppm
   for high-sun conditions and similar to 1.5-2.5 ppm for low sun (winter).
   Errors from the same sources in semimonthly regional averages are
   predicted to be < 1 ppm for all conditions.},

Abstract = {The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) mission will make the first
   global, space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2))
   with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize
   CO(2) sources and sinks on regional scales. The measurement approach and
   instrument specifications were determined through an analysis of
   existing carbon cycle data and a series of observing system simulation
   experiments. During its 2-year mission, OCO will fly in a 1: 15 PM
   sun-synchronous orbit with a 16-day ground-track repeat time, just ahead
   of the EOS Aqua platform. It will carry a single instrument that
   incorporates three bore-sighted high-resolution spectrometers designed
   to measure reflected sunlight in the 0.76-mum O(2) A-band and in the
   CO(2) bands at 1.61 and 2.06 mum. Soundings recorded in these three
   bands will be used to retrieve the column-averaged CO(2) dry air mole
   fraction (X(CO2)). A comprehensive validation program was included in
   the mission to ensure that the space-based X(CO2) measurements have
   precisions of similar to0.3\% (1 ppm) on regional scales. OCO
   measurements will be used in global synthesis inversion and data
   assimilation models to quantify CO(2) sources and sinks. While OCO will
   have a nominal lifetime of only 2 years, it will serve as a pathfinder
   for future long-term CO(2) monitoring missions. },

Abstract = {We present a high-temperature version, CDSD-1000, of the carbon dioxide
   spectroscopic databank. The databank contains the line parameters
   (positions, intensities, air- and self-broadened half-widths and
   coefficients of temperature dependence of air-broadened half-widths) of
   the four most abundant isotopic species of the carbon dioxide molecule.
   The reference temperature is T-ref = 1000 K and the intensity cutoff is
   I-cut = 10(-27) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2). More than 3 million lines
   covering the 260-8310, 418-2454, 394-4662, and 429-2846 cm(-1) spectral
   ranges for (CO2)-C-12-O-16, (CO2)-C-13-O-16, (COO)-C-12-O-16-O-18, and
   (COO)-C-12-O-16-O-17, respectively, are included in CDSD-1000. The
   databank has been generated within the framework of the method of
   effective operators and based on the global fittings of spectroscopic
   parameters (parameters of the effective Hamiltonians and effective
   dipole moment operators) to observed data collected from the literature.
   Line-by-line simulations of several low- and medium-resolution
   high-temperature (T = 800-3000 K) spectra have been performed in order
   to validate the databank. Comparisons of CDSD-1000 with other
   high-temperature databanks HITEMP, HITELOR, and EM2C are also given.
   CDSD-1000 is able to reproduce observed spectra in a more satisfactory
   way than the high-resolution databank HITEMP for temperatures higher
   than 1000 K. The databank is useful for studying high-temperature
   radiative properties of CO2. CDSD-1000 is freely accessible via the
   Internet.},

Title = {{Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 60 million years}},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2000},
Volume = {406},
Pages = {695-699},
Abstract = {Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
   throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the
   links between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface
   temperatures. Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the
   early Cenozoic era (about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been
   higher than at present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon
   dioxide levels, the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are
   most important for the control of CO2 concentrations over geological
   timescales. Here we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic
   foraminifer shells to estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water
   throughout the past 60 million years, which can be used to reconstruct
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We estimate CO2 concentrations of more
   than 2,000 p.p.m. for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods
   (from about 60 to 52 Myr ago), and rnd an erratic decline between 55 and
   40 Myr ago that may have been caused by reduced CO2 outgassing from
   ocean ridges, volcanoes and metamorphic belts and increased carbon
   burial. Since the early Miocene (about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO2
   concentrations appear to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more
   stable than before, although transient intervals of CO2 reduction may
   have occurred during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.},

correctly classified all 36 Helicobacter-pylori-negative and all 15 H-pylori-positive

NDIRS is of equal value as IRMS for the diagnosis of H pylori infection. Because
NDIRS gives on-line results and is easier and cheaper, we consider NDIRS useful
for clinical practice.},

abstract = { A direct measurement of the magnitude and sign of the quadrupole
moment of the carbon dioxide molecule has been made by determining the birefringence
induced in gaseous C02 by an inhomogeneous electric field. The method of measurement
and the experimental details are described. The observable is the product of the
molecular quadrupole moment 0 and the difference between parallel and perpendicular
components of the optical polarizability tensor. F o r CO2, this quantity was found
to have the value (9.1ñ0.5)x 10-50 e.s.u. can be determined by other methods,
but unfortunately the present uncertainty in this quantity is greater than that
of the product. The most satisfactory value of a a8-a1 is taken to be 2.2 x 10-24cm3,
giving for the molecular quadrupole moment of CO2 4.1 x 10 -26 e.s.u., the sign
indicating that the oxygen atoms are negative with respect to the carbon atom.
The role of the  quadrupole polarizability  of the molecule in complicating the
interpretation of the experimental results is discussed, and experiments on argon
and sulphur hexafluoride used to provide an estimate of its effect in the case of CO2. },
