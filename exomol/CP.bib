abstract = {{The potential energy curves of X 2Σ+, A 2Π, B 2Σ+, a 4Σ+, and b 4Δ states and their Ω states of CP were calculated using the icMRCI approach. The transition dipole moments between these states were computed. To improve the accuracy of the potential energy curves, core–valence correlation and scalar relativistic corrections were considered. The radiative lifetimes were approximately 10 μs for the A 2Π3/2 and A 2Π1/2 states and 100 ns for the B2Σ+1/2 state; those were approximately 10, 10 – 100, 10, 0.1 – 1, and 10 ms for the a 4Σ+1/2, a 4Σ+3/2, b 4Δ1/2, b 4Δ3/2, and b 4Δ5/2 states, respectively. The spontaneous emissions from the B 2Σ+1/2 – X 2Σ+1/2 system were strong, followed by the A 2Π3/2 – X 2Σ+1/2, A 2Π1/2 – X 2Σ+1/2, B 2Σ+1/2 – A 2Π3/2, and B 2Σ+1/2 – A 2Π1/2 transitions. The strong emissions from the A 2Π3/2 – X 2Σ+1/2 and A 2Π1/2 – X 2Σ+1/2 systems were in the infrared region; those from the B 2Σ+1/2 – X 2Σ+1/2 system were in the visible and ultraviolet regions; and those from the B 2Σ+1/2 – A 2Π3/2, and B 2Σ+1/2 – A 2Π1/2 systems were of visible light. A simple comparison shows that the effect of the spin–orbit coupling on the radiative lifetimes of the A 2Π and B 2Σ+ states was significant. The radiative–lifetime distribution of each level υ versus the rotational quantum number J was evaluated for υ ≤ 15 and J ≤ 70.5.}}

Pages = {107352},
abstract = {Rovibrational energy levels of CP are investigated for its X2Σ+
and A2Π electronic states. Rovibronic frequencies observed experimentally for
the A2Π-X2Σ+ transition are used to produce empirical energy levels with the MARVEL
method (denoted as MARVEL energy levels). The MARVEL energy levels for the X2Σ+
and A2Π states are then employed to fit the empirical potential energy curves (PECs),
spin orbit coupling curves (SOCCs) and electronic angular momentum curves (EAMCs)
by using DUO program, also constrained by the corresponding ab initio curves.
Meanwhile, empirical Born-Oppenheimer breakdown curves, spin-rotation curves (SRCs),
Λ-doubling curves are also added to well reproduce the MARVEL energy levels.
These curves referred to as analytical spectroscopic models are as an input to
DUO to obtain the fitted energy levels for the X2Σ+ and A2Π states and the line
lists for the X2Σ+-X2Σ+, A2Π-A2Π and A2Π-X2Σ+ transitions. Partition functions for
temperatures up to 5000K are computed by using the fitted energy levels and fitted
by polynomial expansions. The calculated MARVEL energies can be used for spectroscopic
investigations of the interstellar CP radical in various astrophysical sources,
especially in circumstellar envelopes and warm clouds. The rovibrational energy
levels and line lists derived from the analytical spectroscopic models can be used
for predicting spectroscopy at temperatures up to 5000K for potential applications
in related plasmas.},

Abstract = {Line strengths for bands of the A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) transition of CP,
   including the effect of rotation on the vibrational wavefunctions (the
   Herman-Wallis effect), have been calculated using Western's PGOPHER
   program and Le Roy's LEVEL program. The potential energy functions for
   the A(2)Pi and X-2 Sigma(+) state were computed using spectroscopic
   constants obtained from high resolution spectra. The RKR potentials of
   the two states, and the electronic transition dipole moments of this
   transition calculated in a recent ab initio study have been used in Le
   Roy's LEVEL program to produce transition dipole moment matrix elements.
   The matrix elements have been converted from Hund's case (b) to (a), and
   then used in PGOPHER to generate a line list containing observed and
   calculated wavenumbers, Einstein A coefficients and f-values for 75
   bands with v=0-8 for both states. The Einstein A coefficients have been
   used to compute radiative lifetimes for v=0-5 in the A(2)Pi state. The
   line list may be useful for computing the molecular opacities of CP
   needed to simulate the spectra of stellar and substellar sources},
