Title = {{Accurate Infrared Line Lists for 20 Isotopologues of CS$_2$ at
   Room Temperature}},
Journal = ApJS,
Year = {2024},
Volume = {272},
Abstract = {To facilitate atmospheric and spectroscopic studies of carbon disulfide,
   or CS2, in both planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, we adopt the
   ``Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment{''} algorithm to
   generate semiempirical IR line lists for the 20 most abundant CS2
   isotopologues, denoted as Ames-296K. The IR lists are computed using the
   Ames-1 potential energy surface, refined using the experimental
   transition set and an ab initio dipole moment surface fitted from
   CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T/Q/5+d)Z dipoles extrapolated to a one-particle basis
   set limit. The IR lists cover the range of 0-10,000 cm(-1), with an
   S-296K cutoff at 10(-31) cm(-1)/molecule center dot cm(-2) (abundance
   included). A ``natural{''} IR line list at 296 K includes about 10
   million lines of the 20 isotopologues, with their intensities scaled by
   the corresponding abundances. The zero-point energy, partition
   functions, and abundances are reported for each isotopologue. The energy
   levels in the global effective Hamiltonian model for (CS2)-C-12-S-32 are
   adopted to improve the line position accuracy. This new IR list for the
   main isotopologue is denoted as A+I.296K. Reliable HITRAN2020 line
   positions are also utilized to improve the accuracy of the
   (SCS)-S-32-C-12-S-34, (SCS)-S-32-C-12-S-33, and (SCS)-S-32-C-13-S-32
   isotopologue line lists. The final composite line list is validated
   against Pacific Northwest National Laboratory experimental cross
   sections, showing excellent agreement. The agreement supports the
   quality of the composite line list and the power of synergy between
   experiment and theory. The new data are proposed for use in updating and
   expanding the CS2 data in HITRAN and other high-resolution IR databases.

Title = {{Update on SO$_2$, detection of OCS, CS, CS$_2$, and

   mesosphere using SOIR on board Venus Express}},
Journal = {ICARUS},

Abstract = {We report on the update of SO2 and first detections of SO3, CS, and CS2,
   and detection of OCS above the cloud deck using the SOIR instrument
   on-board Venus Express, and upper limit profiles of H2S and HOCl. Based
   on the solar occultation spectra measured by SOIR covering all latitudes
   over the 2006-2014 period, we find an average SO2 volume mixing ratio of
   similar to 0.02 ppm below 90 km which increases to 5 ppm at 100 km;
   average OCS abundance of 1 ppb to 1 ppm between 65 and 100 km increasing
   with altitude; mean SO3 values of 0.1 ppm at 75 km, 1 ppm at 85 km, and
   10 ppm at 95 km; CS volume mixing ratios varying from 0.1 ppm at 65 km
   to 40 ppm at 100 km; finally we report 0.03 ppm of CS2 at 70 km and 5
   ppm at 90 km. It is important to note the detections for all of these
   species may be biased to higher volume mixing ratios at higher altitudes
   based on the detection limits for SOIR. Upper-limits for H2S and HOCl
   are determined. All abundances show large variabilities with time and/or
   latitude equal to at least one order of magnitude at all altitudes. We
   also study the detection statistics of all detected species as a
   function of time, latitude, and side of the terminator.},

Title = {{Possible Hycean conditions in the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d}},
Journal =AA,
Year = {2024},
Volume = {683},
Abstract = {The JWST has ushered in a new era in atmospheric characterisations of
   temperate low-mass exoplanets with recent detections of carbon-bearing
   molecules in the candidate Hycean world K2-18 b. We investigated JWST
   observations of the TOI-270 system, with two sub-Neptunes simultaneously
   transiting the nearby M dwarf during the visit. We report our
   atmospheric characterisation of the outer planet TOI-270 d, a candidate
   Hycean world, with JWST transmission spectroscopy using the NIRSpec
   G395H instrument in the 2.7-5.2 mu m range, combined with previous
   observations obtained with the HST WFC3 spectrograph (1.1-1.6 mu m). The
   spectrum reveals strong signatures of CH4 and CO2 at 3.8-4.9 sigma and
   2.9-3.9 sigma confidence, respectively, and no evidence of NH3. The
   abundant CH4 and CO2, at similar to 0.1-1\% mixing ratios, and the
   non-detection of NH3 are similar to the findings reported for K2-18 b
   and consistent with predictions for a Hycean world with a planet-wide
   ocean under a H-2-rich atmosphere. We also report evidence of CS2 at a
   2.3-3.0 sigma confidence and a potential inference of H2O at 1.6-4.4
   sigma, depending on the data analysis approach, and discuss possible
   interpretations of these results. The spectrum does not provide strong
   constraints on the presence of clouds or hazes in the observable
   atmosphere, nor any evidence for the effects of stellar heterogeneities,
   which is consistent with previous studies. For the smaller inner planet
   TOI-270 b, we find that the spectrum is inconsistent with a featureless
   spectrum at similar to 3 sigma, showing some preference for an H-2-rich
   atmosphere in a super-Earth. We discuss the implications of our findings
   and future prospects.},

Title = {Construction of {CS$_2$} Combustion Flame Spectral Radiation Model
   and Inversion of Characteristic Pollution Product Concentration},
Journal = {Spectrosc. Spectal Anal.},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {672-677},
Abstract = {CS2 plays an important role in today' s chemical industry and other
   fields, while CS2 fire pollution accidents are extremely harmful. It is
   necessary to study the fire pollution characteristics of CS2 by studying
   the spectral radiation of CS2 combustion flame. Has set up a platform
   CS2 combustion flame spectrum test, this paper adopts from a complete
   set of VSR instrument calibration blackbody radiation sources, through
   infrared spectrum radiometer VSR test 5 cm, to 10 cm, 20 cm three scales
   CS2 combustion flame spectrum, and through the thermocouple tested the
   whole combustion flame temperature under different combustion period,
   and installed over the flame to monitor the quality of flame in the
   combustion product concentration of flue gas analyzer. The flame
   temperature during the whole combustion period of CS2, the flame
   spectrum and the composition information of combustion products at
   different combustion times and scales were measured. The test results
   show that the CS2 flame mainly contains high temperature gases such as
   SO2, CO2, CO and H2O and the concentration of characteristic pollution
   product SO2 is obtained. Due to the limited measurement resolution of
   existing spectrometers and the limited flame scale measured in
   laboratory experiments, to achieve online fire monitoring, it is
   necessary to establish a flame spectral radiation model to retrieve the
   pollutant concentration-related information in CS2 fire. Based on the
   HITRAN database is near 2. 7 mu m for high temperature and water vapor
   emission peak, 4. 2 mu m for CS2 emission peak, around 4. 7 mu m is CO
   faint emission peak, near 7. 4 pm for SO2 emission peak. We have gained
   CS2, SO2, CO2, CO and H2O gas in the absorption coefficient of the same
   temperature and calculate mixed gas transmittance and the emissivity,
   Combined with the gas radiation transfer equation and gas absorption
   coefficient equation, the flame spectral radiation model of CS2
   combustion is established. The spectral radiation model was used to
   invert the characteristic pollutant SO2 under different combustion times
   and compared with the experimental data. The results show that this
   model has high accuracy and can to invert the concentration of
   combustion products quantitatively. The accuracy of inversion of SO2
   concentration at the time of 20, 40, 60 and 80 s is 89. 5\%, 82. 5\%,
   85. 6\% and 86. 5\%, respectively. It lays a foundation for remote
   sensing monitoring and inversion of the concentration of combustion
   products in CS2 large-scale fire.},

    abstract = "{Several sulphur-bearing species have already been observed in different families of comets. However, the knowledge on the minor sulphur species is still limited. The comet's sulphur inventory is closely linked to the pre-solar cloud and holds important clues to the degree of reprocessing of the material in the solar nebula and during comet accretion. Sulphur in pre-solar clouds is highly depleted, which is quite puzzling as the S/O ratio in the diffuse interstellar medium is cosmic. This work focuses on the abundance of the previously known species H2S, OCS, SO, S2, SO2 and CS2 in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko measured by Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis/Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer between equinox and perihelion 2015. Furthermore, we present the first detection of S3, S4, CH3SH and C2H6S in a comet, and we determine the elemental abundance of S/O in the bulk ice of (1.47 ± 0.05) × 10−2. We show that SO is present in the coma originating from the nucleus, but not CS in the case of 67P, and for the first time establish that S2 is present in a volatile and a refractory phase. The derived total elemental sulphur abundance of 67P is in agreement with solar photospheric elemental abundances and shows no sulphur depletion as reported for dense interstellar clouds. Also the presence of S2 at heliocentric distances larger than 3 au indicates that sulphur-bearing species have been processed by radiolysis in the pre-solar cloud and that at least some of the ice from this cloud has survived in comets up the present.}",

abstract = {Radiative transfer-scattering models were used to fit the Hubble Space Telescope UV spectroscopic observations of Jupiter taken 2.5 hours after the impact of fragment G of comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9. They yield abundances for NH3 and CS2 of (0.25–1.3) × 1016cm−2 and (0.43–1.1) × 1015cm−2 respectively, at unit optical depth level in the part of the atmosphere above the G-impact site. This range in the abundances is caused by the uncertainty in the composition of the aerosol material and the atmospheric pressure level where the aerosol unit optical depth in the UV occurs. The upper limits of H2S, PH3, C2H2, and C6H6 at the unit optical depth level are 1.2 × 1016cm−2, 3.3 × 1014cm−2, 1.0 × 1017cm−2, and 3.3 × 1014cm−2, respectively. The abundance of NH3 and the upper end of the CS2 abundance range are now found to be each approximately a factor of two lower than was reported previously [Noll et al., 1995], and H2S is not detected.},
