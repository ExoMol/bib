   Room Temperature}},

Abstract = {To facilitate atmospheric and spectroscopic studies of carbon disulfide,
   or CS2, in both planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, we adopt the
   ``Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment{''} algorithm to
   generate semiempirical IR line lists for the 20 most abundant CS2
   isotopologues, denoted as Ames-296K. The IR lists are computed using the
   Ames-1 potential energy surface, refined using the experimental
   transition set and an ab initio dipole moment surface fitted from
   CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T/Q/5+d)Z dipoles extrapolated to a one-particle basis
   set limit. The IR lists cover the range of 0-10,000 cm(-1), with an
   S-296K cutoff at 10(-31) cm(-1)/molecule center dot cm(-2) (abundance
   included). A ``natural{''} IR line list at 296 K includes about 10
   million lines of the 20 isotopologues, with their intensities scaled by
   the corresponding abundances. The zero-point energy, partition
   functions, and abundances are reported for each isotopologue. The energy
   levels in the global effective Hamiltonian model for (CS2)-C-12-S-32 are
   adopted to improve the line position accuracy. This new IR list for the
   main isotopologue is denoted as A+I.296K. Reliable HITRAN2020 line
   positions are also utilized to improve the accuracy of the
   (SCS)-S-32-C-12-S-34, (SCS)-S-32-C-12-S-33, and (SCS)-S-32-C-13-S-32
   isotopologue line lists. The final composite line list is validated
   against Pacific Northwest National Laboratory experimental cross
   sections, showing excellent agreement. The agreement supports the
   quality of the composite line list and the power of synergy between
   experiment and theory. The new data are proposed for use in updating and
   expanding the CS2 data in HITRAN and other high-resolution IR databases.
