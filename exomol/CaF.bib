Abstract = {The spectral analysis of molecule-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
   stars is challenging. Although other calcium and fluorine bearing
   molecules are observed in the microwave and in the visible spectrum of
   AGB stars, CaF has never been detected, despite favorable chemical
   equilibrium predictions. Yet, measuring the CaF abundance could give
   more insight into the fluorine budget of AGB stars and allow better
   simulation of stellar spectra. In this work, we present an analysis of
   the visible spectrum of CaF obtained with a Fourier transform
   spectrometer. CaF A2 Pi-X2 Sigma+ and B2 Sigma+-X2 Sigma+ band systems
   were excited with a hollow cathode discharge. Using previous
   fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, highly accurate ground state
   constants, and reasonable extrapolation schemes, the strongest features
   of CaF in the visible spectrum can be accurately modeled for both band
   systems. Spectroscopic constants are determined for A2 Pi with v <= 16
   and for B2 Sigma+ with v <= 20. Ab initio transition dipole moment
   curves of both transitions were calculated and scaled, and we provide a
   line list with Einstein A coefficients and oscillator strengths. This
   line list can be used to simulate spectra of CaF at temperatures and
   pressures relevant to astrophysical environments.},

abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of the ground and five low-lying excited states of CaF have been calculated using the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction method (MRCI) with a large contracted basis set cc-pvNz (N = t, q, 5) for atoms Ca and F and extrapolate to complete basis set (CBS). Based on the PECs, the spectroscopic terms, spectroscopic parameters have been determined. The present results are in good agreement with the experimental data available at present, and better than the theoretical results in the literature, although the present equilibrium positions are a little larger. We also calculate the vibrational levels for each state, and they are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. It implies that the method to determine the molecular properties through calculating \{PECs\} and solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation of nuclear motion is effective for CaF molecule. }
