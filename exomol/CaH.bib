Abstract = {{In this work, electron-propagator methods are applied to the calculation
   of the ionization potential and vertical excitation energies for several
   Rydberg series of the CaH molecule. The present calculations cover more
   highly excited states than those previously reported. In particular,
   excitation energies for ns (n > 5), np (n > 5), nd (n > 4) and of
   Rydberg states are given. Oscillator strengths for electronic
   transitions involving Rydberg states of CaH, as well as photoionization
   cross sections for Rydberg channels, also have been determined by using
   the Molecular Quantum Defect Orbital approach. Good agreement has been
   found with the scarce comparative data that are available for oscillator
   strengths. To our knowledge, predictions of photoionization cross
   sections from the outermost orbital of CaH are made here for the first
   time. A Cooper minimum and mixed atomic orbital character in some of the
   Dyson orbitals are among the novel features of these present
   calculations. }},

   Sigma(+) -> X-2 Sigma(+) band systems of CaH}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {288},
Pages = {46-51},
Abstract = {High resolution Fourier transform emission spectra of CaH have been
   recorded in the 12000-17000 cm(-1) spectral region, containing several
   bands of the A(2)Pi -> X-2 Sigma(+) and B-2 Sigma(+) -> X-2 Sigma(+)
   transitions. The Delta v = 0 sequence bands of both electronic
   transitions, and the Delta v = -1 sequence bands of the A -> X band
   system were observed and rotationally analyzed. The nu = 1,2 and 3
   levels of the A(2)Pi state are perturbed systematically with the nu = 0,
   1 and 2 levels of the B-2 Sigma(+) state, respectively. Deperturbation
   of the A(2)Pi and B-2 Sigma(+) states was carried out using a
   Hamiltonian matrix that includes (2)Pi and (2)Sigma(+) matrix elements,
   as well as off-diagonal elements that couple the vibrational levels of
   the two states. Empirical band constants and Dunham-type parameters were
   obtained by least-squares fitting of the data. The equilibrium constants
   T-e, omega(e) and omega(e)x(e) of (CaH)-Ca-40 were determined to be
   14406.877(1), 1336.323(3) and 20.244(2) cm(-1) for the A(2)Pi state, and
   15756.265(2), 1296.517(3) and 26.121(1) cm(-1) for the B-2 Sigma(+)
   state, respectively. The equilibrium internuclear distances (r(e)) of
   the A(2)Pi and B-2 Sigma(+) states are 1.98212(1) and 1.95778(2)

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Number = {11},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Journal = PRA,
Year = {2009},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {We investigate the effects of a magnetic field on the dynamics of
   rotationally inelastic collisions of open-shell molecules ((2)Sigma,
   (3)Sigma, and (2)Pi) with closed-shell atoms. Our treatment makes use of
   the Fraunhofer model of matter wave scattering and its recent extension
   to collisions in electric {[}M. Lemeshko and B. Friedrich, J. Chem.
   Phys. 129, 024301 (2008)] and radiative fields {[}M. Lemeshko and B.
   Friedrich, Int. J. Mass. Spec. 280, 19 (2009)]. A magnetic field aligns
   the molecule in the space-fixed frame and thereby alters the effective
   shape of the diffraction target. This significantly affects the
   differential and integral scattering cross sections. We exemplify our
   treatment by evaluating the magnetic-field-dependent scattering
   characteristics of the He-CaH (X (2)Sigma(+)), He-O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)),
   and He-OH (X (2)Pi(Omega)) systems at thermal collision energies. Since
   the cross sections can be obtained for different orientations of the
   magnetic field with respect to the relative velocity vector, the model
   also offers predictions about the frontal-versus-lateral steric
   asymmetry of the collisions. The steric asymmetry is found to be almost
   negligible for the He-OH system, weak for the He-CaH collisions, and
   strong for the He-O(2). While odd Delta M transitions dominate the He-OH
   {[}J=3/2,f -> J('),e/f] integral cross sections in a magnetic field
   parallel to the relative velocity vector, even Delta M transitions
   prevail in the case of the He-CaH (X(2)Sigma(+)) and He-O(2) (X
   (3)Sigma(-)) collision systems. For the latter system, the magnetic
   field opens inelastic channels that are closed in the absence of the
   field. These involve the transitions N=1,J=0 -> N('), J(') with
   J(')=N(').},

   angle between the fields and show that rotating fields may induce and
   shift avoided crossings between the Zeeman levels of the rotationally
   ground and rotationally excited states of the molecule. The dynamics of
   molecular collisions are extremely sensitive to external fields near
   these avoided crossings and it is shown that molecular collisions may be
   controlled by varying both the strength and the relative orientation of
   the fields. The effects observed in this study are due to interactions
   of the isolated molecules with external fields so the conclusions should
   be relevant for collisions of molecules with other atoms or collisions
   of molecules with each other. This study demonstrates that electric
   fields may be used to enhance or suppress spin-rotation interactions in
   molecules. The spin-rotation interactions induce nonadiabatic couplings
   between states of different total spins in systems of two open-shell
   species and it is suggested that electric fields might be used for
   controlling nonadiabatic spin transitions and spin-forbidden chemical
   reactions of cold molecules in a magnetic trap. (C) 2007 American

Title = {Reaction dynamics of Ca(4s3d(1)D(2))+CH4 -> CaH(X-2 Sigma(+))+CH3:
   Reaction pathway and energy disposal for the CaH product},

Abstract = {The reaction pathway for Ca(4s3d D-1(2))+CH4-> CaH(X (2)Sigma(+))+CH3
   has been investigated by using a pump-probe technique in combination
   with potential-energy surface (PES) calculations. The nascent product
   distributions of CaH have been characterized with Boltzmann rotational
   temperatures of 1013 +/- 102 and 834 +/- 70 K for the v=0 and 1 levels,
   respectively, and a Boltzmann vibrational temperature of 1313 +/- 173 K.
   The rotational and vibrational energy partitions in CaH have been
   estimated to be 461 +/- 45 and 252 +/- 15 cm(-1), respectively.
   According to the PES calculations, the pathway favors an insertion
   mechanism. Ca(3 D-1(2)) approaches CH4 along an attractive potential
   surface in a C-2v (or C-s) symmetry and then the collision complex
   undergoes nonadiabatic transition to the reactive ground-state surface.
   An Arrhenius plot shows a potential-energy requirement of 2695 +/- 149
   cm(-1), which accounts for the endothermicity of 2930 cm(-1) for the
   reaction scheme. The Ca-C bond distance in the transition state
   structure is short enough to allow for tight orbital overlap between CaH
   and CH3. The strong coupling between the moieties renders the energy
   transfer sufficient from CaH into the CH3 radical. As compared to the
   Ca(4 P-1(1)) reaction, the dissociation lifetime of the intermediate
   complex with less excess energy is prolonged so as to cause much less
   vibrational energy disposal into CaH. (c) 2006 American Institute of

Title = {Charge-transfer cross sections in collisions of ground-state Ca and H+},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {73},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We have investigated collisions of Ca(4s(2)) with H+ in the energy range
   of 200 eV/u-10 keV/u using the semiclassical molecular-orbital
   close-coupling (MOCC) method with 18 coupled molecular states (11
   (1)Sigma(+) and seven (1)Pi(+) states) to determine charge-transfer
   cross sections. Except for the incoming channel 6 (1)Sigma(+), the
   molecular states all correspond to charge-transfer channels. Inclusion
   of Ca2+-H- is crucial in the configuration-interaction calculation for
   generating the molecular wave functions and potentials. Because of the
   Coulomb attraction, the state separating to Ca2+-H- creates many avoided
   crossings, even though at infinite separation it lies energetically
   above all other states that we included. Because of the avoided
   crossings between the incoming channel 6 (1)Sigma(+) and the
   energetically close charge-transfer channel 7 (1)Sigma(+) the
   charge-transfer interaction occurs at long range. This makes
   calculations of charge-transfer cross sections by the MOCC method very
   challenging. The total charge-transfer cross sections increase
   monotonically from 3.4x10(-15) cm(2) at 200 eV/u to 4.5x10(-15) cm(2) at
   10 keV/u. Charge transfer occurs mostly to the excited Ca+(5p) state in
   the entire energy range, which is the sum of the charge transfer to 7
   (1)Sigma(+) and 4 (1)Pi(+). It accounts for similar to 47\% of the total
   charge transfer cross sections at 200 eV/u. However, as the energy
   increases, transfer to Ca+(4d) increases, and at 10 keV/u the
   charge-transfer cross sections for Ca+(5p) and Ca+(4d) become
   comparable, each giving similar to 38\% of the total cross section.},

Abstract = {The reaction pathway and the nascent CaH product distribution in the
   reaction Ca(4s3d D-1)+H-2-->CaH(X(2)Sigma(+))+H are obtained using a
   pump-probe technique. The Ca atom is first prepared in the 3 D-1 state
   by a two-photon absorption, and then in brief time delay the
   laser-induced fluorescence of the reaction product CaH is monitored. The
   CaH(v=0,1) distributions appear to be single peaked, as characterized by
   Boltzmann rotational temperature of 807+/-38 K (v=0) and 684+/-77 K
   (v=1). The vibrational population ratio of CaH(v=0)/CaH(v=1) is
   determined to be 3.3+/-0.1, while the v=2 population is not detectable.
   The fractions of the available energy partitioning into rotation,
   vibration, and translation are estimated to be 0.36+/-0.05, 0.28+/-0.04,
   and 0.36+/-0.05, respectively. With the aid of the potential energy
   surfaces calculations, the current reaction should favor a near C-2v
   collision configuration. The temperature dependence measurement yields a
   positive slope, indicative of the reaction occurrence without any
   potential barrier. The colliding species are anticipated to follow an
   attractive 1B(2) (or 2A(')) surface and then transit nonadiabatically to
   the reactive ground state surface. (C) 2005 American Institute of

Abstract = {A variety of theoretical procedures, including the high-level ab initio
   methods G3, G3{[}CC](dir,full), and W2C//ACQ, have been used to predict
   the structures and heats of formation of several small
   calcium-containing molecules (CaH, CaH2, CaO, CaOH, Ca(OH)(2), CaF,
   CaF2, CaS, CaCl, and CaCl2) B3-LYP and CCSD(T) with both the
   (aug-)cc-pWCVQZ and (aug-)cc-pWCVQ+dZ basis sets are found to give
   molecular geometries that agree well with the experimental results. The
   CCSD(T)(riv)/(aug-)cc-pWCVQ+dZ results are found to be the most
   accurate, with a mean absolute deviation from experiment of just 0.008
   angstrom. Zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs) and thermochemical
   corrections are found to be relatively insensitive to the level of
   theory, except in the case of molecules with highly anharmonic
   calcium-centered bending modes (CaH2, Ca(OH)(2), CaF2, CaCl2), where
   special procedures need to be employed in order to obtain satisfactory
   results. Several potential improvements to the W2C method were
   investigated, most of which do not produce significant changes in the
   heats of formation. It was observed, however, that for CaO and CaS the
   scalar relativistic corrections are unexpectedly large and highly basis
   set dependent. In these cases, Douglas-Kroll CCSD(T)/(aug-)cc-pWCV5Z
   calculations appear to give a converged result. The G3{[}CC](dir,full)
   and best W2C-type heats of formation are both found generally to agree
   well with experimental values recommended in recent critical compendia.
   However, in some cases (CaO, Ca(OH)(2), and CaF2), they differ from one
   another by more than their predicted error margins. The available
   experimental data are not sufficiently precise to distinguish
   definitively between the two sets of results although, in general, when
   discrepancies exist the W2C heats of formation are lower in energy and
   tend to be in better agreement with experiment. In the case of CaCl, the
   W2C heat of formation (20.7 kJ mol(-1)) is similar to 20 kJ mol(-1)
   lower than the G3{[}CC](dir, full) result and most of the experimental
   data. Extensive investigation of possible refinements of the W2C method
   has failed to reveal any weaknesses that could account for this
   discrepancy. We therefore believe that the heat of formation of CaO is
   likely to lie closer to the more recent direct experimental
   determination of 27 kJ mol(-1) than to the value of similar to 40 kJ
   mol(-1) recommended in recent thermochemical reviews.},

Abstract = {We report the initial results of the Brown Dwarf Spectroscopic Survey
   Gravity Project to study gravity sensitive features as indicators of
   youth in brown dwarfs. Low-resolution (R similar to 2000) J-band and
   optical (R similar to 1000) observations using NIRSPEC and LRIS at the
   W. M. Keck Observatory reveal transitions of TiO, VO, K I, Na I, Cs I,
   Rb I, CaH, and FeH. By comparing these features in late-type giants and
   in old field dwarfs, we show that they are sensitive to the gravity (g =
   GM/R-2) of the object. Using low-gravity spectral signatures as age
   indicators, we observed and analyzed J-band and optical spectra of two
   young brown dwarfs, G196-3B (20-300 Myr) and KPNO Tau 4 (1-2 Myr) and
   two possible low-mass brown dwarfs in the sigma Orionis cluster (3-7
   Myr). We report the identification of the phi bands of TiO near 1.24 mum
   and the A-X band of VO near 1.18 mum together with extremely weak J-band
   lines of K I in KPNO Tau 4. This is the first detection of TiO and VO in
   the J band in a substellar-mass object. The optical spectrum of KPNO Tau
   4 exhibits weak K I and Na I lines, weak absorption by CaH, and strong
   VO bands, also signatures of a lower gravity atmosphere. G196-3B shows
   absorption features in both wavelength regions, like those of KPNO Tau
   4, suggesting that its age and mass are at the lower end of published
   estimates. Whereas sigma Ori 51 appears to be consistent with a young
   substellar object, sigma Ori 47 shows signatures of high gravity most
   closely resembling an old L1.5/L0 and cannot be a member of the sigma
   Orionis cluster.},

Abstract = {The nascent CaH product in the reaction Ca(4s4p
   P-1(1))+H-2-->CaH(X(2)Sigma(+))+H is obtained using a pump-probe
   technique. The CaH(v=0,1) distributions, with a population ratio of
   CaH(v=0)/CaH(v=1)=2.7+/-0.2, may be characterized by low Boltzmann
   rotational temperature. According to Arrhenius theory, the temperature
   dependence measurement yields a potential barrier of 3820+/-480 cm(-1)
   for the current reaction. As a result of the potential energy surfaces
   (PES) calculations, the reaction pathway favors a Ca insertion into the
   H-2 bond along a (near) C-2v geometric approach. As the H-2 bond is
   elongated, the configurational mixing between the orbital components of
   the 4p and nearby low-lying 3d state with the same symmetry makes
   significant the nonadiabatic transition between the 5A' and 2A' surface
   in the repulsive limbs. Therefore, the collision species are anticipated
   to track along the 5A' surface, then undergo nonadiabatic transition to
   the inner limb of the 2A' surface, and finally cross to the reactive 1A'
   surface. The observed energy barrier probably accounts for the energy
   requirement to surmount the repulsive hill in the entrance. The findings
   of the nascent CaH product distributions may be reasonably interpreted
   from the nature of the intermediate structure and lifetime after the
   2A'-1A' surface transition. The distinct product distributions between
   the Ca(4(1)P(1)) and Mg(3(1)P(1)) reactions with H-2 may also be
   realized with the aid of the PES calculations. (C) 2004 American

Title = {Collisional broadening of Mg, Sr, Ca and Na resonance lines by atomic
   hydrogen},
Journal = JPB,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {677-688},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {This paper compares different approaches used in the calculation of the
   broadening of spectral lines by H-atom collisions. Firstly, the validity
   of the semi-classical approach for the collision versus the quantum one
   is discussed. It is shown that, at the temperatures typical of stellar
   atmospheres (from 3000 to 10 000 K), a classical approach (with the
   advantage of reduced computation times) is sufficient. The dependence of
   the broadening constants on interatomic potentials is also studied. Two
   different approaches were used to derive these potentials: in the first
   approach, the interaction energy is determined by the usual methods of
   quantum chemistry. The second approach, developed by Anstee, Barklem and
   O'Mara (ABO potentials), is based on second-order perturbation theory.
   In the case of Mg-H, a hybrid potential obtained from ab initio values
   for the short distances and from the perturbation method in the
   asymptotic region was also tested. The results for the Na resonance line
   show that even significant differences in the potentials lead to
   relatively small changes in the calculated widths. From the comparison
   of the results for the Mg, Sr and Ca resonance lines, it appears that
   ABO potentials give results of the order of 8-20\% smaller than results
   from ab initio and hybrid potentials. This difference is attributed to
   the presence of an avoided ionic crossing in the upper singlet Sigma
   states that coincides roughly with the Weisskopf radius.},

Abstract = {In a search for the infrared spectra of gaseous CaH2 and SrH2, we

   X-2-->Sigma(+) ground electronic states. The new data were combined with
   the previous ground state data, obtained from diode laser infrared and
   pure rotational spectra, and the spectroscopic constants for v = 0 to 4

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {We present 6300-10100 Angstrom spectra for a sample of 13 T dwarfs
   observed using LRIS mounted on the Keck I 10 m Telescope. A variety of
   features are identified and analyzed, including pressure-broadened K I
   and Na I doublets; narrow Cs I and Rb I lines; weak CaH, CrH, and FeH
   bands; strong H(2)O absorption; and a possible weak CH(4) band. Halpha
   emission is detected in three of the T dwarfs, strong in the previously
   reported active T dwarf 2MASS 1237+6526 and weak in SDSS 1254-0122 and
   2MASS 1047+2124. None of the T dwarfs exhibit Li I absorption. Guided by
   the evolution of optical spectral features with near-infrared spectral
   type, we derive a parallel optical classification scheme, focusing on
   spectral types T5 to T8, anchored to select spectral standards. We find
   general agreement between optical and near-infrared types for nearly all
   the T dwarfs so far observed, including two earlier type T dwarfs,
   within our classification uncertainties (similar to1 subtype). These
   results suggest that competing gravity and temperature effects
   compensate for each other over the 0.6-2.5 mum spectral region. We
   identify one possible means of disentangling these effects by comparing
   the strength of the K I red wing to the 9250 Angstrom H(2)O band. One of
   our objects, 2MASS 0937+2931, exhibits a peculiar spectrum with a
   substantial red slope and relatively strong FeH absorption, both
   consequences of a metal-deficient atmosphere. On the basis of its
   near-infrared properties and substantial space motion, this object may
   be a thick disk or halo brown dwarf.},

Abstract = {The reaction pathway for Ca(4s4p P-1(1))+CH4-->CaH(X (2)Sigma(+))+CH3
   has been investigated by using the pump-probe technique in combination
   with potential energy surface (PES) calculations. The nascent product
   distributions of CaH have been found with a Boltzmann rotational
   temperature of 988+/-66 and 864+/-75 K for the v=0 and 1 levels,
   respectively, and a Boltzmann vibrational temperature of 1960+/-80 K.
   The rotational and vibrational energy partitions in CaH have been
   estimated to be 555+/-22 and 995+/-10 cm-1, respectively. According to
   the PES calculations, the pathway is found to favor an insertion
   mechanism. Ca(4 P-1(1)) approaches CH4 in C-2v or C-s symmetry and then
   the collision complex may undergo a series of surface transitions to the
   ground state surface with which the products correlate. The findings of
   low rotation and high vibration for CaH may be interpreted from two
   aspects. First, the Ca-C bond distance of the intermediate around the
   surface crossing region is 2.7-2.8 Angstrom, close to the equilibrium
   bond distance 2.349 Angstrom. The strong coupling of the moieties
   renders the energy transfer sufficient from CaH into the CH3 radical.
   Second, after the 2A(')-1 A(') surface transition, the HCaCH3
   intermediate with a small excess energy may be energetically stabilized.
   The long-lived collision complex may have enough time for energy
   randomization prior to flying apart. (C) 2003 American Institute of

Abstract = {Six (1)A(') potential energy surfaces of the Ca+H-2 system have been
   calculated using an effective-core potential and a core-polarization
   potential for Ca. Large configuration interactions were performed to
   ensure accurate energies and wave functions. The 2 (1)A(') surface, made
   from Ca(4s3d, D-1), has a very stable intermediate, and crosses with the
   ground state (1 (1)A(')) potential energy surface in C-2v geometry. A
   diabatic coupling between these two can result in the CaH product. Three
   potential surfaces originating from Ca(4s3d, D-1) and two potential
   surfaces originating from Ca(4s4p, P-1) are well separated at low energy
   region, suggesting that the reaction product CaH from the Ca(4s4p, P-1)
   state via nonadiabatic transition to the Ca(4s3d, D-1) surface is very
   unlikely. Other possible routes of producing CaH from the Ca(4s4p, P-1)
   state also appear quite improbable in the single collision process. The
   wave function analysis does not show any sign of electron transfer from
   the metal atom to the hydrogen molecule in the reactant stage, which
   implies that the harpooning model does not apply to this reaction. (C)

Abstract = {In a recent experiment {[}Weinstein et al., Nature 395, 148 (1998)] we
   magnetically trapped 10(8) ground-state calcium monohydride molecules,
   CaH(X(2)Sigma,upsilon{''} = 0,J{''} = 0). The molecules were prepared by
   laser ablation of a solid sample of CaH2 and loaded via thermalization
   with a cold (< 1 K) He-3 buffer gas. The magnetic trap was formed by
   superconducting coils arranged in the anti-Helmholtz configuration. The
   detection was done by laser fluorescence spectroscopy excited at 635 nm
   (in the B (2)Sigma, upsilon' = 0 - X (2)Sigma, upsilon{''} = 0 band) and
   detected at 692 nm (within the B, upsilon' = 0 - X,upsilon{''} = 1 band
   ). Both a photomultiplier tube and a CCD camera were used. Due to the
   thermalization of molecular rotation, only a transition from the lowest
   rotational state could be detected at zero field, N' = 1,J' = 3/2
   <--N{''} = 0,J{''} = 1/2. In the magnetic field this rotational
   transition splits into two features, one shifted towards lower and one
   towards higher frequencies. The measured shifts are linear in field
   strength and indicate a small difference (0.02 mu(B)) in the magnetic
   moments between the ground and excited states. Here we present a
   theoretical analysis of the observed magnetic shifts. These are
   identified as arising from a rotational perturbation of the B
   (2)Sigma,upsilon' = 0 state by a close-lying A (2)Pi,upsilon' = 1 state
   that lends the B state some of its A character. We find that the
   Hamiltonian can be well approximated by a 3 x 3 matrix built out of
   elements that connect states from within the Sigma-doublet and the
   (2)Pi(3/2) manifolds. The interaction parameter describing the Sigma-Pi
   coupling in the Zeeman Hamiltonian is determined from the observed
   shifts and the field-free molecular parameters of CaH given by Berg and

Abstract = {Highly accurate intensity constants for bands in diatomic-molecular
   spectra are now available in the RADEN data bank. This paper uses them
   to improve earlier systematics of D({[}R]) for A-X and related (0, 0)
   bands. The data are plotted to determine trends and wherever possible a
   heuristic equation is used to smooth them. Isoelectronic, dimer,
   hydride, and halide molecules are considered. Isoelectronic series
   containing a total of 28 molecules are plotted on \textbackslash{}Z(1)
   -Z(2)\textbackslash{}, the absolute difference of the atomic numbers of
   the two atoms in the molecules. The data become rapidly larger as
   rare-gas molecules are approached, behaving in a qualitative way like
   the internuclear separation r(e). Dimers from periods R = 2 and 3 behave
   similarly to each other, which is evidence for periodicity in diatomic
   data. The ad hoc function D-0({[}R]) = 0.33 + 0.054cosh{[}1.5(C - 4.2)],
   where 1 less than or equal to C less than or equal to 6 or 7 is the
   group number of either atom, describes their behavior reasonably well (C
   = 1, 2, 13,... 16 or 17 in the IUPAC scheme). For unipositive dimers,
   D+({[}R]) = 0.25 + 0.016cosh{[}(1.5(C - 5)] tracks the behavior as well
   but with one outlier (C-2(+)). 16 neutral hydride and 11 unipositive
   hydride molecular data show clear periodicity when plotted versus Z(1) +
   Z(2). The hydride data have nearly linear behavior, with increasing
   slopes for R = 2-4, when plotted on a function suggested by the 1/Z
   dependence of atomic oscillator strengths, with one major exception
   (CaH). The function is F-0 = {[}1/(n(e1) + n(e2))] - 0.14, where n(ei)
   is the valence-electron count in atom i. The unipositive hydride data
   have close to linear behavior, with increasing slopes for R = 2 and 3,
   when plotted on the similar function F+ = {[}1/(n(e1) + n(e2))] - 0.10,
   also with one major exception (BeH+). Clearly evident trends for halide
   molecules allow making qualitative estimates for two unknown transition
   strengths. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A Dunham treatment of an effective Hamiltonian for diatomic molecules in
   (2)Sigma states that includes contributions of the Born-Oppenheimer
   breakdown has yielded an expression for vibrational-rotational energy by
   an expansion in powers of (nu + 1/2)(i) {[}N(N + l)](j-k)(N'/2)(k),
   where N' is N for the J = N + 1/2 spin-doublet state and -(N + 1) for
   the J = N - 1/2 state and k = 0, 1,..., j. Analytic expressions for the
   expansion coefficients Y-ijk{*}(upsilon J) provide a potential model
   appropriate for the spectral fits for molecules in (2)Sigma states. The
   expansion coefficients Y--(ij0){*}(upsilon J) for the k = 0 terms are
   exactly the same as the Y-ij{*}(upsilon N) coefficients given for
   (1)Sigma states, the Dunham coefficients Y-ij modified by the
   contributions of the Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, provided that a spin
   contribution originating from off-diagonal electronic corrections of the
   electronic part of the spin-orbit interaction can be ignored.
   Spin-rotation energy is given by the terms with coefficients
   Y-ijk{*}(upsilon J) (k greater than or equal to 1). There are no
   Y-ijk{*}(upsilon J) (k greater than or equal to 2) terms in the

   potential model is applied to the reported vibrational-rotational
   spectra of CaH and all spectral lines of (CaH)-Ca-40 and (CaD)-Ca-40

   facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions(6);
   improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also,
   ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of
   elementary particles(7). But although laser cooling (in the case of
   alkali metals(1,8,9)) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case
   of hydrogen(10,11)) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently
   to permit their loading into magnetic trays, such techniques are not
   applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal
   energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by
   these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading
   technique(12) based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and
   have used it to trap atomic chromium and europium(13,14). Here we apply
   this technique to magnetically trap a molecular species-calcium
   monohydride (CaH). We use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number
   of trapped molecules and their temperature, and set upper bounds on the
   cross-sectional areas of collisional relaxation processes. The
   technique should he applicable to many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.},

Abstract = {The ground (1 (2) Sigma(+), X) and excited electronic states, 1 (2) Pi

   Delta, of CaH are studied by ab initio calculation, with extensive
   configuration interactions. Calculated spectroscopic constants, in
   particular, the excitation energies, are more accurate than in previous
   calculations and agree well with the currently available experimental
   data. This work confirms the existence of a single vibrational level,
   v'=4, bound to the second well of the B state calculated from the
   experimental data by Martin {[}J. Chem. Phys. 88, 1797 (1988)].
   Calculated oscillator strengths for the B-X and D-X show irregular band
   structures because of multiple avoided crossings of the potential
   energy curves. The avoided crossing between the D and C states should
   be taken into account to explain the apparent perturbations observed in
   the experimental spectra. The wave functions, dipole moments, and
   transition dipole moments of these states are discussed in detail. (C)

   The six hyperfine components of the N = 0 --> 1 rotational transition of

   accuracy of +/- 100 kHz. The main hyperfine lines originating in the N =

   detected. Spectroscopic constants were determined for both radicals from
   a non-linear least squares fit to the data, using a 2SIGMA Hamiltonian.
   These measurements constitute the first laboratory observation of CaH at
   high spectral resolution, and are essential to the detection of this
   radical in interstellar space.},

Abstract = {Quasirelativistic and nonrelativistic 10-valence-electron
   pseudopotentials for Ca, Sr, and Ba are presented.  Results of
   calculations with 6s6p5d basis sets for MH, MH+, and MH2 are compared
   with all-electron and 2-valence-electron pseudopotential calculations
   with and without core-polarization potentials.  The 10-valence-electron
   pseudopotential approach agrees well with all-electron calculations.  It
   circumvents problems for the 2-valence-electron pseudopotentials arising
   from an incomplete separation of valence and subvalence shells in polar
   molecular systems due to strongly contracted occupied (n - 1)-d
   orbitals.  All higher-level calculations show SrH2 and BaH2 to be bent
   with angles of approximately 140-degrees and 120-degrees, respectively,
   while CaH2 is linear with a flat potential-energy surface for the
   bending motion.  The use of a core-polarization potential together with
   the 2-valence-electron pseudopotential approach allows an investigation
   of the relative importance of core-polarization vs direct d-orbital
   bonding participation as reasons for the bent structures.  The
   calculations strongly suggest that both contribute to the bending in
   SrH2 and BaH2.  Even at the Hartree-Fock level of theory
   10-valence-electron pseudopotential calculations given reasonable angles
   when the potential-energy surface is not exceedingly flat, and only
   moderately contracted basis sets including both compact d functions and
   diffuse p functions are used.  The effect of core-valence correlation
   and the importance of f functions also are discussed.},

Abstract = {A detailed investigation is presented of the collisional removal of
   electronically excited calcium atoms, Ca{[}4s4p(3P(J))], 1.888 eV above
   its 4s2(1S(o)) ground state, with n-butane at elevated temperatures in a
   slow-flow system, kinetically equivalent to a static system.
   Ca(4(3)P(J)) was generated by pulsed dye-laser excitation of calcium
   vapour at lambda = 657.3 nm {[}Ca(4(3)P1) <-- Ca(4(1)S(o))] and
   monitored by time-resolved atomic fluorescence at the resonance
   wavelength over timescales during which Boltzmann equilibration had
   taken place with the 3P(J) spin-orbit manifold.  Absolute second-order
   rate constants for the collisional removal of Ca(4(3)P(J)) by butane
   were measured over the temperature range 750-923 K, yielding the
   following Arrhenius form:  k(R) = (3.5-1.8(+3.6) x 10(-9) exp(-58.7 +/-
   5.0 kJ mol-1/RT) cm3 molecule-1 s-1
   The results are compared with analogous data derived from our previous
   investigations on the collisional removal of Mg(3(3)P(J)) by various
   hydrocarbons.  Molecular chemiluminescence for the system CaH(A
   2-PI-X2-SIGMA+) was also monitored in the time domain following
   excitation of Ca(4(3)P(J)) and shown to arise from electronic energy
   transfer from Ca(4(3)P(J)) to ground-state CaH(X2-SIGMA+) both from its
   bi-exponential time dependence and the observation of CaH(X2-SIGMA+),
   generated in the reaction, by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).
   CaH(X2-SIGMA+) was also detected by LIF from the reaction of
   Ca(4(1)S(o)) in the flow, and the source of this is discussed.  These
   CaH(A-X) chemiluminescence profiles which provide a spectroscopic marker
   for Ca(4(3)P(J)) in this type of system, coupled with the LIF
   observations on CaH(X) and constituting, to the best of our knowledge,
   the first observation of its type, are compared with analogous
   observations reported previously where molecular chemiluminescence from
   CaO is employed as a spectroscopic marker for Ca(4(3)P(J)) with
   oxidising reactants.},
