Title = {{Electronic, structural and vibrational properties of calcium monohydride}},
Journal = {PS},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{95}},
Abstract = {{Thanks to the quantum chemistry approach, a global study has been
   performed for numerous excited electronic states of calcium monohydride
   denoted CaH. The CaH molecule is considered as a three effective
   electrons system. It was treated on the Multireference Configuration
   Interaction level of theory using the effective core potentials
   including Core Polarization Potential operator with large Gaussian basis
   sets. Hence, the Potential Energy Curves (PECs) for (2,4)Sigma(+),
   (2,4)Pi and (2,4)Delta symmetries have been determined. These curves
   exhibit an attracted behavior in the avoided crossings region due to the
   strong interactions between Ca and H. Then, their relative spectroscopic
   constants have been calculated by solving the vibrational Schrodinger
   equation using the PECs. Finaly, the vibrational properties and the
   electric dipole moments of CaH have been investigated and analyzed in
   detail.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, electron-propagator methods are applied to the calculation
   of the ionization potential and vertical excitation energies for several
   Rydberg series of the CaH molecule. The present calculations cover more
   highly excited states than those previously reported. In particular,
   excitation energies for ns (n > 5), np (n > 5), nd (n > 4) and of
   Rydberg states are given. Oscillator strengths for electronic
   transitions involving Rydberg states of CaH, as well as photoionization
   cross sections for Rydberg channels, also have been determined by using
   the Molecular Quantum Defect Orbital approach. Good agreement has been
   found with the scarce comparative data that are available for oscillator
   strengths. To our knowledge, predictions of photoionization cross
   sections from the outermost orbital of CaH are made here for the first
   time. A Cooper minimum and mixed atomic orbital character in some of the
   Dyson orbitals are among the novel features of these present
   calculations. }},

Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond

   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,

   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the

Abstract = {We investigate the effects of a magnetic field on the dynamics of

   Phys. 129, 024301 (2008)] and radiative fields {[}M. Lemeshko and B.
   Friedrich, Int. J. Mass. Spec. 280, 19 (2009)]. A magnetic field aligns
   the molecule in the space-fixed frame and thereby alters the effective
   shape of the diffraction target. This significantly affects the
   differential and integral scattering cross sections. We exemplify our
   treatment by evaluating the magnetic-field-dependent scattering
   characteristics of the He-CaH (X (2)Sigma(+)), He-O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)),
   and He-OH (X (2)Pi(Omega)) systems at thermal collision energies. Since
   the cross sections can be obtained for different orientations of the
   magnetic field with respect to the relative velocity vector, the model
   also offers predictions about the frontal-versus-lateral steric
   asymmetry of the collisions. The steric asymmetry is found to be almost
   negligible for the He-OH system, weak for the He-CaH collisions, and
   strong for the He-O(2). While odd Delta M transitions dominate the He-OH
   {[}J=3/2,f -> J('),e/f] integral cross sections in a magnetic field

   electron clouds on the ions. These simple models are compared with more
   quantitative models, allowing the development of sophisticated

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {127},
Abstract = {The authors present a detailed study of low-temperature collisions
   between CaD molecules and He atoms in superimposed electric and magnetic
   fields with arbitrary orientations. Electric fields do not interact with
   the electron spin of the molecules directly but modify their rotational
   structure and, consequently, the spin-rotation interactions. The authors
   examine molecular Stark and Zeeman energy levels as functions of the
   angle between the fields and show that rotating fields may induce and
   shift avoided crossings between the Zeeman levels of the rotationally
   ground and rotationally excited states of the molecule. The dynamics of
   molecular collisions are extremely sensitive to external fields near
   these avoided crossings and it is shown that molecular collisions may be
   controlled by varying both the strength and the relative orientation of
   the fields. The effects observed in this study are due to interactions
   of the isolated molecules with external fields so the conclusions should
   be relevant for collisions of molecules with other atoms or collisions
   of molecules with each other. This study demonstrates that electric
   fields may be used to enhance or suppress spin-rotation interactions in
   molecules. The spin-rotation interactions induce nonadiabatic couplings
   between states of different total spins in systems of two open-shell
   species and it is suggested that electric fields might be used for
   controlling nonadiabatic spin transitions and spin-forbidden chemical
   reactions of cold molecules in a magnetic trap. },

Abstract = {The reaction pathway for Ca(4s3d D-1(2))+CH4-> CaH(X (2)Sigma(+))+CH3
   has been investigated by using a pump-probe technique in combination
   with potential-energy surface (PES) calculations. The nascent product
   distributions of CaH have been characterized with Boltzmann rotational
   temperatures of 1013 +/- 102 and 834 +/- 70 K for the v=0 and 1 levels,
   respectively, and a Boltzmann vibrational temperature of 1313 +/- 173 K.
   The rotational and vibrational energy partitions in CaH have been
   estimated to be 461 +/- 45 and 252 +/- 15 cm(-1), respectively.
   According to the PES calculations, the pathway favors an insertion
   mechanism. Ca(3 D-1(2)) approaches CH4 along an attractive potential
   surface in a C-2v (or C-s) symmetry and then the collision complex
   undergoes nonadiabatic transition to the reactive ground-state surface.
   An Arrhenius plot shows a potential-energy requirement of 2695 +/- 149
   cm(-1), which accounts for the endothermicity of 2930 cm(-1) for the
   reaction scheme. The Ca-C bond distance in the transition state
   structure is short enough to allow for tight orbital overlap between CaH
   and CH3. The strong coupling between the moieties renders the energy
   transfer sufficient from CaH into the CH3 radical. As compared to the
   Ca(4 P-1(1)) reaction, the dissociation lifetime of the intermediate
   complex with less excess energy is prolonged so as to cause much less
   vibrational energy disposal into CaH.},

Title = {{Charge-transfer cross sections in collisions of ground-state Ca and H$^+$}},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {73},
Abstract = {We have investigated collisions of Ca(4s(2)) with H+ in the energy range
   of 200 eV/u-10 keV/u using the semiclassical molecular-orbital
   close-coupling (MOCC) method with 18 coupled molecular states (11
   (1)Sigma(+) and seven (1)Pi(+) states) to determine charge-transfer
   cross sections. Except for the incoming channel 6 (1)Sigma(+), the
   molecular states all correspond to charge-transfer channels. Inclusion
   of Ca2+-H- is crucial in the configuration-interaction calculation for
   generating the molecular wave functions and potentials. Because of the
   Coulomb attraction, the state separating to Ca2+-H- creates many avoided
   crossings, even though at infinite separation it lies energetically
   above all other states that we included. Because of the avoided
   crossings between the incoming channel 6 (1)Sigma(+) and the
   energetically close charge-transfer channel 7 (1)Sigma(+) the
   charge-transfer interaction occurs at long range. This makes
   calculations of charge-transfer cross sections by the MOCC method very
   challenging. The total charge-transfer cross sections increase
   monotonically from 3.4x10(-15) cm(2) at 200 eV/u to 4.5x10(-15) cm(2) at
   10 keV/u. Charge transfer occurs mostly to the excited Ca+(5p) state in
   the entire energy range, which is the sum of the charge transfer to 7
   (1)Sigma(+) and 4 (1)Pi(+). It accounts for similar to 47\% of the total
   charge transfer cross sections at 200 eV/u. However, as the energy
   increases, transfer to Ca+(4d) increases, and at 10 keV/u the
   charge-transfer cross sections for Ca+(5p) and Ca+(4d) become
   comparable, each giving similar to 38\% of the total cross section.},

Abstract = {The reaction pathway and the nascent CaH product distribution in the

   laser-induced fluorescence of the reaction product CaH is monitored. The
   CaH(v=0,1) distributions appear to be single peaked, as characterized by
   Boltzmann rotational temperature of 807+/-38 K (v=0) and 684+/-77 K
   (v=1). The vibrational population ratio of CaH(v=0)/CaH(v=1) is
   determined to be 3.3+/-0.1, while the v=2 population is not detectable.

   and 0.36+/-0.05, respectively. With the aid of the potential energy
   surfaces calculations, the current reaction should favor a near C-2v
   collision configuration. The temperature dependence measurement yields a
   positive slope, indicative of the reaction occurrence without any
   potential barrier. The colliding species are anticipated to follow an

Pages = {9156-9168},
Abstract = {A variety of theoretical procedures, including the high-level ab initio
   methods G3, G3{[}CC](dir,full), and W2C//ACQ, have been used to predict
   the structures and heats of formation of several small
   calcium-containing molecules (CaH, CaH2, CaO, CaOH, Ca(OH)(2), CaF,
   CaF2, CaS, CaCl, and CaCl2) B3-LYP and CCSD(T) with both the
   (aug-)cc-pWCVQZ and (aug-)cc-pWCVQ+dZ basis sets are found to give
   molecular geometries that agree well with the experimental results. The
   CCSD(T)(riv)/(aug-)cc-pWCVQ+dZ results are found to be the most
   accurate, with a mean absolute deviation from experiment of just 0.008
   angstrom. Zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs) and thermochemical
   corrections are found to be relatively insensitive to the level of
   theory, except in the case of molecules with highly anharmonic
   calcium-centered bending modes (CaH2, Ca(OH)(2), CaF2, CaCl2), where
   special procedures need to be employed in order to obtain satisfactory
   results. Several potential improvements to the W2C method were
   investigated, most of which do not produce significant changes in the
   heats of formation. It was observed, however, that for CaO and CaS the
   scalar relativistic corrections are unexpectedly large and highly basis
   set dependent. In these cases, Douglas-Kroll CCSD(T)/(aug-)cc-pWCV5Z
   calculations appear to give a converged result. The G3{[}CC](dir,full)
   and best W2C-type heats of formation are both found generally to agree
   well with experimental values recommended in recent critical compendia.
   However, in some cases (CaO, Ca(OH)(2), and CaF2), they differ from one
   another by more than their predicted error margins. The available
   experimental data are not sufficiently precise to distinguish
   definitively between the two sets of results although, in general, when
   discrepancies exist the W2C heats of formation are lower in energy and
   tend to be in better agreement with experiment. In the case of CaCl, the
   W2C heat of formation (20.7 kJ mol(-1)) is similar to 20 kJ mol(-1)
   lower than the G3{[}CC](dir, full) result and most of the experimental
   data. Extensive investigation of possible refinements of the W2C method
   has failed to reveal any weaknesses that could account for this
   discrepancy. We therefore believe that the heat of formation of CaO is
   likely to lie closer to the more recent direct experimental
   determination of 27 kJ mol(-1) than to the value of similar to 40 kJ
   mol(-1) recommended in recent thermochemical reviews.},

Abstract = {We report the initial results of the Brown Dwarf Spectroscopic Survey

   optical (R similar to 1000) observations using NIRSPEC and LRIS at the
   W. M. Keck Observatory reveal transitions of TiO, VO, K I, Na I, Cs I,
   Rb I, CaH, and FeH. By comparing these features in late-type giants and
   in old field dwarfs, we show that they are sensitive to the gravity (g =
   GM/R-2) of the object. Using low-gravity spectral signatures as age
   indicators, we observed and analyzed J-band and optical spectra of two
   young brown dwarfs, G196-3B (20-300 Myr) and KPNO Tau 4 (1-2 Myr) and
   two possible low-mass brown dwarfs in the sigma Orionis cluster (3-7
   Myr). We report the identification of the phi bands of TiO near 1.24 mum
   and the A-X band of VO near 1.18 mum together with extremely weak J-band
   lines of K I in KPNO Tau 4. This is the first detection of TiO and VO in
   the J band in a substellar-mass object. The optical spectrum of KPNO Tau
   4 exhibits weak K I and Na I lines, weak absorption by CaH, and strong
   VO bands, also signatures of a lower gravity atmosphere. G196-3B shows
   absorption features in both wavelength regions, like those of KPNO Tau
   4, suggesting that its age and mass are at the lower end of published
   estimates. Whereas sigma Ori 51 appears to be consistent with a young
   substellar object, sigma Ori 47 shows signatures of high gravity most
   closely resembling an old L1.5/L0 and cannot be a member of the sigma

Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {The nascent CaH product in the reaction Ca(4s4p
   P-1(1))+H-2-->CaH(X(2)Sigma(+))+H is obtained using a pump-probe
   technique. The CaH(v=0,1) distributions, with a population ratio of
   CaH(v=0)/CaH(v=1)=2.7+/-0.2, may be characterized by low Boltzmann
   rotational temperature. According to Arrhenius theory, the temperature
   dependence measurement yields a potential barrier of 3820+/-480 cm(-1)
   for the current reaction. As a result of the potential energy surfaces
   (PES) calculations, the reaction pathway favors a Ca insertion into the
   H-2 bond along a (near) C-2v geometric approach. As the H-2 bond is
   elongated, the configurational mixing between the orbital components of
   the 4p and nearby low-lying 3d state with the same symmetry makes
   significant the nonadiabatic transition between the 5A' and 2A' surface
   in the repulsive limbs. Therefore, the collision species are anticipated
   to track along the 5A' surface, then undergo nonadiabatic transition to
   the inner limb of the 2A' surface, and finally cross to the reactive 1A'
   surface. The observed energy barrier probably accounts for the energy
   requirement to surmount the repulsive hill in the entrance. The findings
   of the nascent CaH product distributions may be reasonably interpreted
   from the nature of the intermediate structure and lifetime after the
   2A'-1A' surface transition. The distinct product distributions between
   the Ca(4(1)P(1)) and Mg(3(1)P(1)) reactions with H-2 may also be

Journal = JPB,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {677-688},
Abstract = {This paper compares different approaches used in the calculation of the
   broadening of spectral lines by H-atom collisions. Firstly, the validity
   of the semi-classical approach for the collision versus the quantum one
   is discussed. It is shown that, at the temperatures typical of stellar
   atmospheres (from 3000 to 10 000 K), a classical approach (with the
   advantage of reduced computation times) is sufficient. The dependence of
   the broadening constants on interatomic potentials is also studied. Two
   different approaches were used to derive these potentials: in the first
   approach, the interaction energy is determined by the usual methods of
   quantum chemistry. The second approach, developed by Anstee, Barklem and
   O'Mara (ABO potentials), is based on second-order perturbation theory.
   In the case of Mg-H, a hybrid potential obtained from ab initio values
   for the short distances and from the perturbation method in the
   asymptotic region was also tested. The results for the Na resonance line
   show that even significant differences in the potentials lead to
   relatively small changes in the calculated widths. From the comparison
   of the results for the Mg, Sr and Ca resonance lines, it appears that
   ABO potentials give results of the order of 8-20\% smaller than results
   from ab initio and hybrid potentials. This difference is attributed to
   the presence of an avoided ionic crossing in the upper singlet Sigma
   states that coincides roughly with the Weisskopf radius.},

   The spectral features exhibit a small splitting that is attributed to
   proton magnetic hyperfine interaction in the X(2)Sigma(+) (v = 0) state.
   The energy levels of the A(2)Pi(v = 0) vibronic state were modeled using
   a traditional ``effective{''} Hamiltonian approach, whereas those for
   the interacting A(2)Pi(v = 1)/B(2)Sigma(+)(v = 0) vibronic levels were
   modeled by augmenting the traditional effective Hamiltonian with terms

Pages = {510-524},
Abstract = {We present 6300-10100 Angstrom spectra for a sample of 13 T dwarfs
   observed using LRIS mounted on the Keck I 10 m Telescope. A variety of
   features are identified and analyzed, including pressure-broadened K I
   and Na I doublets; narrow Cs I and Rb I lines; weak CaH, CrH, and FeH
   bands; strong H(2)O absorption; and a possible weak CH(4) band. Halpha
   emission is detected in three of the T dwarfs, strong in the previously
   reported active T dwarf 2MASS 1237+6526 and weak in SDSS 1254-0122 and
   2MASS 1047+2124. None of the T dwarfs exhibit Li I absorption. Guided by
   the evolution of optical spectral features with near-infrared spectral
   type, we derive a parallel optical classification scheme, focusing on
   spectral types T5 to T8, anchored to select spectral standards. We find
   general agreement between optical and near-infrared types for nearly all
   the T dwarfs so far observed, including two earlier type T dwarfs,
   within our classification uncertainties (similar to1 subtype). These
   results suggest that competing gravity and temperature effects
   compensate for each other over the 0.6-2.5 mum spectral region. We
   identify one possible means of disentangling these effects by comparing
   the strength of the K I red wing to the 9250 Angstrom H(2)O band. One of
   our objects, 2MASS 0937+2931, exhibits a peculiar spectrum with a
   substantial red slope and relatively strong FeH absorption, both
   consequences of a metal-deficient atmosphere. On the basis of its
   near-infrared properties and substantial space motion, this object may
   be a thick disk or halo brown dwarf.},

Abstract = {The reaction pathway for Ca(4s4p P-1(1))+CH4-->CaH(X (2)Sigma(+))+CH3
   has been investigated by using the pump-probe technique in combination
   with potential energy surface (PES) calculations. The nascent product
   distributions of CaH have been found with a Boltzmann rotational
   temperature of 988+/-66 and 864+/-75 K for the v=0 and 1 levels,
   respectively, and a Boltzmann vibrational temperature of 1960+/-80 K.
   The rotational and vibrational energy partitions in CaH have been
   estimated to be 555+/-22 and 995+/-10 cm-1, respectively. According to
   the PES calculations, the pathway is found to favor an insertion
   mechanism. Ca(4 P-1(1)) approaches CH4 in C-2v or C-s symmetry and then
   the collision complex may undergo a series of surface transitions to the
   ground state surface with which the products correlate. The findings of
   low rotation and high vibration for CaH may be interpreted from two
   aspects. First, the Ca-C bond distance of the intermediate around the
   surface crossing region is 2.7-2.8 Angstrom, close to the equilibrium
   bond distance 2.349 Angstrom. The strong coupling of the moieties
   renders the energy transfer sufficient from CaH into the CH3 radical.
   Second, after the 2A(')-1 A(') surface transition, the HCaCH3
   intermediate with a small excess energy may be energetically stabilized.
   The long-lived collision complex may have enough time for energy
   randomization prior to flying apart. },

   diabatic coupling between these two can result in the CaH product. Three
   potential surfaces originating from Ca(4s3d, D-1) and two potential
   surfaces originating from Ca(4s4p, P-1) are well separated at low energy

   superconducting coils arranged in the anti-Helmholtz configuration. The
   detection was done by laser fluorescence spectroscopy excited at 635 nm

   detected at 692 nm (within the B, upsilon' = 0 - X,upsilon{''} = 1 band

   moments between the ground and excited states. Here we present a
   theoretical analysis of the observed magnetic shifts. These are
   identified as arising from a rotational perturbation of the B
   (2)Sigma,upsilon' = 0 state by a close-lying A (2)Pi,upsilon' = 1 state
   that lends the B state some of its A character. We find that the
   Hamiltonian can be well approximated by a 3 x 3 matrix built out of
   elements that connect states from within the Sigma-doublet and the
   (2)Pi(3/2) manifolds. The interaction parameter describing the Sigma-Pi
   coupling in the Zeeman Hamiltonian is determined from the observed
   shifts and the field-free molecular parameters of CaH given by Berg and

Title = {Systematics of diatomic molecular transition moments},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {1999},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {765-774},
Abstract = {Highly accurate intensity constants for bands in diatomic-molecular
   spectra are now available in the RADEN data bank. This paper uses them
   to improve earlier systematics of D({[}R]) for A-X and related (0, 0)
   bands. The data are plotted to determine trends and wherever possible a
   heuristic equation is used to smooth them. Isoelectronic, dimer,
   hydride, and halide molecules are considered. Isoelectronic series
   containing a total of 28 molecules are plotted on \textbackslash{}Z(1)
   -Z(2)\textbackslash{}, the absolute difference of the atomic numbers of
   the two atoms in the molecules. The data become rapidly larger as
   rare-gas molecules are approached, behaving in a qualitative way like
   the internuclear separation r(e). Dimers from periods R = 2 and 3 behave
   similarly to each other, which is evidence for periodicity in diatomic
   data. The ad hoc function D-0({[}R]) = 0.33 + 0.054cosh{[}1.5(C - 4.2)],
   where 1 less than or equal to C less than or equal to 6 or 7 is the
   group number of either atom, describes their behavior reasonably well (C
   = 1, 2, 13,... 16 or 17 in the IUPAC scheme). For unipositive dimers,
   D+({[}R]) = 0.25 + 0.016cosh{[}(1.5(C - 5)] tracks the behavior as well
   but with one outlier (C-2(+)). 16 neutral hydride and 11 unipositive
   hydride molecular data show clear periodicity when plotted versus Z(1) +
   Z(2). The hydride data have nearly linear behavior, with increasing
   slopes for R = 2-4, when plotted on a function suggested by the 1/Z
   dependence of atomic oscillator strengths, with one major exception
   (CaH). The function is F-0 = {[}1/(n(e1) + n(e2))] - 0.14, where n(ei)
   is the valence-electron count in atom i. The unipositive hydride data
   have close to linear behavior, with increasing slopes for R = 2 and 3,
   when plotted on the similar function F+ = {[}1/(n(e1) + n(e2))] - 0.10,
   also with one major exception (BeH+). Clearly evident trends for halide
   molecules allow making qualitative estimates for two unknown transition
   strengths. },

Abstract = {A Dunham treatment of an effective Hamiltonian for diatomic molecules in

   breakdown has yielded an expression for vibrational-rotational energy by
   an expansion in powers of (nu + 1/2)(i) {[}N(N + l)](j-k)(N'/2)(k),
   where N' is N for the J = N + 1/2 spin-doublet state and -(N + 1) for
   the J = N - 1/2 state and k = 0, 1,..., j. Analytic expressions for the
   expansion coefficients Y-ijk{*}(upsilon J) provide a potential model
   appropriate for the spectral fits for molecules in (2)Sigma states. The
   expansion coefficients Y--(ij0){*}(upsilon J) for the k = 0 terms are
   exactly the same as the Y-ij{*}(upsilon N) coefficients given for
   (1)Sigma states, the Dunham coefficients Y-ij modified by the
   contributions of the Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, provided that a spin
   contribution originating from off-diagonal electronic corrections of the
   electronic part of the spin-orbit interaction can be ignored.
   Spin-rotation energy is given by the terms with coefficients

Abstract = {Recent advances(1-5) in the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling

   facilitate the study of ultracold molecular physics and collisions(6);
   improvements in molecular spectroscopy could be anticipated. Also,
   ultracold molecules could aid the search for electric dipole moments of
   elementary particles(7). But although laser cooling (in the case of
   alkali metals(1,8,9)) and cryogenic surface thermalization (in the case
   of hydrogen(10,11)) are currently used to cool some atoms sufficiently
   to permit their loading into magnetic trays, such techniques are not
   applicable to molecules, because of the latter's complex internal
   energy-level structure. (Indeed, most atoms have resisted trapping by
   these techniques.) We have reported a more general loading
   technique(12) based on elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas, and
   have used it to trap atomic chromium and europium(13,14). Here we apply
   this technique to magnetically trap a molecular species-calcium
   monohydride (CaH). We use Zeeman spectroscopy to determine the number
   of trapped molecules and their temperature, and set upper bounds on the
   cross-sectional areas of collisional relaxation processes. The
   technique should he applicable to many paramagnetic molecules and atoms.},

   from an incomplete separation of valence and subvalence shells in polar
   molecular systems due to strongly contracted occupied (n - 1)-d

   of the relative importance of core-polarization vs direct d-orbital

   CaH(A-X) chemiluminescence profiles which provide a spectroscopic marker
   for Ca(4(3)P(J)) in this type of system, coupled with the LIF
   observations on CaH(X) and constituting, to the best of our knowledge,
   the first observation of its type, are compared with analogous
   observations reported previously where molecular chemiluminescence from
   CaO is employed as a spectroscopic marker for Ca(4(3)P(J)) with
   oxidising reactants.},
