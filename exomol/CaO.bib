Abstract = {We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium
   sulfide and magnesium sulfide and the tentative detection of calcium
   monoxide in the interstellar medium toward the Galactic center molecular
   cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0 +/- 1.1) x
   1010 cm-2, (6.0 +/- 0.6) x 1010 cm-2, and (2.0 +/- 0.5) x 1010 cm-2,
   respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to
   H2 of (3.7 +/- 1.0) x 10-13, (4.4 +/- 0.8) x 10-13, and (1.5 +/- 0.4) x
   10-13, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg-, and
   Ca-bearing species toward this source but none of them have been
   detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We
   discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these
   molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we
   compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules
   with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are
   much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the
   general trend found in the ratios between other nonmetal-oxygen- and
   sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthens the idea that sulfur
   may be a little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the
   low-velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of
   material from dust grains.},

Abstract = {Laser induced fluorescence spectra for jet-cooled CaO have been used to
   examine the higher vibrational levels of the A'(1)Pi(X sigma pi(-1))
   state (v = 10-17) and the v = 6-8 vibrational levels of the C-1
   Sigma(+)(B sigma sigma(-1)) state. A perturbation of v = 17 of the A'
   state was evident, caused by a spin-orbit mediated interaction with the
   b(3)Sigma(+)(Omega = 1)(X sigma sigma(-1)) v = 14 level. Ro-vibrational
   constants for the A' state were obtained by fitting to the data for
   nominally unperturbed levels. The average radiative lifetime for the
   A'(1)Pi(X sigma pi(-1)) state v = 10-17 levels was 2.6 mu s, with no
   measurable dependence on v. This was consistent with the theoretical
   prediction of a relatively small transition dipole moment for the
   A'(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+) band system.
   A homogeneous perturbation of the C-1 Sigma(+)(B sigma sigma(-1)) v = 7
   level was examined by means of dispersed laser induced fluorescence
   (DLIF) and radiative lifetime measurements. The DLIF spectra clearly
   demonstrate that the perturbing Omega = 0(+) state is a component of a
   triplet state. Intense transitions from this state to the a(3)Pi(0(+))(X
   sigma pi(-1)) state were observed. Configurational arguments are
   presented that support assignment of the perturbing state as the v = 12
   vibrational level of the previously unobserved g(3)Pi(0(+))(B sigma
   pi(-1)) state.},

   shape of FeO orange bands. Using a simple model the CaO column density

   (5 +/- 2) x 10(14) cm(-2) by a comparison of the present CaO spectra

Title = {{Constraints on the exosphere of CoRoT-7b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {525},
pages = {A24},
Abstract = {Context. The small radius and high density of CoRoT-7b implies that this
   transiting planet belongs to a different species than all transiting
   planets previously found. Current models suggest that this is the first
   transiting rocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the
   planet orbits a solar-like star at a distance of only 4.5 R-{*}, it is
   expected that material released from its surface may then form an
   exosphere.
   Aims. We constrain the properties of the exosphere by observing the
   planet in-and out-of-transit. Detecting the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would
   for the first time allow us to study the material originating in the
   surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan the entire optical
   spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing
   particularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury and Io
   in our solar system.
   Methods. Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to be
   narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By
   subtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and
   absorption lines originating in the exosphere of CoRoT-7b.
   Results. In the first step, we focus on Ca I, Ca II, and Na, because
   these lines have been detected in Mercury. Since the signal-to-noise
   ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as 300, we derive firm upper
   limits for the flux-range between 1.6 x 10(-18) and 3.2 x 10(-18) W
   m(-2). For CaO, we find an upper limit of 10(-17) W m(-2). We also
   search for emission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by
   volcanic activity and derive upper limits for these lines. In the whole
   spectrum we finally try to identify other lines originating in the
   planet.
   Conclusions. Except for CaO, the upper limits derived correspond to 2-6
   x 10(-6) L-{*}, demonstrating the capability of UVES to detect very weak
   lines. Our observations certainly exclude the extreme interpretations of
   data for CoRoT-7b, such as an exosphere that emits 2000 times as
   brightly as Mercury.},

Journal = MP,

Volume = {101},
Pages = {1345-1361},
Abstract = {Core-valence basis sets for the alkali and alkaline earth metals Li, Be,
   Na, Mg, K, and Ca are proposed. The basis sets are validated by
   calculating spectroscopic constants of a variety of diatomic molecules
   involving these elements. Neglect of (3s, 3p) correlation in K and Ca
   compounds will lead to erratic results at best, and chemically
   nonsensical ones if chalcogens or halogens are present. The addition of
   low-exponent p functions to the K and Ca basis sets is essential for the
   smooth convergence of molecular properties. Inclusion of inner-shell
   correlation is important for accurate spectroscopic constants and
   binding energies of all the compounds. In basis set
   extrapolation/convergence calculations, the explicit inclusion of alkali
   and alkaline earth metal subvalence correlation at all steps is
   essential for K and Ca, strongly recommended for Na, and optional for Li
   and Mg, while in Be compounds an additive treatment in a separate `core
   correlation' step is probably sufficient. Consideration of (1s)
   inner-shell correlation energy in first-row elements requires the
   inclusion of (2s, 2p) `deep core' correlation energy in K and Ca for
   consistency. The latter requires special CCVnZ `deep core correlation'
   basis sets. For compounds involving Ca bound to electronegative
   elements, additional d functions in the basis set are strongly
   recommended. For optimal basis set convergence in such cases, we suggest
   the sequence CV(D + 3d)Z, CV(T + 2d)Z, CV(Q + d)Z, and CV5Z on calcium.},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {1998},

Pages = {872-880},
Abstract = {Absorption lines of MgH and CaH N = 1 - 0 transitions were searched For
   in foreground molecular clouds towards the continuum sources associated
   with Sgr B2 (M) and W49A (N). None of these Lines was detected with our
   sensitivity level of similar to 20 mK, Millimetric absorption lines of
   MgO, MgOH, CaO and CaOH were also searched for towards Sgr B2 (M)
   without success. The fractional abundances relative to molecular
   hydrogen are less than or similar to 1.0 x 10(-11) for MgH, less than or
   similar to 7.9 x 10(-13) for MgO, less than or similar to 1.6 x 10(-10)
   for MgOH, less than or similar to 1.6 x 10(-9) for CaH, less than or
   similar to 2.0 x 10(-12) for CaO, and less than or similar to 2.5 x
   10(-10) for CaOH, respectively. The low abundances measured in
   absorption indicate that a significant fraction of interstellar
   magnesium and calcium cannot be tied up in their monohydrides, monoxides
   and monohydroxides. The law abundance of MgH also implies that
   grain-surface chemistry involving magnesium is not efficient and that
   magnesium is depleted on to grains to a factor of greater than or
   similar to 10(2.5) in well-shielded molecular clouds.},

	of alkaline-earth atoms in ionic oxides with respect to bulk metals.
	We have identified two initial state effects, both electrostatic
	in nature, which fully determine the trend. The first one is the
	increase in the core level binding energies of the dication compared
	to the neutral metal atom; the second is the decrease of the dication
	binding energies induced by the Madelung potential of the ionic crystal.
	The sum of these two cancelling contributions reproduces the observed
	trend in chemical shifts from MgO to BaO. Chemical bonding effects,
	in particular the covalent interaction between the unoccupied d-levels
	of the dications and the oxygen anions, do not contribute in a significant
	way to the trend.},
