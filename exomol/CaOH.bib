abstract = "The D ˜ 2 Σ + state of CaOH was investigated using optical–optical double resonance spectroscopy. A combined least-squares fit of the D ˜ 2 Σ + – A ˜ 2 Π double resonance transition data along with A ˜ 2 Π – X ˜ 2 Σ + optical transition data and the millimeter-wave pure rotational data of the X ˜ 2 Σ + state was performed using an effective Hamiltonian. The spin–rotation constant was determined for the D ˜ 2 Σ + state for the first time. An analysis of these constants showed that the Ca–O bond length and spin–rotation parameter of the D ˜ 2 Σ + state have the smallest values of all the observed 2Σ+ states of CaOH. This evidence suggests the assignment of the D ˜ 2 Σ + state as arising from a Ca+ atomic orbital of mainly 5sσ character. This atomic orbital assignment was shown to be consistent with both previous work on CaF and recent theoretical calculations on CaOH. "

Abstract = {{Effective valence shell Hamiltonian H-v calculations are used to map out
   three-dimensional potential energy surfaces for the 12 lowest electronic
   states of the CaOH radical. Excitation energies and spectroscopic
   constants are compared with experiment and prior computations where
   available, but many previously unavailable data are provided, including
   excited state dipole moments and oscillator strengths. Particular
   attention is paid to clarify the nature of nonlinear and quasilinear
   excited states, Renner-Teller couplings, and state mixings. The (F) over
   tilde (2)Pi and (G) over tilde (2)Pi (6(2)A' and 8(2)A') states are both
   found to possess nonlinear local minima, due to an avoided crossing.
   Attention is also focused on the characteristics of basis sets necessary
   in high-accuracy calculations for the CaOH radical. }},

Abstract = {{Ab initio configuration interaction calculations have been carried out
   on the potential energy surfaces of the ground and the doublet excited
   electronic states of CaOH. The calculated transition energies are in
   good agreement with previous theoretical values and with the available
   experimental data. The calculated Ca-O stretching potentials at
   different values of the bond angle show typical Rydberg minima at short
   internuclear distances but are complicated for large RCa-O. The
   calculated bending potentials are rather shallow for deviations of
   5degrees-10degrees from linearity and, depending on the values of the
   Ca-O and O-H bond lengths, off-linear geometries have low energies.
   There is no evidence for the existence of an electronic state with bent
   equilibrium geometry, which would correspond to the reported state
   correlating with (F) over tilde (2)Pi of CaOH. The 7 (2)A' state (which
   does correlate with (F) over tilde (2)Pi) is found to be quasi-linear
   with a barrier to linearity of only 92 cm(-1), and similarly the 4
   (2)A'' state (correlating with (C) over tilde (2)Delta) is found to be
   quasilinear with a barrier to linearity of 84 cm(-1). }},

   Transitions arising from the (000), (010), (020), and (100) modes have

   free radicals. The data were analyzed successfully using a linear (2)
   Sigma(+) model for CaOD; for MgOD, only the (000) and (010) states could
   be fit with this Hamiltonian. Moreover, the (010) data required the
   addition of a substantial p(Pi) term to account for contamination of
   excited (2) Pi electronic states. For both species, the alpha(2)
   vibration-rotation term was found to be negative, in contrast to MgOH
   and CaOH, suggesting a less anharmonic contribution to the bending
   potential in CaOD and MgOD. These measurements also indicate a shorter
   O-H bond in MgOH than the other alkaline earth hydroxide radicals, which
   likely results because this species is quasilinear. }},
