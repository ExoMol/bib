   different values of the bond angle show typical Rydberg minima at short
   internuclear distances but are complicated for large RCa-O. The

Abstract = {{Pure rotational spectra of CaOD and MgOD have been recorded in the range

   Transitions arising from the (000), (010), (020), and (100) modes have

   free radicals. The data were analyzed successfully using a linear (2)

   and CaOH, suggesting a less anharmonic contribution to the bending
