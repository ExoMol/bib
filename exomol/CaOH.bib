Abstract = {Alkaline earth monoalkoxide free radicals (MORs) have molecular
   properties conducive to direct laser cooling to sub-millikelvin
   temperatures. Using dispersed laser induced fluorescence measurements
   from a pulsed supersonic molecular beam source we determine vibrational
   branching ratios and Franck-Condon factors for the MORs CaOH and CaOCH3.
   With narrow linewidth continuous-wave dye laser excitation, we precisely
   measure fluorescence branching for both (X) over tilde-(A) over tilde
   and (X) over tilde-(B) over tilde electronic systems in each molecule.
   Weak symmetry-forbidden decays to excited bending states with non-zero
   vibrational angular momentum are observed. Normal mode theoretical
   analysis combined with ab initio structural calculations are performed
   and compared to experimental results. Our measurements and analysis pave
   the way for direct laser cooling of these (and other) complex nonlinear
   polyatomic molecules. We also describe a possible approach to laser
   cooling and trapping of molecules with fewer symmetries like chiral
   species.},

Title = {{The effective temperature scale of M dwarfs}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {556},
pages = {A15},
Abstract = {Context. Despite their large number in the Galaxy, M dwarfs remain
   elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long remained
   a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation).
   Aims. Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres,
   update the M dwarf T-eff-spectral type relation, and find the
   atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample.
   Methods. We compare two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M
   dwarf sequence with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a
   chi(2) minimization technique to determine T-eff. The first sample
   consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology
   Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55
   medium-resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory
   (SSO). The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already
   classified M dwarfs.
   Results. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope
   of the spectral energy distribution and most of its features. Only the
   CaOH band at 5570 angstrom and AlH and NaH hydrides in the blue part of
   the spectra are still missing in the models. The T-eff scale obtained
   with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m spectra is consistent with that
   obtained with the NTT spectra. We compare our T-eff scale with those of
   other authors and with published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors.
   We also present relations between effective temperature, spectral type,
   and colors of the M dwarfs.},

   functionalized with methyl phosphonic dichloride}},
Journal = {Appl. Surf. Sci.},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {261},
Pages = {182-188},
Abstract = {The nature of apatite-organic molecule interaction was the subject of
   many investigations. Grafting the organic molecule onto the inorganic
   support may precede through either formation of covalent bonds or ionic
   interaction between superficial hydroxyl on the apatite surface and
   organic functions. The hybrid materials obtained by functionalization of
   apatite surfaces with phosphonate moieties are of interest for their
   potential applications such in catalysis, chromatography and biomedical
   domain. In this scope, calcium hydroxyl and fluoroapatite (CaHAp and
   CaFAp) were prepared in the presence of the methyl phosphonic dichloride
   (MPO), by contact method in organic solvent at 25 degrees C for 2 days.
   The products are rigorously characterized by chemical analysis, infrared
   (IR), MAS-NMR spectroscopies, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic
   force microscopy (AFM) and specific surface area (SSA). The X-ray powder
   analysis showed that the crystallinity was sensibly affected by the
   presence of organic moieties. The IR spectroscopy showed new vibration
   modes appearing related to phosphonate groups essentially at 2930, 1315,
   945, 764 and 514 cm(-1). The P-31 MAS NMR spectrum for hydroxy and
   fluoroapatite exhibits a single signal at 2.8 ppm. After reaction with
   (MPO) the spectra show the presence of new signals, assigned to the
   formation of organic-inorganic bond between the superficial hydroxyl
   groups of the apatite ( CaOH) and ( POH) and methyl phosphonic
   dichloride. The SSA decreases with increasing phosphonate amount
   especially for CaHAp modified by (MPO). AFM indicated that the texture
   surface was changed by grafting. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Journal = {Appl. Spectrosc.},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {1363-1371},
Abstract = {Visible and near-infrared spectra were collected from 53 firings of
   three different propellants from a 152 nun howitzer. The observable
   muzzle flashes had 50-100 ms durations and were collected with
   approximately 0.75 nm spectral and 10 Hz temporal resolutions. Atomic
   and molecular emissions were primarily limited to contaminant species
   including K, Na, Li, CaOH, CuOH, and CuO. A relatively strong continuum
   baseline was observed from hot particulate matter and plume-scattered
   solar radiation. A radiative transfer model was used to demonstrate
   self-absorption in an optically thick plume as the likely source of
   significant broadening of the potassium 4 (2)P(3/2,1/2) - 4 (2)S(1/2)
   doublet. Indeed, the entire O(2) (X-b) absorption band is evident in the
   blue wing. This feature is used to estimate range to source to within
   4-9\% for individual firings and 0.5\% with multiple observations.
   Ratios of atomic line intensities were used to differentiate munitions
   configurations, yielding ratios of between-class variance to
   within-class variance of 8.6 to 18.2 using 1 to 4 atomic lines. Further
   reduction of the number of features by characterizing the relative
   atomic line intensities by a temperature parameter (T = 7900-8900 K)
   significantly degrades class discrimination.},

Pages = {9095-9107},
Abstract = {This paper describes the kinetic study of a number of gas-phase
   reactions involving neutral Ca-containing species, many of which are
   important for describing the chemistry of meteor-ablated calcium in the
   Earth's upper atmosphere. Ca atoms were produced thermally in the
   upstream section of a fast flow tube, and then converted to the
   molecular species CaO, CaO(2), CaO(3), CaCO(3) or Ca(OH)(2) by the
   addition of appropriate reagents. Atomic O or H was added further
   downstream, and both Ca and CaO were detected at the downstream end of
   the flow tube by laser-induced fluorescence. The following rate
   coefficients were determined: k(CaO + O -> Ca + O(2)) =
   (3.1(-1.5)(+2.0)) x 10(-10) at 300 K and (1.3(-0.6)(+3.4)) x 10(-10) at

   s(-1). The kinetics of the reactions of Ca and CaO with NO(2) and N(2)O
   were also studied, yielding k(Ca + NO(2) -> CaO + NO) = (2.6 +/- 0.3) x
   10(-10) at 300 K and (2.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(-10) at 203 K; k(CaO + NO(2) ->

   Electronic structure calculations of the relevant potential energy
   surfaces were performed to interpret the experimental results, and the
   atmospheric implications of these measurements are then discussed.},

   -A(2)Pi transition of CaOH}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {240},
Pages = {238-243},
Abstract = {The (D) over tilde (2)Sigma(+) state of CaOH was investigated using
   optical-optical double resonance spectroscopy. A combined least-squares
   fit of the (D) over tilde Sigma(+)-(A) over tilde (2)Pi double resonance
   transition data along with (A) over tilde (2)Pi-(X) over tilde
   (2)Sigma(+) optical transition data and the millimeter-wave pure
   rotational data of the (X) over tilde (2)Sigma(+) state was performed
   using an effective Hamiltonian. The spin-rotation constant was
   determined for the (D) over tilde (2)Sigma(+) state for the first time.
   An analysis of these constants showed that the Ca-O bond length and
   spin-rotation parameter of the (D) over tilde (2)Sigma(+) state have the
   smallest values of all the observed (2)Sigma(+) states of CaOH. This
   evidence suggests the assignment of the (D) over tilde (2)Sigma(+) state
   as arising from a Ca+ atomic orbital of mainly 5s sigma character. This
   atomic orbital assignment was shown to be consistent with both previous
   work on CaF and recent theoretical calculations on CaOH. (c) 2006

Pages = {9156-9168},
Abstract = {A variety of theoretical procedures, including the high-level ab initio
   methods G3, G3{[}CC](dir,full), and W2C//ACQ, have been used to predict
   the structures and heats of formation of several small
   calcium-containing molecules (CaH, CaH2, CaO, CaOH, Ca(OH)(2), CaF,
   CaF2, CaS, CaCl, and CaCl2) B3-LYP and CCSD(T) with both the
   (aug-)cc-pWCVQZ and (aug-)cc-pWCVQ+dZ basis sets are found to give
   molecular geometries that agree well with the experimental results. The
   CCSD(T)(riv)/(aug-)cc-pWCVQ+dZ results are found to be the most
   accurate, with a mean absolute deviation from experiment of just 0.008
   angstrom. Zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs) and thermochemical
   corrections are found to be relatively insensitive to the level of
   theory, except in the case of molecules with highly anharmonic
   calcium-centered bending modes (CaH2, Ca(OH)(2), CaF2, CaCl2), where
   special procedures need to be employed in order to obtain satisfactory
   results. Several potential improvements to the W2C method were
   investigated, most of which do not produce significant changes in the
   heats of formation. It was observed, however, that for CaO and CaS the
   scalar relativistic corrections are unexpectedly large and highly basis
   set dependent. In these cases, Douglas-Kroll CCSD(T)/(aug-)cc-pWCV5Z
   calculations appear to give a converged result. The G3{[}CC](dir,full)
   and best W2C-type heats of formation are both found generally to agree
   well with experimental values recommended in recent critical compendia.
   However, in some cases (CaO, Ca(OH)(2), and CaF2), they differ from one
   another by more than their predicted error margins. The available
   experimental data are not sufficiently precise to distinguish
   definitively between the two sets of results although, in general, when
   discrepancies exist the W2C heats of formation are lower in energy and
   tend to be in better agreement with experiment. In the case of CaCl, the
   W2C heat of formation (20.7 kJ mol(-1)) is similar to 20 kJ mol(-1)
   lower than the G3{[}CC](dir, full) result and most of the experimental
   data. Extensive investigation of possible refinements of the W2C method
   has failed to reveal any weaknesses that could account for this
   discrepancy. We therefore believe that the heat of formation of CaO is
   likely to lie closer to the more recent direct experimental
   determination of 27 kJ mol(-1) than to the value of similar to 40 kJ
   mol(-1) recommended in recent thermochemical reviews.},

   are observed in the metal atom reactions with H2O2. The M(OH)2
   identifications are supported by isotopic substitution and theoretical

   alkaline earth metal dihydroxide molecules decrease from 3829.8 to
   3784.6 to 3760.6 to 3724.2 cm(-1) in the family series in solid argon,
   while the base strength of the solid compounds increases. Calculations
   show that Sr(OH)2 and Ba(OH)2 are bent at the metal center, owing to d
   orbital involvement in the bonding. Although these molecules are
   predominantly ionic, the O-H stretching frequencies do not reach the
   ionic limit of gaseous OH- going down the family group because of

Pages = {1020-1026},
Abstract = {Using a spectrograph and charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, ultraviolet
   and visible light emission spectra were obtained from a coal-burning
   electric utility's cyclone furnaces operating at either fuel-rich or
   fuel-lean conditions. The aim of this effort is to identify light
   emission signals that can be related to a cyclone furnace's operating
   condition in order to adjust its air/fuel ratio to minimize pollutant
   production. Emission spectra at the burner and outlet ends of cyclone
   furnaces were obtained. Spectra from all cyclone burners show emission
   lines for the trace elements Li, Na, K, and Rb, as well as the molecular
   species OH and CaOH. The Ca emission line is detected at the burner end
   of both the fuel-rich and fuellean cyclone furnaces but is not detected
   at the outlet ends of either furnace type. Along with the disappearance
   of Ca is a concomitant increase in the CaOH signal at the outlet end of
   both types of furnaces. The OH signal strength is in general stronger
   when viewing at the burner end rather than the exhaust end of both the
   fuel-rich and fuel-lean cyclone furnaces, probably due to high,
   non-equilibrium amounts of OH present inside the furnace. Only one
   molecular species was detected that could be used as a measure of
   air/fuel ratio: MgOH. It was detected at the burner end of fuel-rich
   cyclone furnaces but not detected in fuel-lean cyclone furnaces. More
   direct markers of air/fuel ratio, such as CO and 02 emission, were not
   detected, probably due to the generally weak nature of molecular
   emission relative to ambient blackbody emission present in the cyclone
   furnaces, even at ultraviolet wavelengths.},

Pages = {4810-4819},
Abstract = {Ab initio configuration interaction calculations have been carried out
   on the potential energy surfaces of the ground and the doublet excited
   electronic states of CaOH. The calculated transition energies are in
   good agreement with previous theoretical values and with the available
   experimental data. The calculated Ca-O stretching potentials at
   different values of the bond angle show typical Rydberg minima at short
   internuclear distances but are complicated for large RCa-O. The
   calculated bending potentials are rather shallow for deviations of
   5degrees-10degrees from linearity and, depending on the values of the
   Ca-O and O-H bond lengths, off-linear geometries have low energies.
   There is no evidence for the existence of an electronic state with bent
   equilibrium geometry, which would correspond to the reported state
   correlating with (F) over tilde (2)Pi of CaOH. The 7 (2)A' state (which
   does correlate with (F) over tilde (2)Pi) is found to be quasi-linear
   with a barrier to linearity of only 92 cm(-1), and similarly the 4
   (2)A'' state (correlating with (C) over tilde (2)Delta) is found to be
   quasilinear with a barrier to linearity of 84 cm(-1). (C) 2002 American

   5890/5896 are extremely strong, with the latter having an equivalent
   width of 240 Angstrom in the L4 dwarf. By spectral type L5, the D lines
   extend over similar to 1000 Angstrom and absorb a substantial fraction
   of the flux emitted in the V band, with a corresponding effect on the
   (V-I) broadband color. The K I resonance doublet at 7665/7699 Angstrom
   increases in equivalent width from spectral type M3 to M7, but decreases
   in strength from M7 to L0 before broadening substantially at later
   types. These variations are likely driven by dust formation in these

Abstract = {Absorption lines of MgH and CaH N = 1 - 0 transitions were searched For

   absorption indicate that a significant fraction of interstellar
   magnesium and calcium cannot be tied up in their monohydrides, monoxides

   grain-surface chemistry involving magnesium is not efficient and that

Abstract = {A design is presented for a millimeter/submillimeter direct absorption

   phase-locked Gunn oscillators as the tunable, coherent source of
   radiation from 65-140 GHz. Higher source frequencies are obtained with
   Schottky diode multipliers. The gas cell and optics path are designed
   utilizing Gaussian beam optics to achieve maximum interaction between
   molecules and the mm-wave radiation in the reaction region. Scalar
   feedhorns and a series of PTFE lenses are used to propagate the source
   signal. The gas cell is a cylindrical tube 0.5 m in length with a
   detachable Broida-type oven. The detector for the spectrometer is a
   helium-cooled InSb hot electron bolometer. Phase-sensitive detection is
   achieved by FM modulation of the Gunn oscillators and use of a lock-in
   amplifier. Spectra are recorded by electrical tuning of the Gunn
   oscillator, which is done under computer control. The millimeter and

Abstract = {The A 2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (020)-(000) band of CaOH has been observed using cw
   dye laser excitation, and rotationally analyzed. The measured line
   positions, in combination with data obtained in our laboratory for the A
   2PI-X 2SIGMA+ (100)-(000) band, have been employed in a global
   deperturbation of the A (100) 2PI and A(020)kappa 2PI and mu 2PI
   vibronic states that simultaneously takes account of Fermi resonance,
   the Renner-Teller effect, and spin-orbit coupling. All the measured line
   positions are reproduced to within the measurement accuracy of 0.005
   cm-1. The Renner-Teller and Fermi resonance parameters in the CaOH A 2PI
   state have been determined: epsilonomega2 = -36.569 19(97) cm-1 and W1 =
   10.300 58(54) cm-1.},

Pages = {1463-1476},
Abstract = {Excited vibrational levels in the X2-SIGMA+ state of CaOH and CaOD have
   been observed via dispersion of laser induced fluorescence from
   selectively populated rotational levels of the A2-pi (100) state. The
   rotational structure of the (100), (200),(300) and (020) levels has been
   analysed for both molecules; for CaOH, the (400) level was also
   observed. The X2-SIGMA+ (020) level is split into 2-DELTA (l = 2) and
   2-SIGMA+ (l = 0) components with spacings of 24.369 and 17.183 cm-1 for
   CaOH and CaOD, respectively. Vibrational term values and rotational
   constants were determined for all the observed levels, and are based on
   an accuracy of better than 0.05cm-1 for the measured line positions of
   the resolved fluorescence.},

Abstract = {The pure rotational spectrum of the calcium hydroxide radical (CaOH) in
   its X 2-SIGMA+ (upsilon = 0) ground state has been observed in the
   laboratory using millimeter/submillimeter direct absorption
   spectroscopy.  CaOH was generated by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide
   with calcium vapor, produced in a Broida-type oven.  Eleven rotational
   transitions of the species were measured in the range 80-320 GHz to an
   accuracy of +/- 50 kHz.  The spin-rotation splitting was readily
   observed in these data.  The magnetic hyperfine structure due to the
   proton spin, however, was sufficiently small that it could not be
   resolved.  The rotational and spin-rotation constants of CaOH were
   determined from a nonlinear least-squares fit to the data, using a
   2-SIGMA Hamiltonian.  These laboratory measurements will now allow for
   an in-depth radio astronomical search for CaOH in interstellar clouds
   and circumstellar envelopes of late-type stars.},
