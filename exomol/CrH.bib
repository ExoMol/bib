Title = {{Evidence for chromium hydride in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter WASP-31b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{646}},
Abstract = {{Context. The characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres has shown a wide
   diversity of compositions. Hot Jupiters have the appropriate
   temperatures to host metallic compounds, which should be detectable
   through transmission spectroscopy.Aims. We aim to detect exotic species
   in the transmission spectra of hot Jupiters, specifically WASP-31b, by
   testing a variety of chemical species to explain the spectrum.Methods.
   We conduct a re-analysis of publicly available transmission data of
   WASP-31b using the Bayesian retrieval framework TAUREX II. We retrieve
   various combinations of the opacities of 25 atomic and molecular species
   to determine the minimum set that is needed to fit the observed
   spectrum.Results. We report evidence for the spectroscopic signatures of
   chromium hydride (CrH), H2O, and K in WASP-31b. Compared to a flat model
   without any signatures, a CrH-only model is preferred with a statistical
   significance of similar to 3.9 sigma. A model consisting of both CrH and
   H2O is found with similar to 2.6 and similar to 3 sigma confidence over
   a CrH-only model and an H2O-only model, respectively. Furthermore, weak
   evidence for the addition of K is found at similar to 2.2 sigma over the
   H2O+CrH model, although the fidelity of the data point associated with
   this signature was questioned in earlier studies. Finally, the inclusion
   of collision-induced absorption and a Rayleigh scattering slope
   (indicating the presence of aerosols) is found with similar to 3.5 sigma
   confidence over the flat model. This analysis presents the first
   evidence for signatures of CrH in a hot Jupiter atmosphere. At a
   retrieved temperature of >1481(-355)(+264) K, the atmosphere of WASP-31b
   is hot enough to host gaseous Cr-bearing species, and the retrieved
   abundances agree well with predictions from thermal equilibrium
   chemistry. Furthermore, the retrieved abundance of CrH agrees with the
   abundance in an L-type brown dwarf atmosphere. However, additional
   retrievals using VLT FORS2 data lead to a non-detection of CrH. Future
   observations with James Webb Space Telescope have the potential to
   confirm the detection and/or discover other CrH features.}},

Title = {{Paschen-Back effect in the CrH molecule and its application for magnetic
   field measurements on stars, brown dwarfs, and hot exoplanets}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{558}},
Abstract = {{Aims. We investigated the Paschen-Back effect in the (0,0) band of the
   A(6)Sigma(+)-X-6 Sigma(+) system of the CrH molecule, and we examined
   its potential for estimating magnetic fields on stars and substellar
   objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot exoplanets.
   Methods. We carried out quantum mechanical calculations to obtain the
   energy level structure of the electronic-vibrational-rotational states
   considered both in the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field.
   Level mixing due to magnetic field perturbation (the Paschen-Back
   effect) was consistently taken into account. Then, we calculated
   frequencies and strengths of transitions between magnetic sublevels.
   Employing these results and solving numerically a set of the radiative
   transfer equations for polarized radiation, we calculated Stokes
   parameters for both the individual lines and the (0, 0) band depending
   on the strength and orientation of the magnetic field.
   Results. We demonstrate that magnetic splitting of the individual CrH
   lines shows a significant asymmetry due to the Paschen-Back effect
   already at 1 G field. This leads to a considerable signal in both
   circular and linear polarization, up to 30\% at the magnetic field
   strength of >= 3 kG in early L dwarfs. The polarization does not cancel
   out completely even at very low spectral resolution and is seen as
   broad-band polarization of a few percent. Since the line asymmetry
   depends only on the magnetic field strength and not on the filling
   factor, CrH lines provide a very sensitive tool for direct measurement
   of the stellar magnetic fields on faint cool objects, such as brown
   dwarfs and hot Jupiters, observed with low spectral resolution.}},

Title = {Systematic study of first-row transition-metal diatomic molecules: A

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Journal = JCP,

Volume = {129},
Abstract = {We investigate gas-phase neutral and cationic hydrides formed by 3d
   transition metals from Sc to Cu with density functional theory (DFT)
   methods. The performance of two exchange-correlation functionals,
   Boese-Martin for kinetics (BMK) and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
   (TPSS), in predicting bond lengths and energetics, electronic
   structures, dipole moments, and ionization potentials is evaluated in
   comparison with available experimental data. To ensure a unique
   self-consistent field (SCF) solution, we use stability analysis, Fermi
   smearing, and continuity analysis of the potential energy curves.
   Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively
   correct description of the bond dissociation. We found that on average
   BMK predicted values of dissociation energies and ionization potentials
   are closer to experiment than those obtained with high level wave
   function theory methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the
   fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased.
   Natural bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the
   details of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference
   character in the wave function description of the hydrides is reproduced
   in broken-symmetry DFT description, as evidenced by NBO analysis. We
   also propose a new scheme to correct for spin contamination arising in
   broken-symmetry DFT approach. Unlike conventional schemes, our spin
   correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
   individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
   values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure
   singlet state from the energy of the broken-symmetry DFT description of
   the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
   and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized
   electron pairs). The high spin states are build with canonical natural
   orbitals and do not require SCF convergence.},

Abstract = {The magnetic tuning of the low- rotational levels of the A (6)Sigma(+)

Title = {Measuring magnetic fields in ultracool stars and brown dwarfs},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {644},
Pages = {497-509},
Abstract = {We present a new method for direct measurement of magnetic fields on
   ultracool stars and brown dwarfs. It takes advantage of the Wing-Ford
   bands of FeH, which are seen throughout the M and L spectral types.
   These molecular features are not as blended as other optical molecular
   bands, are reasonably strong through most of the spectral range, and
   exhibit a response to magnetic fields that is easier to detect than
   other magnetic diagnostics, including the usual optical and
   near-infrared atomic spectral lines that have heretofore been employed.
   The FeH bands show a systematic growth as the star gets cooler. We do
   not find any contamination by CrH in the relevant spectral region. We
   are able to model cool and rapidly rotating spectra from warmer, slowly
   rotating spectra utilizing an interpolation scheme based on
   curve-of-growth analysis. We show that the FeH features can distinguish
   between negligible, moderate, and high magnetic fluxes on low-mass
   dwarfs, with a current accuracy of about 1 kG. Two different approaches
   to extracting the information from the spectra are developed and
   compared. Which one is superior depends on a number of factors. We
   demonstrate the validity of our new procedures by comparing the spectra
   of three M stars whose magnetic fluxes are already known from atomic
   line analysis. The low- and high-field stars are used to produce
   interpolated moderate-strength spectra that closely resemble the
   moderate-field star. The assumption of linear behavior for the magnetic
   effects appears to be reasonable, but until the molecular constants are
   better understood, the method is subject to that assumption and rather
   approximate. Nonetheless, it opens a new regime of very low mass objects
   to direct confirmation and testing of their magnetic dynamos.},

Abstract = {The dissociation curves of low-lying spin-mixed states in monohydrides
   of groups 6 and 7 were calculated by using an effective core potential
   (ECP) approach. This approach is based on the multiconfiguration
   self-consistent field (MCSCF) method, followed by first-order
   configuration interaction (FOCI) calculations, in which the method
   employs an ECP basis set proposed by Stevens and co-workers (SBKJC)
   augmented by a set of polarization functions. Spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
   effects are estimated within the one-electron approximation by using
   effective nuclear charges, since SOC splittings obtained with the full
   Breit-Pauli Hamitonian are underestimated when ECP basis sets are used.
   The ground states of group 6 hydrides have Omega = 1/2
   (X(6)Sigma(1/2)(+)), where Omega is the z component of the total angular
   momentum quantum number. Although the ground states of group 7 hydrides
   have Tau = 01, their main adiabatic components are different; the ground
   state in Muff originates from the lowest (7)Sigma(+), while in TcH and
   ReH the main component of the ground state is the lowest (5)Sigma(+).
   The present paper reports a comprehensive set of theoretical results
   including the dissociation energies, equilibrium distances, electronic
   transition energies, harmonic frequencies, anharmonicities, and
   rotational constants for several low-lying spin-mixed states in these

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2005},

Abstract = {The time-delayed resonant two-photon ionization method has been used to
   measure the radiative lifetimes of the upsilon = 0 and 1 levels of the A
   (6)Sigma(+) state of CrH, yielding values of 0.939 +/- 0.019 and 1.027
   +/- 0.066 mus, respectively (1 sigma error limits). These measured
   lifetimes are about 16\%-45\% longer than those obtained in recent ab
   initio calculations, a result that is important for modeling of the
   atmospheric concentration of CrH in the class of substellar objects
   known as brown dwarfs. Based on these results, it is suggested that the
   line strengths used to calculate the opacity function used by
   astronomers should be reduced by a factor of 0.799. In addition, line
   positions are reported for the 0-0 band of the A (6)Sigma(+)-X
   (6)Sigma(+) system of the minor isotope (CrH)-Cr-50, along with a
   least-squares fit of the lines to the standard matrix Hamiltonian.},

   (6)Sigma(+), 3 (6)Sigma(+), 1 (6)Pi, 2 (6)Pi, 3 (6)Pi, and (6)Delta.
   Calculation of dynamic correlation effects was performed using the
   multistate complete active space second-order perturbation method, based
   on state-averaged complete active space self-consistent-field reference
   wave functions obtained with seven active electrons in an active space
   of 16 molecular orbitals. A relativistic atomic natural orbital-type
   basis set from the MOLCAS library was used for Cr. Good agreement is
   found between the current calculations and experiment for the lowest two
   (6)Sigma(+) states, the only states for which spectroscopic data are
   available. Potential curves for the 3 (6)Sigma(+) and 2 (6)Pi states are
   complicated by avoided crossings with higher states of the same
   symmetry, thus resulting in double-well structures for these two states.
   The measured bandhead T-0=27 181 cm(-1), previously assigned to a
   (6)Pi<--X (6)Sigma(+) transition, is close to our value of T-0=28 434
   cm(-1) for the 2 (6)Pi state. We tentatively assign the ultraviolet band
   found experimentally at 30 386 cm-1 to the 3 (6)Pi<--X (6)Sigma(+)
   transition for which the computed value is 29 660 cm-1. The A

Abstract = {We present 6300-10100 Angstrom spectra for a sample of 13 T dwarfs

   features are identified and analyzed, including pressure-broadened K I
   and Na I doublets; narrow Cs I and Rb I lines; weak CaH, CrH, and FeH
   bands; strong H2O absorption; and a possible weak CH4 band. Halpha
   emission is detected in three of the T dwarfs, strong in the previously
   reported active T dwarf 2MASS 1237+6526 and weak in SDSS 1254-0122 and
   2MASS 1047+2124. None of the T dwarfs exhibit Li I absorption. Guided by
   the evolution of optical spectral features with near-infrared spectral
   type, we derive a parallel optical classification scheme, focusing on
   spectral types T5 to T8, anchored to select spectral standards. We find
   general agreement between optical and near-infrared types for nearly all
   the T dwarfs so far observed, including two earlier type T dwarfs,
   within our classification uncertainties (similar to1 subtype). These
   results suggest that competing gravity and temperature effects
   compensate for each other over the 0.6-2.5 mum spectral region. We
   identify one possible means of disentangling these effects by comparing
   the strength of the K I red wing to the 9250 Angstrom H2O band. One of
   our objects, 2MASS 0937+2931, exhibits a peculiar spectrum with a
   substantial red slope and relatively strong FeH absorption, both
   consequences of a metal-deficient atmosphere. On the basis of its
   near-infrared properties and substantial space motion, this object may
   be a thick disk or halo brown dwarf.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we calculate new line lists and opacities for the 12
   bands of the A(6)Sigma(+)-X(6)Sigma(+) transitions of the CrH molecule.
   Identified in objects of the new L dwarf spectroscopic class (many of
   which are brown dwarfs), as well as in sunspots, the CrH molecule plays
   an important role in the diagnosis of low-temperature atmospheres. As a
   tentative first application of these opacities, we employ our new
   theoretical CrH data in an atmospheres code to obtain a CrH/H-2 number
   ratio for the skin of the L5 dwarf 2MASSI J1507038-151648 of similar
   to(2-4) x 10(-9), in rough agreement with chemical equilibrium
   expectations. Since in previous compilations the oscillator strength was
   off by more than an order of magnitude, this agreement represents a
   modest advance. However, in order to fit the CrH abundance in the L
   dwarf spectral class, silicate clouds need to be incorporated into the
   model. Given that this subject is still in a primitive stage of
   development, one should view any spectral model in the L dwarf range as
   merely tentative. Nevertheless, a necessary first step in L dwarf
   modeling is a reliable CrH opacity algorithm, and this is what we have
   here attempted to provide.},
