abstract = {All of the experimentally known electronic states of the Cr group metal monoxides (CrO, MoO, and WO) have been presented in the paper. The optical spectra of the CrO molecule have been investigated in the gas phase through a combination of the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) excitation and single-vibronic-level (SVL) emission spectroscopy in the supersonic expansion. The rotational constants of the vibronic electronic states, including X5Π−1 (v″ = 0–3), B5Π−1 (v′ = 0–10), and B5Π1 (v′ = 1, 5), and the vibrational constants of the spin–orbit components X5Π−1,0,1 have been obtained. The molecular constants of the MoO and WO molecules have been summarized by reviewing the previous spectroscopic studies, and a comprehensive energy level diagram of the Cr group metal monoxides has been constructed. By comparing the electronic configurations, bond lengths, and vibrational frequencies of all the transition metal monoxides in the ground electronic state, the significance of the relativistic effect in the bonding of the 5d transition metal monoxides has been discussed. The related spectroscopic data of the CrO molecule are available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.j00113.00085.}
