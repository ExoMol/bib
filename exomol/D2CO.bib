  abstract = {Context. Deuterated molecules are good tracers of the evolutionary 
  stage of star-forming cores. During the star formation process, deuterated molecules 
  are expected to be enhanced in cold, dense pre-stellar cores and to deplete after 
  protostellar birth.                                         
  Aims. In this paper, we study the deuteration fraction of formaldehyde in high-mass 
  star-forming cores at different evolutionary stages to investigate whether the deuteration 
  fraction of formaldehyde can be used as an evolutionary tracer.                
  Methods. Using the APEX SEPIA Band 5 receiver, we extended our pilot study of the
  J = 3 \textrightarrow 2 rotational lines of HDCO and D2CO to eleven high-mass star-forming 
  regions that host objects at different evolutionary stages. High-resolution follow-up observations
  of eight objects in ALMA Band 6 were performed to reveal the size of the H2CO emission and to 
  give an estimate of the deuteration fractions HDCO/H2 CO and D2CO/HDCO at scales of 
  \textasciitilde 6{${''}$} (0.04\textendash 0.15 pc at the distance of our targets). 
  Results. Our observations show that singly and doubly deuterated H2CO are detected towards 
  high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs) and ultracompact H\,II regions (UC H\,II regions), and 
  the deuteration fraction of H2CO is also found to decrease by an order of magnitude from the earlier HMPO 
  phases to the latest evolutionary stage (UC H\,II), from \textasciitilde 0.13 to \textasciitilde 0.01. 
  We have not detected HDCO and D2CO emission from the youngest sources (i.e. high-mass starless cores or HMSCs). 
  Conclusions. Our extended study supports the results of the previous pilot study: the deuteration fraction 
  of formaldehyde decreases with the evolutionary stage, but higher sensitivity observations are needed to 
  provide more stringent constraints on the D/H ratio during the HMSC phase. The calculated upper limits for 
  the HMSC sources are high, so the trend between HMSC and HMPO phases cannot be constrained.},

  abstract = {Context. The enhanced degrees of deuterium fractionation observed in 
  envelopes around protostars demonstrate the importance of chemistry at low temperatures, 
  relevant in pre- and protostellar cores. Formaldehyde is an important species in the 
  formation of methanol and more complex molecules.                                         
  Aims. Here, we aim to present the first study of formaldehyde deuteration on small scales 
  around the prototypical low-mass protostar IRAS 16293\textendash 2422 using high spatial 
  and spectral resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. 
  We determine the excitation temperature, abundances and fractionation level of several 
  formaldehyde isotopologues, including its deuterated forms.                    
  Methods. Excitation temperature and column densities of formaldehyde in the gas close 
  to one of the components of the binary were constrained through modeling of optically thin 
  lines assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium. The abundance ratios were compared to 
  results from previous single dish observations, astrochemical models and local ISM values.  
  Results. Numerous isotopologues of formaldehyde are detected, among them H2C17O, and D213CO 
  for the first time in the ISM. The large range of upper energy levels covered by the 
  HDCO lines help constrain the excitation temperature to 106 {$\pm$} 13 K. Using the 
  derived column densities, formaldehyde shows a deuterium fractionation of HDCO/H2CO = 6.5 {$\pm$} 
  1\%, D2CO/HDCO = 12.8 \textendash 4.1+3.3\%, and D2CO/H2CO = 0.6(4) {$\pm$} 0.1\%. The isotopic 
  ratios derived are 16O/18O = 805 \textendash 79 +43, 18O/17 O = 3.2 \textendash 0.3+0.2, 
  and 12C/13 C = 56 \textendash 11 +8.                                       
  Conclusions. The HDCO/H2CO ratio is lower than that found in previous studies, 
  highlighting the uncertainties involved in interpreting single dish observations of the 
  inner warm regions. The D2CO/HDCO ratio is only slightly larger than the HDCO/H2CO ratio. 
  This is consistent with formaldehyde forming in the ice as soon as CO has frozen onto the grains, 
  with most of the deuteration happening toward the end of the prestellar core phase. A comparison 
  with available time-dependent chemical models indicates that the source is in the early Class 0 
  stage.},

  The region near the origin of the {$\nu$} 1 band, 2026\textendash 2087\hspace{0.6em}cm-1, 
  has been recorded by a tunable, diode laser spectrometer with Doppler-limited resolution and an 
  accuracy of about 0.001\hspace{0.6em}cm-1. The measurements were extended to the region between 
  2000 and 2300\hspace{0.6em}cm-1 using a BOMEM Fourier transform spectrometer at the University of 
  British Columbia. The limit of instrumental resolution was 0.004\hspace{0.6em}cm-1.About 600 lines 
  were assigned to the {$\nu$}1 fundamental band and more than 1000 to the {$\nu$}5 band. The band 
  origins were found at {$\nu$}1 \hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}2060.917\hspace{0.6em}cm-1 and {$\nu$}5
  \hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}2162.922\hspace{0.6em}cm-1. From the assigned transitions in the 
  {$\nu$}1 and {$\nu$}5 bands, infrared combination differences for the ground state have been 
  performed. By fitting the 1230 combination differences simultaneously with the published 
  microwave data, we have achieved a complete set of very accurate molecular parameters for the 
  ground vibrational state of D2CO.Both excited states {$\nu$}1 \hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}1 and 
  {$\nu$}5 \hspace{0.6em}=\hspace{0.6em}1 were found to be strongly perturbed by other states 
  owing to Fermi and Coriolis interactions. Thus, only rough estimations for the rotational 
  constants of these states can be given. Possible interactions will be discussed.},
