abstract = {Microwave transitions up to J = 53 in the ground vibrational state of deuterothioformaldehyde, CD2S, were studied between 8 and 40 GHz. A detailed centrifugal distortion analysis yields accurate constants for comparison with force field values. The isotopic species $^{13}$CH$_2$S, CH$_2^{34}$S, CH$_2^{33}$S, $^{13}$CD$_2$S, CD$_2^{34}$S, and CD$_2^{33}$S were studied in natural abundance. Accurate average zero-point structures were determined for both CD$_2$S and CH$_2$S: CH$_2$S CS=1.6138(4) CH = 1.0962(6) Å ∠HCH =$116^\circ$ 16(6)′, CD$_2$S CS=1.6136(4) CD = 1.0931(4) Å ∠DCD =$116° 25(5)′ Changes in the zero-point geometry for deuterium substitution were established. Quadrupole fine structure arising from the 33S nucleus has been measured in CH233S and CD233S. Analysis gives the following coupling constants (for both molecules) as χaa = −11.7 and χbb - χcc = 88.1 MHz. The dipole moment of CD2S was measured to be 1.6588(8)D and an accurate comparison with CH2S was made; the ratio of dipole moments CD2SCH2S was found to be 1.0062(4). The spectroscopic and bonding properties of CH2S will be compared with formaldehyde and other molecules.}
