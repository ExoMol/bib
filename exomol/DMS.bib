  abstract = { We review recent progress in developing potential energy and dipole
	moment surfaces for polyatomic systems with up to 10 atoms. The emphasis
	is on global linear least squares fitting of tens of thousands of
	scattered ab initio energies using a special, compact fitting basis
	of permutationally invariant polynomials in Morse-type variables
	of all the internuclear distances. The computational mathematics
	underlying this approach is reviewed first, followed by a review
	of the practical approaches used to obtain the data for the fits.
	A straightforward symmetrization approach is also given, mainly for
	pedagogical purposes. The methods are illustrated for potential energy
	surfaces for , (H2O)2 and CH3CHO. The relationship of this approach
	to other approaches is also briefly reviewed. },

	In the present work, the determination of molecular properties as
	the expectation value or energy derivative are compared for a wide
	class of electron correlation treatments that are based on the stationarity
	of certain modified energy functionals. The case in which all perturbation-dependent
	parameters the energy expression are optimized is taken as a reference
	point, to which the derivative and the expectation value approaches
	are related by a sequence of approximations. By analyzing the validity
	of these approximations, we are in a position to give general criteria
	for the choice of the method to be employed. The derivative approach
	is shown to be a special case of a general method to improve the
	calculation of molecular properties. Furthermore, this method is
	extended to give a correction to the energy itself.},

	effects on molecular electric dipole moments?},
  journal = MP,
  year = {2009},
  volume = {107},
  pages = {1153-1159},
  abstract = {We estimated the post-Born-Oppenheimer (post-BO) contribution to electric
	dipole moments by finite-field derivatives of the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer
	correction computed with correlated electronic wave functions. The
	new method is used to examine the effect of isotopic substitution
	on the dipole moments of the HD, LiH, LiD, and H(2)(16)O molecules.
	The non-zero dipole moment of HD is solely due to the post-BO effect
	and is predicted within a few percent of the best experimental and
	theoretical results. The post-BO contribution to the dipole moment
	in LiH and LiD is comparable in magnitude to that in HD, but the
	difference in total adiabatic dipole moments of LiH and LiD is dominated
	by the vibrationally averaged BO contribution, and the post-BO contribution
	is relatively unimportant. However, the post-BO contribution to the
	dipole moment in H(2)O is much larger than the vibrationally averaged
	BO contribution determined by Lodi et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 128,
	044304 (2008)] and is twice as large as the discrepancy between their
	best theoretical BO estimate and the most recent experimental result.
	Our findings suggest that for species that are well behaved in the
	BO sense, the post-BO contribution to molecular electric dipole moments
	can be described within the adiabatic approximation to a few percent
	accuracy.},

  volume = {132},
  abstract = {We have calculated XH-stretching (where X=O, C, F, Cl) fundamental
	and overtone transitions for three diatomics and a few small molecules
	using a local mode model. The potential energy curves and dipole
	moment functions are calculated using the recently developed explicitly
	correlated coupled cluster with single doubles and perturbative triples
	theory {[}CCSD(T)-F12] with the associated VXZ-F12 (where X=D, T,
	Q) basis sets. We find that the basis set convergence of calculated
	frequencies and oscillator strengths obtained with the explicitly
	correlated method is much more rapid than with conventional CCSD(T)
	and the Dunning type correlation consistent basis sets. Furthermore,
	CCSD(T)-F12 frequencies and oscillator strengths obtained with the
	VTZ-F12 and VQZ-F12 basis sets are found to be in excellent agreement
	with the CCSD(T) complete basis set limit. We find that comparison
	of CCSD(T)-F12 frequencies with experiment is less good. The inclusion
	of explicit correlation exposes the inherent error of the CCSD(T)
	method to overestimate vibrational frequencies, which is normally
	compensated by basis set incompleteness error. As a consequence,
	we suggest that conventional CCSD(T) in combination with the aug-cc-pVTZ
	or aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets is likely to yield calculated XH-stretching
	frequencies in closest agreement with experiment.},

  pages = {313-318},
  abstract = {The general relation between one-electron electric properties e (dipole
	moment, polarizability, hyperpolarizability, etc.) of molecules calculated
	as energy derivatives (E) and as dipole expansion (D) is derived:
	epsilon(E) = epsilon(D) + epsilon(NHF), where epsilon(NHF) represents
	the non-Hellmann-Feynman correction, which vanishes for wave functions
	satisfying the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. It is shown that in cases
	when the wave function does not satisfy the Hellmann-Feynman theorem
	(e.g., limited CI) not only the NHF correction may be very large,
	but what is more important, the elements of static polarizability
	tensors (alpha, beta, gamma, etc.) obtained via the dipole expansion
	are non-physical because they do not satisfy the Kleinman symmetry,
	and for example alpha(ij)(D) not equal alpha(ji)(D), beta(ijj)(D)
	not equal beta(jji)(D) or gamma(ijji)(D) not equal gamma(jjii)(D)
	(for i not equal j, i = x, y, z). Finally, it is concluded that in
	the case of wave functions which do not satisfy the Hellmann-Feynman
	theorem only energy derivative methods are the correct way for calculations
	of one-electron electric properties of molecules. (C) 2002 Elsevier

	amplitudes. The correlated density matrix equivalent through the

	sum of the overtone intensities. The direction of this effective
	DMF was found to be tilted away from the OH bond by about 30\&DEG;
	for the polyatomic molecules. The nonlinearity of the DMFs in the
	directions parallel and perpendicular to the OH bond is discussed

	1-D DMFs with the vibrational wave function expansion method and
	derived the effective portion of the 1-D DMF that is responsible
