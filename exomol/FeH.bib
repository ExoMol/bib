abstract = {MARVEL software was used to perform a global fit on all FeH transitions available in the literature to create an optimized and comprehensive term energy list. The diverse types of data, data sources, and electronic transitions that were used for this fit are organized and tabulated. To improve the fit, inconsistencies in the F 4Δ -X 4Δ analysis published in 1987 were fixed using modern computation and visualization techniques. F 4Δ -A 4Π transitions were identified in spectra published in the Kitt Peak archive and added to the fit. Also, several laser excitation and Fourier transform spectrometer measurements taken in our lab were added, including those from the newly discovered I 4Φ electronic state. The final term energy list and transition list are given in the supplementary material.}

Title = {Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of red giant stars:
   semi-global models for interpreting interferometric observations},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {524},
Abstract = {Context. Theoretical predictions from models of red giant branch stars
   are a valuable tool for various applications in astrophysics ranging
   from galactic chemical evolution to studies of exoplanetary systems.
   Aims. We use the radiative transfer code OPTIM3D and realistic 3D
   radiative-hydrodynamical (RHD) surface convection simulations of red
   giants to explore the impact of granulation on interferometric
   observables. We assess how 3D simulations of surface convection can be
   validated against observations.
   Methods. We computed intensity maps for the 3D simulation snapshots in
   two filters, the optical at 5000 +/- 300 angstrom and the K band 2.14
   +/- 0.26 mu m FLUOR filter, corresponding to the wavelength-range of
   instruments mounted on the CHARA interferometer. From the intensity
   maps, we constructed images of the stellar disks and account for
   center-to-limb variations. We then derived interferometric visibility
   amplitudes and phases. We study their behavior with position angle and
   wavelength, and compare them with CHARA observations of the red giant
   star HD 214868.
   Results. We provide average limb darkening coefficients for different
   metallicities and wavelengths ranges. We explain prospects for detecting
   and characterizing granulation and center-to-limb variations of red
   giant stars with today's interferometers. Regarding interferometric
   observables, we find that the effect of convective-related surface
   structures depends on metallicity and surface gravity. We provide
   theoretical closure-phases that should be incorporated into the analysis
   of red giant planet companion closure phase signals. We estimate 3D-1D
   corrections to stellar radii determination: 3D models are similar to
   3.5\% smaller to similar to 1\% larger in the optical than 1D, and
   roughly 0.5 to 1.5\% smaller in the infrared. Even if these corrections
   are small, they are needed to properly set the zero point of effective
   temperature scale derived by interferometry and to strengthen the
   confidence of existing red giant catalogs of calibrating stars for
   interferometry. Finally, we show that our RHD simulations provide an
   excellent fit to the red giant HD 214868 even though more observations
   are needed at higher spatial frequencies and shorter wavelength.},

Title = {Spectroscopic characterization of 78 DENIS ultracool dwarf candidates in

Journal = AA,

Volume = {517},
Abstract = {Aims. We search for new ultracool dwarfs and report here our
   observations of 78 ultracool dwarf candidates that have been
   photometrically selected using the DENIS survey point source catalogue.
   We analyze low-resolution optical spectroscopic observations to estimate
   spectral types of all candidates.
   Methods. We derive spectral types for each object using measurements of
   the PC3 spectral index as defined in Martin et al. They range from M6 to
   L3. The Ha emission and NaI subordinate doublet (818.3 nm and 819.9 nm)
   equivalent widths are measured in the spectra to identify young stellar
   objects. Spectroscopic indices of TiO, VO, CrH, and FeH molecular
   features are also reported.
   Results. A rule-of-thumb criterion for selecting young very low-mass
   objects using the NaI doublet equivalent width is given. It is used to
   confirm seven new members of the Upper Sco OB association and two new
   members of the R Cr-A star-forming region. Four of our field objects are
   also classified as very young, but are not members of any known nearby
   young association. The frequency of lower-gravity young objects in our
   field ultracool sample is 8.5\%. Our results provide the first
   spectroscopic classification for 42 ultracool dwarfs in the solar
   vicinity with spectrophotometric distances in the range 17 pc to 65 pc
   (3 of them being new L dwarfs within 20 pc).},

Title = {Modelling the molecular Zeeman-effect in M-dwarfs: methods and first
   results},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {523},
Abstract = {Aims. We present first quantitative results of the surface magnetic
   field measurements in selected M-dwarfs based on detailed spectra
   synthesis conducted simultaneously in atomic and molecular lines of the
   FeH Wing-Ford F(4) Delta - X(4) Delta transitions.
   Methods. A modified version of the Molecular Zeeman Library (MZL) was
   used to compute Lande g-factors for FeH lines in different Hund's cases.
   Magnetic spectra synthesis was performed with the SYNMAST code.
   Results. We show that the implementation of different Hund's case for
   FeH states depending on their quantum numbers allows us to achieve a
   good fit to the majority of lines in a sunspot spectrum in an automatic
   regime. Strong magnetic fields are confirmed via the modelling of atomic
   and FeH lines for three M-dwarfs YZ CMi, EV Lac, and AD Leo, but their
   mean intensities are found to be systematically lower than previously
   reported. A much weaker field (1.7-2 kG against 2.7 kG) is required to
   fit FeH lines in the spectra of GJ 1224.
   Conclusions. Our method allows us to measure average magnetic fields in
   very low-mass stars from polarized radiative transfer. The obtained
   results indicate that the fields reported in earlier works were probably
   overestimated by about 15-30\%. Higher quality observations are needed
   for more definite results.},

Title = {CRIRES spectroscopy and empirical line-by-line identification of FeH
   molecular absorption in an M dwarf},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {523},
Abstract = {Molecular FeH provides a large number of sharp and isolated absorption
   lines that can be used to measure radial velocity, rotation, or magnetic
   field strength with high accuracy. Our aim is to provide an FeH atlas
   for M-type stars in the spectral region from 986 nm to 1077 nm
   (Wing-Ford band). To identify these lines in CRIRES spectra of the
   magnetically inactive, slowly rotating, M5.5 dwarf GJ1002, we calculated
   model spectra for the selected spectral region with theoretical FeH line
   data. In general this line list agrees with the observed data, but
   several individual lines differ significantly in position or in line
   strength. After identification of as many as possible FeH lines, we
   corrected the line data for position and line strength to provide an
   accurate atlas of FeH absorption lines for use in high precision
   spectroscopy of low mass stars. For all lines, we used a Voigt function
   to obtain their positions and equivalent widths. Identification with
   theoretical lines was done by hand. For confirmation of the identified
   lines, we used statistical methods, cross-correlation techniques, and
   line intensities. Eventually, we were able to identify FeH lines from
   the (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (4, 3)
   vibrational bands in the observed spectra and correct the positions of
   the lines if necessary. The deviations between theoretical and observed
   positions follow a normal distribution approximately around zero. In
   order to empirically correct the line strength, we determined T(eff),
   instrumental broadening (rotational broadening) and a van der Waals
   enhancement factor for the FeH lines in GJ1002. We also give the scaling
   factors for the Einstein A values to correct the line strengths. With
   the identified lines, we derived rotational temperatures from the line
   intensities for GJ1002. We conclude that FeH lines can be used for a
   wide variety of applications in astrophysics. With the identified lines
   it will be possible for example to characterize magnetically sensitive
   or very temperature sensitive lines, which can be used to investigate
   M-type stars.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more

Title = {Physical parameters of T dwarfs derived from high-resolution
   near-infrared spectra},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {501},
Pages = {1059-1071},
Abstract = {Aims. We determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and
   projected rotational velocity of nine T dwarfs from the comparison of
   high-resolution near-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate
   the mass and age of the objects from state-of-the-art models.
   Methods. We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar metallicity models
   provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of nine T-type field
   dwarfs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph
   NIRSPEC using ten echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.147
   to 1.347 mu m with a resolving power R similar to 20 000. The projected
   rotational velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity of the
   objects are determined based on the minimum root mean square of the
   differences between the modelled and observed relative fluxes. Estimates
   of the mass and age of the objects are obtained from effective
   temperature-surface gravity diagrams, where our results are compared
   with existing solar metallicity models.
   Results. The modelled spectra reproduce quite well the observed features
   for most of the T dwarfs, with effective temperatures in the range of
   922-1009 K, and surface gravities between 10(4.1) and 10(4.9) cm s(-2).
   Our results support the assumption of a dust free atmosphere for T
   dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and then gravitationally
   sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra do not accurately
   mimic some individual very strong lines like the Ki doublet at 1.2436
   and 1.2525 mu m. Our modelled spectra does not match well the observed
   spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely SDSSp
   J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is
   likely due to the presence of condensate clouds that are not
   incorporated in the models used here. By comparing our results and their
   uncertainties to evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval
   approximate to 5-75 M(J) for T dwarfs later than T5, which are in good
   agreement with those found in the literature. We found apparent young
   ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for the same T dwarfs,
   which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.},

Title = {3D simulations of M star atmosphere velocities and their influence on
   molecular FeH lines},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {508},
Pages = {1429-1442},
Abstract = {Context. The measurement of line broadening in cool stars is in general
   a difficult task. In order to detect slow rotation or weak magnetic
   fields, an accuracy of 1 kms(-1) is needed. In this regime the
   broadening from convective motion becomes important. We present an
   investigation of the velocity fields in early to late M-type star
   hydrodynamic models, and we simulate their influence on FeH molecular
   line shapes. The M star model parameters range between log g of 3.0-5.0
   and effective temperatures from 2500 K to 4000 K. Aims. Our aim is to
   characterize the T(eff)- and log g-dependence of the velocity fields and
   express them in terms of micro-and macro-turbulent velocities in the one
   dimensional sense. We present a direct comparison between 3D
   hydrodynamical velocity fields and 1D turbulent velocities. The velocity
   fields strongly affect the line shapes of FeH, and it is our goal to
   give a rough estimate of the log g and T(eff) parameter range in which
   3D spectral synthesis is necessary and where 1D synthesis suffices. We
   want to distinguish between the velocity-broadening from convective
   motion and the rotational-or Zeeman-broadening in M-type stars we are
   planning to measure. For the latter, FeH lines are an important
   indicator.
   Methods. In order to calculate M-star structure models, we employ the 3D
   radiative-hydrodynamics (RHD) code CO(5)BOLD. The spectral synthesis in
   these models is performed with the line synthesis code LINFOR3D. We
   describe the 3D velocity fields in terms of a Gaussian standard
   deviations and project them onto the line of sight to include
   geometrical and limb-darkening effects. The micro- and macro-turbulent
   velocities are determined with the ``curve of growth{''} method and
   convolution with a Gaussian velocity profile, respectively. To
   characterize the log g and T(eff) dependence of FeH lines, the
   equivalent width, line width, and line depth are examined.
   Results. The velocity fields in M-stars strongly depend on log g and
   T(eff). They become stronger with decreasing log g and increasing
   T(eff). The projected velocities from the 3D models agree within similar
   to 100 m s(-1) with the 1D micro-and macro-turbulent velocities. The FeH
   line quantities systematically depend on log g and T(eff).
   Conclusions. The influence of hydrodynamic velocity fields on line
   shapes of M-type stars can well be reproduced with 1D broadening
   methods. FeH lines turn out to provide a means to measure log g and
   T(eff) in M-type stars. Since different FeH lines all behave in a
   similar manner, they provide an ideal measure for rotational and
   magnetic broadening.},

Title = {CLOUDS search for variability in brown dwarf atmospheres - Infrared
   spectroscopic time series of L/T transition brown dwarfs},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {487},
Pages = {277-292},
Abstract = {Context. L-type ultra-cool dwarfs and brown dwarfs have cloudy
   atmospheres that could host weather-like phenomena. The detection of
   photometric or spectral variability would provide insight into
   unresolved atmospheric heterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud
   deck. Indeed, a number of ultra-cool dwarfs have been reported to vary.
   Additional time-resolved spectral observations of brown dwarfs offer the
   opportunity for further constraining and characterising atmospheric
   variability. Aims. It has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities
   in the global cloud deck may account for the L-to T-type transition when
   brown dwarf photospheres evolve from cloudy to clear conditions. Such a
   mechanism is compatible with variability. We searched for variability in
   the spectra of five L6 to T6 brown dwarfs to test this hypothesis.
   Methods. We obtained spectroscopic time series using the near-infrared
   spectrographs ISAAC on VLT-ANTU, over 0.99-1.13 mu m, and SpeX on the
   Infrared Telescope Facility for two of our targets in the J, H, and K
   bands. We searched for statistically variable lines and for a
   correlation between those.
   Results. High spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects,
   but these detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. We find no
   evidence of large-amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we
   place firm upper limits of 2 to 3\% on broad-band variability, depending
   on the targets and wavelengths, on the time scale of a few hours. In
   contrast to the rest of the sample, the T2 transition brown dwarf SDSS
   J1254-0122 shows numerous variable features, but a secure variability
   diagnosis would require further observations.
   Conclusions. Assuming that any variability arises from the rotation of
   patterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we
   find that the typical physical scale of cloud-cover disruption should be
   smaller than 5-8\% of the disk area for four of our targets, using
   simplistic heterogeneous atmospheric models. The possible variations
   seen in SDSS J1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the
   cloud-breaking hypothesis.},

   the range of known magnetic dipole moments for FeH and provide many
   lines in the F-4 Delta - X-4 Delta transition at 990 nm (the Wing-Ford

Abstract = {We investigate gas-phase neutral and cationic hydrides formed by 3d
   transition metals from Sc to Cu with density functional theory (DFT)
   methods. The performance of two exchange-correlation functionals,
   Boese-Martin for kinetics (BMK) and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
   (TPSS), in predicting bond lengths and energetics, electronic
   structures, dipole moments, and ionization potentials is evaluated in
   comparison with available experimental data. To ensure a unique
   self-consistent field (SCF) solution, we use stability analysis, Fermi
   smearing, and continuity analysis of the potential energy curves.
   Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively
   correct description of the bond dissociation. We found that on average
   BMK predicted values of dissociation energies and ionization potentials
   are closer to experiment than those obtained with high level wave
   function theory methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the
   fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased.
   Natural bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the
   details of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference
   character in the wave function description of the hydrides is reproduced
   in broken-symmetry DFT description, as evidenced by NBO analysis. We
   also propose a new scheme to correct for spin contamination arising in
   broken-symmetry DFT approach. Unlike conventional schemes, our spin
   correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
   individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
   values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure
   singlet state from the energy of the broken-symmetry DFT description of
   the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
   and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized
   electron pairs). The high spin states are build with canonical natural
   orbitals and do not require SCF convergence.},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {384},
Pages = {1145-1157},
Abstract = {Models of brown dwarf atmospheres suggest they exhibit complex physical
   behaviour. Observations have shown that they are indeed dynamic,
   displaying small photometric variations over time-scales of hours. Here,
   I report results of infrared (0.95-1.64 mu m) spectrophotometric
   monitoring of four field L and T dwarfs spanning time-scales of 0.1-5.5
   h, the goal being to learn more about the physical nature of this
   variability. Spectra are analysed differentially with respect to a
   simultaneously observed reference source in order to remove
   Earth-atmospheric variations. The variability amplitude detected is
   typically 2-10 per cent, depending on the source and wavelength. I
   analyse the data for correlated variations between spectral indices.
   This approach is more robust than single band or chi(2) analyses,
   because it does not assume an amplitude for the (often uncertain) noise
   level (although the significance test still assumes a shape for the
   noise power spectrum). Three of the four targets show significant
   evidence for correlated variability. Some of this can be associated with
   specific features including Fe, FeH, VO and K I, and there is good
   evidence for intrinsic variability in H2O and possibly also CH4. Yet
   some of this variability covers a broader spectral range which would be
   consistent with dust opacity variations. The underlying common cause is
   plausibly localized temperature or composition fluctuations caused by
   convection. Looking at the high signal-to-noise ratio stacked spectra,
   we see many previously identified spectral features of L and T dwarfs,
   such as K I, Na I, FeH, H2O and CH4. In particular, we may have detected
   methane absorption at 1.3-1.4 mu m in the L5 dwarf SDSS 0539-0059.},

Title = {The narrowest M-dwarf line profiles and the rotation-activity connection
   at very slow rotation},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {467},
Pages = {259-268},
Abstract = {Context. The rotation-activity connection explains stellar activity in
   terms of rotation and convective overturn time. It is well established
   in stars of spectral types F-K as well as in M-type stars of young
   clusters, in which rotation is still very rapid even among M-dwarfs. The
   rotation-activity connection is not established in field M-dwarfs,
   because they rotate very slowly, and detecting rotation periods or
   rotational line broadening is a challenge. In field M-dwarfs, saturation
   sets in below upsilon(rot) = 5 km s(-1), hence they are expected to
   populate the non-saturated part of the rotation-activity connection.
   Aims. This work for the first time shows intrinsically resolved spectral
   lines of slowly rotating M-dwarfs and makes a first comparison to
   estimates of convective velocities. By measuring rotation velocities in
   a sample of mostly inactive M-dwarfs, the unsaturated part of the
   rotation-activity connection is followed into the regime of very low
   activity.
   Methods. Spectra of ten M-dwarfs are taken at a resolving power of R =
   200 000 at the CES in the near infrared region where molecular FeH has
   strong absorption bands. The intrinsically very narrow lines are
   compared to model calculations of convective flows, and rotational
   broadening is measured.
   Results. In one star, an upper limit of upsilon sin i = 1 km s(-1) was
   found, significant rotation was detected in the other nine objects. All
   inactive stars show rotation below or equal to 2 km s(-1). In the two
   active stars AD Leo and YZ CMi, rotation velocities are found to be
   40-50\% below the results from earlier studies.
   Conclusions. The rotation activity connection holds in field early-M
   stars, too. Activity and rotation velocities of the sample stars are
   well in agreement with the relation found in earlier and younger stars.
   The intrinsic absorption profiles of molecular FeH lines are consistent
   with calculations from atomic Fe lines. Investigation of FeH line
   profiles is a very promising tool to measure convection patterns at the
   surfaces of M-stars.},

   spectra of M, L, and T dwarfs},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {658},
Pages = {1217-1235},
Abstract = {We present a sequence of high-resolution (R similar to 20,000, or 15 km
   s(-1)) infrared spectra of stars and brown dwarfs spanning spectral
   types M2.5 to T6. Observations of 16 objects were obtained using eight
   echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.165-1.323 mu m with
   NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope. By comparing opacity plots and line
   lists, over 200 weak features in the J band are identified with either
   FeH or H2O transitions. Absorption by FeH attains maximum strength in
   the mid-L dwarfs, while H2O absorption becomes systematically stronger
   toward later spectral types. Narrow resolved features broaden markedly
   after the M to L transition. Our high-resolution spectra also reveal
   that the disappearance of neutral Al lines at the boundary between M and
   L dwarfs is remarkably abrupt, presumably because of the formation of
   grains. Neutral Fe lines can be traced to mid-L dwarfs before Fe is
   removed by condensation. The neutral potassium (K I) doublets that
   dominate the J band have pressure-broadened wings that continue to
   broaden from similar to 50 km s(-1) (FWHM) at mid M to similar to 500 km
   s(-1) at mid T. In contrast, however, the measured pseudo-equivalent
   widths of these same lines reach a maximum in the mid-L dwarfs. The
   young L2 dwarf, G196-3B, exhibits narrow potassium-lines without
   extensive pressure-broadened wings, indicative of a lower gravity
   atmosphere. Kelu-1AB, another L2, has exceptionally broad infrared
   lines, including FeH and H2O features, confirming its status as a rapid
   rotator. In contrast to other late- T objects, the peculiar T6 dwarf
   2MASS 0937+29 displays a complete absence of potassium even at high
   resolution, which may be a metallicity effect or a result of a cooler,
   higher gravity atmosphere.},

Title = {Measuring magnetic fields in ultracool stars and brown dwarfs},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {644},
Pages = {497-509},
Abstract = {We present a new method for direct measurement of magnetic fields on
   ultracool stars and brown dwarfs. It takes advantage of the Wing-Ford
   bands of FeH, which are seen throughout the M and L spectral types.
   These molecular features are not as blended as other optical molecular
   bands, are reasonably strong through most of the spectral range, and
   exhibit a response to magnetic fields that is easier to detect than
   other magnetic diagnostics, including the usual optical and
   near-infrared atomic spectral lines that have heretofore been employed.
   The FeH bands show a systematic growth as the star gets cooler. We do
   not find any contamination by CrH in the relevant spectral region. We
   are able to model cool and rapidly rotating spectra from warmer, slowly
   rotating spectra utilizing an interpolation scheme based on
   curve-of-growth analysis. We show that the FeH features can distinguish
   between negligible, moderate, and high magnetic fluxes on low-mass
   dwarfs, with a current accuracy of about 1 kG. Two different approaches
   to extracting the information from the spectra are developed and
   compared. Which one is superior depends on a number of factors. We
   demonstrate the validity of our new procedures by comparing the spectra
   of three M stars whose magnetic fluxes are already known from atomic
   line analysis. The low- and high-field stars are used to produce
   interpolated moderate-strength spectra that closely resemble the
   moderate-field star. The assumption of linear behavior for the magnetic
   effects appears to be reasonable, but until the molecular constants are
   better understood, the method is subject to that assumption and rather
   approximate. Nonetheless, it opens a new regime of very low mass objects
   to direct confirmation and testing of their magnetic dynamos.},

Abstract = {We present new JHK photometry on the MKO-NIR system and JHK spectroscopy
   for a large sample of L and T dwarfs. Photometry has been obtained for
   71 dwarfs, and spectroscopy for 56. The sample comprises newly
   identified very red objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and
   known dwarfs from the SDSS and the Two Micron All Sky Survey ( 2MASS).
   Spectral classification has been carried out using four previously
   defined indices from Geballe et al. that measure the strengths of the
   near infrared water and methane bands. We identify nine new L8 - 9.5
   dwarfs and 14 new T dwarfs from SDSS, including the latest yet found by
   SDSS, the T7 dwarf SDSS J175805.46+463311.9. We classify 2MASS J04151954
   - 0935066 as T9, the latest and coolest dwarf found to date. We combine
   the new results with our previously published data to produce a sample
   of 59 L dwarfs and 42 T dwarfs with imaging data on a single photometric
   system and with uniform spectroscopic classification. We compare the
   near-infrared colors and absolute magnitudes of brown dwarfs near the L
   - T transition with predictions made by models of the distribution and
   evolution of photospheric condensates. There is some scatter in the
   Geballe et al. spectral indices for L dwarfs, suggesting that these
   indices are probing different levels of the atmosphere and are affected
   by the location of the condensate cloud layer. The near-infrared colors
   of the L dwarfs also show scatter within a given spectral type, which is
   likely due to variations in the altitudes, spatial distributions, and
   thicknesses of the clouds. We have identified a small group of late-L
   dwarfs that are relatively blue for their spectral type and that have
   enhanced FeH, H2O, and K I absorption, possibly due to an unusually
   small amount of condensates. The scatter seen in the H - K color for
   late-T dwarfs can be reproduced by models with a range in surface
   gravity. The variation is probably due to the effect on the K-band flux
   of pressure-induced H-2 opacity. The correlation of H - K color with
   gravity is supported by the observed strengths of the J-band K I
   doublet. Gravity is closely related to mass for field T dwarfs with ages
   greater than 10(8) yr and the gravities implied by the H - K colors
   indicate that the T dwarfs in our sample have masses in the range 15 -
   75M(Jupiter). One of the SDSS dwarfs, SDSS J111010.01+ 011613.1, is
   possibly a very low mass object, with log g similar to 4.2 - 4.5 and
   mass similar to 10 - 15M(Jupiter).},

Abstract = {We present medium-resolution z-, J-, and H-band spectra of four
   late-type dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M8 to L7.5. In an
   attempt to determine the origin of numerous weak absorption features
   throughout their near-infrared spectra, and motivated by the recent
   tentative identification of the E (4)Pi-A(4)Pi system of FeH near 1.6
   mum in umbral and cool star spectra, we have compared the dwarf spectra
   to a laboratory FeH emission spectrum. We have identified nearly 100 FeH
   absorption features in the z-, J-, and H-band spectra of the dwarfs. In
   particular, we have identified 34 features that dominate the appearance
   of the H-band spectra of the dwarfs and that appear in the laboratory
   FeH spectrum. Finally, all of the features are either weaker or absent
   in the spectrum of the L7.5 dwarf, which is consistent with the
   weakening of the known FeH bandheads in the spectra of the latest L
   dwarfs.},

   responsible for the Wing-Ford band seen in M-type stars, sunspots, and

   high-level ab initio calculation of the electronic transition dipole
   moment. The necessary rotational line strength factors (Honl-London
   factors) are derived for both the Hund's case ( a) and (b) coupling
   limits. A new set of spectroscopic constants was derived from the
   existing FeH term values for v = 0, 1, and 2 levels of the X and F
   states. Using these constants, extrapolated term values were generated
   for v = 3 and 4 and for J-values up to 50.5. The line lists ( including
   Einstein A-values) for the 25 vibrational bands with v less than or
   equal to 4 were generated using a merged list of experimental and
   extrapolated term values. The FeH line lists were used to compute the

   eV). The ground state is much more highly correlated than the a (6)Delta

   the relative stability accurately. In addition to the above results,
   spectroscopic data of the second (4)Delta, the lowest (4)Pi, the lowest

Abstract = {A particularly rich region of the electronic spectrum of FeH from 525 to

   that several different electronic transitions are embedded in this

   system, the (0, 2) band of the g(6)Phi-X(4)Delta (intercombination)
   system, the (0, 1) band of the g(6)Phi-a(6)Delta (blue) system, and the
   (0, 0) band of the g(6)Phi-b(6)Pi system. Seventy-five lines were
   assigned in the (0, 1) band of the g(6)Phi-a(6)Delta transition. These,
   with the assignment of an additional 14 lines in the 583 nm region to
   the (0, 1) band of the e(6)Pi-a(6)Delta transition, led to the extension
   of the known term values to higher J values for the Omega = 9/2. 7/2,

   the novel characterization of the a(6)Delta(3/2) (v = 1) and

Abstract = {High-resolution laser-excited fluorescence spectra of FeH at T similar

   b(6)Pi(3/2), to be identified. The J = (7/2)(+/-) level of the upsilon =
   0 level of the b(6)Pi(7/2) state lies 3902.93 cm(-1) above upsilon = 0,
   J = (7/2)(+/-) in X(4)Delta(7/2). Another weaker series also appears to
   involve a state with a lowest J value of 7/2: in contrast to the
   behaviour of most other known states (except notably for
   X(4)Delta(7/3)), the Lambda-type doubling in the rotational levels of
   the new state is very small, no more than 0.04 cm-l at J = 11/2. This
   level appears to be upsilon = 0 of C(4)Phi(7/2), for which T-0(7/2)(+/-)
   is determined to be 3755.28 cm(-1) Even with the narrow-line excitation
   and relatively low temperature of the present experiments, fluorescence
   spectra are very rich and much analysis remains. However, the
   indications are that the nb initio calculations on the low-lying states

   transition metal hydrides (CrH, FeH, CoH, NiH, and CuH) in their ground
   electronic states are reported to help the identification of these
   species in astrophysical sources from their far-infrared spectra.
   Accurate frequencies are determined in two ways: for CuH, by calculation
   from rotational constants determined from higher J transitions with an
   accuracy of 190 kHz; for the other species, by extrapolation to zero
   magnetic field from laser magnetic resonance spectra with an accuracy of
   0.7 MHz.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {3166-3173},
Abstract = {A new band system has been discovered in the electronic spectrum of the
   FeH radical at 448 nm. The spectrum has been recorded at Doppler
   resolution by laser excitation spectroscopy with a sample at ambient
   temperatures, produced by the ps phase reaction between H atoms and iron
   pentacarbonyl Fe(CO)5. The fluorescence excited when the laser is tuned
   to individual rotational lines has also been dispersed. These
   experiments show that the light is emitted almost wholly at longer
   wavelengths into the 492 nm system (the `'blue'' system). The 448 nm
   system has been assigned as a 6PHI-4DELTA   transition; the lower state
   is shown to be the X4DELTA state previously characterized by Phillips et
   al. Accurate term values are obtained for two spin components in the
   6PHI state, designated the g 6PHI state.  The dispersed fluorescence
   experiments show that the lower state of the 492 nm system is the a
   6DELTA  state and that it lies about 2060 cm-1 above the X4DELTA state.
   A conclusion of this study is that the 492 nm system of FeH involves the
   g  6PHI-a 6DELTA transition.},

This molecular bond is characterized by a temperature-independent quadrupole splitting
[Delta]EQ of 2.4 (1) mm/s and an isomer shift with respect to [alpha]-Fe of 0.59(5) mm/s.
The FeH is formed following dissociation of the H2 molecule due to the highly energetic electron-capture,
decay process. The molecule persists at least up to 70 K, long after evaporation of the H2 matrix.
These results are discussed in connection with previous attempts to observe the formation of FeH
by conventional rare-gas-matrix isolation.}
