Title = {RUSTY OLD STARS: A SOURCE OF THE MISSING INTERSTELLAR IRON?},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {717},
Pages = {L92-L97},
Abstract = {Iron, the universe's most abundant refractory element, is highly
   depleted in both circumstellar and interstellar environments, meaning it
   exists in solid form. The nature of this solid is unknown. In this
   Letter, we provide evidence that metallic iron grains are present around
   oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, where it is observationally
   manifest as a featureless mid-infrared excess. This identification is
   made using Spitzer Space Telescope observations of evolved globular
   cluster stars, where iron dust production appears ubiquitous and in some
   cases can be modeled as the only observed dust product. In this context,
   FeO is examined as the likely carrier for the 20 mu m feature observed
   in some of these stars. Metallic iron appears to be an important part of
   the dust condensation sequence at low metallicity, and subsequently
   plays an influential role in the interstellar medium. We explore the
   stellar metallicities and luminosities at which iron formation is
   observed, and how the presence of iron affects the outflow and its
   chemistry. The conditions under which iron can provide sufficient
   opacity to drive a wind remain unclear.},

abstract = "Extensive laser excitation spectra and rotationally resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectra have been recorded for the “orange system” of gaseous FeO in the wavelength regions 5790–6140 and 5580–5640 Å. Detailed rotational analyses have been performed for about 20 Ω′ substates lying between 16 350 and 18 550 cm−1. These are found to comprise a very severely perturbed 5Δi excited electronic state with a bond length of about 1.69 Å (which is responsible for the parallel polarization of the electronic transition from the 5Δi ground electronic state) and a large number of “extra” Ω substates with B′ values ranging from 0.38 to 0.50 cm−1, which almost certainly belong to high vibrational levels of lower-lying electronic states. Evidence about the natures of the “extra” states is confusing, however, with the 54FeO56FeO isotope shifts apparently being in conflict with the patterns of vibrationally resolved laser-induced fluorescence. Every single Ω substate that has been analyzed shows rotational perturbations of varying severity. The density and magnitude of the rotational perturbations are quite exceptional for a diatomic molecule, and result in a new type of totally chaotic diatomic spectrum. There is a remarkable similarity to the visible spectrum of NO2: in NO2 the complications arise from the high density of perturbing ground state vibrational levels; in FeO there is a correspondingly high density of perturbing electronic states at lower energy. The great complexity of the FeO spectrum arises because the states are in an awkward intermediate spin-coupling case which still resembles Hund's case (a) but shows strong tendencies toward Hund's case (c) coupling."
