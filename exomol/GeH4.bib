abstract = "The high resolution infrared spectra of GeH4 in its natural abundance were recorded with a Bruker IFS125 HR Fourier transform infrared spectrometer at an optical resolution of 0.003 cm−1 and analyzed in the region of 1400–2000 cm−1 where the first bending overtone 2ν2, 2ν4 and combinational ν2+ν4 bands are located. Ro–vibrational line positions and energies of the 70GeH4 species were analysed for the first time and line positions and energies of the 72GeH4 and 74GeH4 species were improved considerably in comparison with the preceding studies. The numbers of 2316/2406/873/3007/2257 transitions with Jmax = 21/23/18/22/19 of the 2ν2 (A1− and E−type sub–bands), 2ν4 (A1−, E− and F2−type sub–bands) and ν2+ν4 (F1− and F2−type sub–bands) bands of the 70GeH4, 72GeH4, 73GeH4, 74GeH4, and 76GeH4 molecules were used in the joint weighted fit of experimentally assigned transitions with the Hamiltonian model which takes the resonance interactions between the seven, (0200,A1), (0200,E), (0101,F1), (0101,F2), (0002,A1), (0002,E) and (0002,F2), vibrational states into account. From our preceding studies 5563 hot band transitions were also taken into account. As the result of a joint fit, a set of 129 fitted parameters was obtained which reproduce the initial 16422 experimental (including ”hot“) transitions of five isotopologues with the drms=3.26×10−4 cm−1. A line strength analysis of the 1697 experimentally recorded transitions of all species was made by the fit of their line shapes with the Hartmann-Tran profile and 13 effective dipole moment parameters were obtained from the weighted fit which reproduce the initial experimental line strengths with the drms=3.4%. Self–broadening coefficients of 993 lines and self–shift coefficients of 674 lines were determined from the multi–spectrum analysis of these lines."
