abstract = {We analyzed a thousand visible spectra of Fulcher-α band measured for divertor plasmas in Large Helical Device. With a coronal model and Bayesian inference, the population distribution of hydrogen molecule in the electronic ground state was estimated. The non-thermal population distribution was recovered with a two-temperature model, which has two sets of rotational and vibrational temperatures, as well as their mixture coefficient. The lower rotational temperature significantly changes according to the plasma parameters. Its nearly linear dependence on the electron density was found, which is consistent with previous works. The lower vibrational temperature also shows a small density dependence, as reported by a previous work. On the other hand, the higher rotational and vibrational temperatures as well as the mixture coefficient only show slight changes over the broad range of plasma parameters. These population parameters show a significant correlation; with higher electron density, all the temperatures and the fraction of the higher-temperature component increase simultaneously. This suggests that the electron impact plays an important role to determine the population distribution.}

Title = {Absorption Spectra of Electrified Hydrogen Molecules},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {932},
Abstract = {Molecular hydrogen normally has only weak, quadrupole transitions
   between its rovibrational states, but in a static electric field it
   acquires a dipole moment and a set of allowed transitions. Here we use
   published ab initio calculations of the static electrical response
   tensors of the H-2 molecule to construct the perturbed rovibrational
   eigensystem and its ground state absorptions. We restrict attention to
   two simple field configurations that are relevant to condensed hydrogen
   molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM): a uniform electric field and
   the field of a pointlike charge. The energy eigenstates are mixtures of
   vibrational and angular momentum eigenstates so there are many
   transitions that satisfy the dipole selection rules. We find that mixing
   is strongest among the states with high vibrational excitation, leading
   to hundreds of absorption lines across the optical and near-infrared.
   These spectra are very different from that of the field-free molecule,
   so if they appeared in astronomical data they would be difficult to
   assign. Furthermore, in a condensed environment the excited states
   likely have short lifetimes to internal conversion, giving the
   absorption lines a diffuse appearance. We therefore suggest electrified
   H-2 as a possible carrier of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). We
   further argue that in principle it may be possible to account for all of
   the DIBs with this one carrier. However, despite electrification, the
   transitions are not very strong and a large column of condensed H-2
   would be required, making it difficult to reconcile this possibility
   with our current understanding of the ISM.},

Abstract = {Context. The high spectral resolution R similar to 45 000 provided by
   IGRINS (Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer) at MacDonald
   Observatory and R similar to 100 000 achieved by CRIRES (CRyogenic
   high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph) at VLT (Very Large
   Telescope) challenges the present knowledge of infrared spectra.
   Aims. We aim to predict the full infrared spectrum of molecular hydrogen
   at a comparable accuracy.
   Methods. We take advantage of the recent theoretical ab initio studies
   on molecular hydrogen to compute both the electric quadrupole and
   magnetic dipole transitions taking place within the ground electronic
   molecular state of hydrogen.
   Results. We computed the full infrared spectrum of molecular hydrogen at
   an unprecedented accuracy and derive for the first time the emission
   probabilities including both electric quadrupole (Delta J = 0, +/- 2)
   and magnetic dipole transitions (Delta J = 0) as well as the total
   radiative lifetime of each rovibrational state. Inclusion of magnetic
   dipole transitions increases the emission probabilities by factors of a
   few for highly excited rotational levels, which occur in the 3-20 mu range.},

collected at the 247�984 Torr pressure range with a frequency-stabilized cavity
ring-down spectrometer linked to an optical frequency comb (OFC) referenced to a
primary time standard. Our line-shape modeling employed quantum calculations of
molecular scattering (the pressure broadening and shift and their speed dependencies
were calculated, while the complex frequency of optical velocity-changing collisions
was fitted to experimental spectra). The velocity-changing collisions are handled
with the hard-sphere collisional kernel. The experimental and theoretical pressure
broadening and shift are consistent within 5% and 27%, respectively (the discrepancy
for shift is 8% when referred not to the speed averaged value, which is close to
zero, but to the range of variability of the speed-dependent shift). We use our
high pressure measurement to determine the energy, 0, of the S(2) 2-0 transition.
The ab initio line-shape calculations allowed us to mitigate the expected collisional
systematics reaching the 410�kHz accuracy of 0. We report theoretical determination
of 0 taking into account relativistic and QED corrections up to 5. Our estimation
of the accuracy of the theoretical 0 is 1.3�MHz. We observe 3.4 discrepancy between
experimental and theoretical 0.},

Journal = JMS,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {320},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {Spectroscopy of hydrogen can be used for a search into physics beyond
   the Standard Model. Differences between the absorption spectra of the
   Lyman and Werner bands of H-2 as observed at high redshift and those
   measured in the laboratory can be interpreted in terms of possible
   variations of the proton electron mass ratio mu = m(p)/m(e) over
   cosmological history. Investigation of ten such absorbers in the
   redshift range z = 2.0-4.2 yields a constraint of vertical bar Delta
   mu/mu vertical bar < 5 x 10(-6) at 3 sigma. Observation of H-2 from the
   photospheres of white dwarf stars inside our Galaxy delivers a
   constraint of similar magnitude on a dependence of on a gravitational
   potential 104 times as strong as on the Earth's surface. While such
   astronomical studies aim at finding quintessence in an indirect manner,
   laboratory precision measurements target such additional quantum fields
   in a direct manner. Laser-based precision measurements of dissociation
   energies, vibrational splittings and rotational level energies in H2
   molecules and their deuterated isotopomers HD and D-2 produce values for
   the rovibrational binding energies fully consistent with quantum ab
   initio calculations including relativistic and quantum electrodynamical
   (QED) effects. Similarly, precision measurements of high-overtone
   vibrational transitions of HD+ ions, captured in ion traps and
   sympathetically cooled to mK temperatures, also result in transition
   frequencies fully consistent with calculations including QED
   corrections. Precision measurements of inter-Rydberg transitions in H-2
   can be extrapolated to yield accurate values for level splittings in the
   H-2(+)-ion. These comprehensive results of laboratory precision
   measurements on neutral and ionic hydrogen molecules can be interpreted
   to set bounds on the existence of possible fifth forces and of higher
   dimensions, phenomena describing physics beyond the Standard Model.},

Journal = RMP,

Abstract = {An overview is presented of the H-2 quasar absorption method to search
   for a possible variation of the proton-electron mass ratio mu =
   m(p)/m(e) on a cosmological time scale. The method is based on a
   comparison between wavelengths of absorption lines in the H-2 Lyman and
   Werner bands as observed at high redshift with wavelengths of the same
   lines measured at zero redshift in the laboratory. For such comparison
   sensitivity coefficients to a relative variation of mu are calculated
   for all individual lines and included in the fitting routine deriving a
   value for Delta mu/mu. Details of the analysis of astronomical spectra,
   obtained with large 8-10 m class optical telescopes, equipped with
   high-resolution echelle grating based spectrographs, are explained. The
   methods and results of the laboratory molecular spectroscopy of H-2, in
   particular, the laser-based metrology studies for the determination of
   rest wavelengths of the Lyman and Werner band absorption lines, are
   reviewed. Theoretical physics scenarios delivering a rationale for a
   varying mu are discussed briefly, as well as alternative spectroscopic
   approaches to probe variation of mu, other than the H-2 method. Also a
   recent approach to detect a dependence of the proton-to-electron mass
   ratio on environmental conditions, such as the presence of strong
   gravitational fields, are highlighted. Currently some 56 H-2 absorption
   systems are known and listed. Their usefulness to detect mu variation is
   discussed, in terms of column densities and brightness of background
   quasar sources, along with future observational strategies. The
   astronomical observations of ten quasar systems analyzed so far set a
   constraint on a varying proton-electron mass ratio of vertical bar Delta
   mu/mu vertical bar < 5 x 10(-6) (3 sigma), which is a null result,
   holding for redshifts in the range z = 2.0-4.2. This corresponds to
   look-back times of (10-12.4) x 10(9) years into cosmic history. Attempts
   to interpret the results from these ten H-2 absorbers in terms of a
   spatial variation of mu are currently hampered by the small sample size
   and their coincidental distribution in a relatively narrow band across the sky.},

Abstract = {Five very weak transitions-O(2), O(3), O(4), O(5) and Q(5)-of the first
   overtone band of H-2 are measured by very high sensitivity CW-Cavity
   Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) between 6900 and 7920 cm (1). The noise
   equivalent absorption of the recordings is on the order of alpha(min)
   approximate to 5 x 10(-11) cm(-1) allowing for the detection of the O(5)
   transition with an intensity of 1.1 x 10(-30) cm per molecule, the
   smallest intensity value measured so far for an H-2 absorption line. A
   Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive
   the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was
   accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging
   between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature
   data, the list of H2 absorption lines detected so far has been
   constructed. It includes a total of 39 transitions ranging from the S(0)
   pure rotational line near 354 cm(-1) up to the S(1) transition of the
   (5-0) band near 18 908 cm(-1). These experimental values are compared to
   a highly accurate theoretical line list constructed for pure H-2 at 296
   K (0-35 000 cm(-1), intensity cut off of 1 x 10(-34) cm per molecule).
   The energy levels and transition moments were computed from high level
   quantum mechanics calculations. The overall agreement between the
   theoretical and experimental values is found to be very good for the
   line positions. Some deviations for the intensities of the high overtone
   bands (V > 2) are discussed in relation with possible pressure effects
   affecting the retrieved intensity values. We conclude that the hydrogen
   molecule is probably a unique case in rovibrational spectroscopy for
   which first principles theory can provide accurate spectroscopic
   parameters at the level of the performances of the state of the art
   experimental techniques.},

Abstract = {The effect of an adiabatic approximation, named adiabatic Jacobi
   correction (AJC) and introduced in J. Chem. Phys. 126, 024102 (2007),
   was investigated on the complete set of vibrational levels of H-2(+) and
   its isotopologues, most importantly on the highest-lying vibrational
   states of HD+. In order to perform clamped nuclei calculations employing
   finite nuclear masses a constrained Hamiltonian has been derived
   utilizing interparticle coordinates. The Born-Oppenheimer (BO)
   potential, the adiabatic potential obtained after taking into account
   the traditional diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC), as well as
   the AJC-corrected potential have been determined by an accurate fitting
   to computed energy values. These potentials were included in
   one-dimensional variational computations and yielded the complete set of
   energy levels for H-2(+), D-2(+), and HD+. A detailed investigation of
   the potential and the complete set of vibrational energy levels show the
   merits and the deficiencies of the BO, DBOC, and AJC treatments. In
   particular, it is shown that the AJC corrections are systematically
   smaller and have a different distance dependence than the DBOC
   corrections. For a large part of the spectrum of H-2(+) and its
   isotopologues the adiabatic correction to the vibrational energy levels
   is smaller than the nonadiabatic correction, the adiabatic DBOC
   correction has the highest overall accuracy for the prediction of
   vibrational energy levels, it is surpassed by the AJC correction only
   for the highest energy levels of HD+, and thus the use of the AJC
   correction is clearly the best choice only for states close to the
