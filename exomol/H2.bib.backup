Abstract = {This paper describes the addition of Collision-Induced Absorption (CIA)
   into the HITRAN compilation. The data from different experimental and
   theoretical sources have been cast into a consistent format and
   formalism. The implementation of these new spectral data into the HITRAN
   database is invaluable for modeling and interpreting spectra of telluric
   and other planetary atmospheres as well as stellar atmospheres. In this
   implementation for HITRAN, CIAs of N-2, H-2, O-2, CO2, and CH4 due to
   various collisionally interacting atoms or molecules are presented. Some
   CIA spectra are given over an extended range of frequencies, including
   several H-2 overtone bands that are dipole-forbidden in the
   non-interacting molecules. Temperatures from tens to thousands of Kelvin
   are considered, as required, for example, in astrophysical analyses of
   objects, including cool white dwarfs, brown dwarfs. M dwarfs, cool main
   sequence stars, solar and extra-solar planets, and the formation of
   so-called first stars.},

Title = {The absorption spectrum of H-2: CRDS measurements of the (2-0) band,
   review of the literature data and accurate ab initio line list up to
   35000 cm(-1)},
Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {802-815},
Abstract = {Five very weak transitions-O(2), O(3), O(4), O(5) and Q(5)-of the first
   overtone band of H-2 are measured by very high sensitivity CW-Cavity
   Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) between 6900 and 7920 cm (1). The noise
   equivalent absorption of the recordings is on the order of alpha(min)
   approximate to 5 x 10(-11) cm(-1) allowing for the detection of the O(5)
   transition with an intensity of 1.1 x 10(-30) cm per molecule, the
   smallest intensity value measured so far for an H-2 absorption line. A
   Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive
   the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was
   accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging
   between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature
   data, the list of H2 absorption lines detected so far has been
   constructed. It includes a total of 39 transitions ranging from the S(0)
   pure rotational line near 354 cm(-1) up to the S(1) transition of the
   (5-0) band near 18 908 cm(-1). These experimental values are compared to
   a highly accurate theoretical line list constructed for pure H-2 at 296
   K (0-35 000 cm(-1), intensity cut off of 1 x 10(-34) cm per molecule).
   The energy levels and transition moments were computed from high level
   quantum mechanics calculations. The overall agreement between the
   theoretical and experimental values is found to be very good for the
   line positions. Some deviations for the intensities of the high overtone
   bands (V > 2) are discussed in relation with possible pressure effects
   affecting the retrieved intensity values. We conclude that the hydrogen
   molecule is probably a unique case in rovibrational spectroscopy for
   which first principles theory can provide accurate spectroscopic
   parameters at the level of the performances of the state of the art
   experimental techniques.},

Abstract = {An interaction-induced dipole surface (IDS) and a potential energy
   surface (PES) of collisionally interacting molecular hydrogen pairs
   H-2-H-2 was recently obtained using quantum chemical methods (Li, X.; et

   371201). The data account for substantial rotovibrational excitations of
   the H-2 molecules, as encountered at temperatures of thousands of kelvin
   (e.g., in the atmospheres of ``cool{''} stars). In this work we use
   these results to compute the binary collision-induced absorption (CIA)
   spectra of dense hydrogen gas in the infrared at temperatures up to
   several thousand kelvin. The principal interest of the work is in the
   spectra at such higher temperatures, but we also compare our
   computations with existing laboratory measurements of CIA spectra of
   dense hydrogen gas and find agreement.},

   function, as it has the correct properties both at coalescent points and
   at asymptotic distances. Moreover, the matrix elements of all operators

Abstract = {{A new formalism for the accurate treatment of adiabatic effects in the
   hydrogen molecule is presented, in which the electronic wave function is
   expanded in the James-Coolidge basis functions. Systematic increase in
   the size of the basis set permits estimation of the accuracy. Numerical
   results for the adiabatic correction to the Born-Oppenheimer interaction
   energy reveal a relative precision of 10(-12) at an arbitrary
   internuclear distance. Such calculations have been performed for 88
   internuclear distances in the range of 0 < R <= 12 bohrs to construct
   the adiabatic correction potential and to solve the nuclear Schrodinger
   equation. Finally, the adiabatic correction to the dissociation energies
   of all rovibrational levels in H-2, HD, HT, D-2, DT, and T-2 has been
   determined. For the ground state of H-2 the estimated precision is 3 x
   10(-7) cm(-1), which is almost three orders of magnitude higher than
   that of the best previous result. The achieved accuracy removes the
   adiabatic contribution from the overall error budget of the present day

Abstract = {{The dissociation energies from all rovibrational levels of H-2 and D-2

   including relativistic and quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in the
   nonadiabatic treatment of the nuclear motion. For D-2, the obtained

   recent high-resolution measurements of the rotational v = 0 levels of
   H-2, including states with large angular momentum J, is achieved. This
   agreement would not have been possible without accurate evaluation of
   the relativistic and QED contributions and may be viewed as the first
   observation of the QED effects, mainly the electron self-energy, in a
   molecular spectrum. For several electric quadrupole transitions, we

Title = {{Physics beyond the Standard Model from hydrogen spectroscopy}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {{Spectroscopy of hydrogen can be used for a search into physics beyond
   the Standard Model. Differences between the absorption spectra of the
   Lyman and Werner bands of H-2 as observed at high redshift and those
   measured in the laboratory can be interpreted in terms of possible
   variations of the proton electron mass ratio mu = m(p)/m(e) over
   cosmological history. Investigation of ten such absorbers in the
   redshift range z = 2.0-4.2 yields a constraint of vertical bar Delta
   mu/mu vertical bar < 5 x 10(-6) at 3 sigma. Observation of H-2 from the
   photospheres of white dwarf stars inside our Galaxy delivers a
   constraint of similar magnitude on a dependence of on a gravitational
   potential 104 times as strong as on the Earth's surface. While such
   astronomical studies aim at finding quintessence in an indirect manner,
   laboratory precision measurements target such additional quantum fields
   in a direct manner. Laser-based precision measurements of dissociation
   energies, vibrational splittings and rotational level energies in H2
   molecules and their deuterated isotopomers HD and D-2 produce values for
   the rovibrational binding energies fully consistent with quantum ab
   initio calculations including relativistic and quantum electrodynamical
   (QED) effects. Similarly, precision measurements of high-overtone
   vibrational transitions of HD+ ions, captured in ion traps and
   sympathetically cooled to mK temperatures, also result in transition
   frequencies fully consistent with calculations including QED
   corrections. Precision measurements of inter-Rydberg transitions in H-2
   can be extrapolated to yield accurate values for level splittings in the
   H-2(+)-ion. These comprehensive results of laboratory precision
   measurements on neutral and ionic hydrogen molecules can be interpreted
   to set bounds on the existence of possible fifth forces and of higher
   dimensions, phenomena describing physics beyond the Standard Model.}},

Journal = RMP,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Abstract = {{An overview is presented of the H-2 quasar absorption method to search
   for a possible variation of the proton-electron mass ratio mu =
   m(p)/m(e) on a cosmological time scale. The method is based on a
   comparison between wavelengths of absorption lines in the H-2 Lyman and
   Werner bands as observed at high redshift with wavelengths of the same
   lines measured at zero redshift in the laboratory. For such comparison
   sensitivity coefficients to a relative variation of mu are calculated
   for all individual lines and included in the fitting routine deriving a
   value for Delta mu/mu. Details of the analysis of astronomical spectra,
   obtained with large 8-10 m class optical telescopes, equipped with
   high-resolution echelle grating based spectrographs, are explained. The
   methods and results of the laboratory molecular spectroscopy of H-2, in
   particular, the laser-based metrology studies for the determination of
   rest wavelengths of the Lyman and Werner band absorption lines, are
   reviewed. Theoretical physics scenarios delivering a rationale for a
   varying mu are discussed briefly, as well as alternative spectroscopic
   approaches to probe variation of mu, other than the H-2 method. Also a
   recent approach to detect a dependence of the proton-to-electron mass
   ratio on environmental conditions, such as the presence of strong
   gravitational fields, are highlighted. Currently some 56 H-2 absorption
   systems are known and listed. Their usefulness to detect mu variation is
   discussed, in terms of column densities and brightness of background
   quasar sources, along with future observational strategies. The
   astronomical observations of ten quasar systems analyzed so far set a
   constraint on a varying proton-electron mass ratio of vertical bar Delta
   mu/mu vertical bar < 5 x 10(-6) (3 sigma), which is a null result,
   holding for redshifts in the range z = 2.0-4.2. This corresponds to
   look-back times of (10-12.4) x 10(9) years into cosmic history. Attempts
   to interpret the results from these ten H-2 absorbers in terms of a
   spatial variation of mu are currently hampered by the small sample size
   and their coincidental distribution in a relatively narrow band across
   the sky.}},
