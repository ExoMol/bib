Abstract = {{We recalculate the leading relativistic corrections for the ground

   the numerical precision, which reached about eight significant digits.
   More importantly, the updated theoretical energies became discrepant

Abstract = {{A new formalism for the accurate treatment of adiabatic effects in the

Abstract = {This paper describes the addition of Collision-Induced Absorption (CIA)

   implementation for HITRAN, CIAs of N-2, H-2, O-2, CO2, and CH4 due to
   various collisionally interacting atoms or molecules are presented. Some
   CIA spectra are given over an extended range of frequencies, including
   several H-2 overtone bands that are dipole-forbidden in the
   non-interacting molecules. Temperatures from tens to thousands of Kelvin
   are considered, as required, for example, in astrophysical analyses of
   objects, including cool white dwarfs, brown dwarfs. M dwarfs, cool main
   sequence stars, solar and extra-solar planets, and the formation of
   so-called first stars.},

   35000 cm(-1)},
Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {802-815},
Abstract = {Five very weak transitions-O(2), O(3), O(4), O(5) and Q(5)-of the first
   overtone band of H-2 are measured by very high sensitivity CW-Cavity
   Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) between 6900 and 7920 cm (1). The noise
   equivalent absorption of the recordings is on the order of alpha(min)
   approximate to 5 x 10(-11) cm(-1) allowing for the detection of the O(5)
   transition with an intensity of 1.1 x 10(-30) cm per molecule, the
   smallest intensity value measured so far for an H-2 absorption line. A
   Galatry profile was used to reproduce the measured line shape and derive
   the line strengths. The pressure shift of the O(2) and O(3) lines was
   accurately determined from a series of recordings with pressure ranging
   between 10 and 700 Torr. From an exhaustive review of the literature
   data, the list of H2 absorption lines detected so far has been
   constructed. It includes a total of 39 transitions ranging from the S(0)
   pure rotational line near 354 cm(-1) up to the S(1) transition of the
   (5-0) band near 18 908 cm(-1). These experimental values are compared to
   a highly accurate theoretical line list constructed for pure H-2 at 296
   K (0-35 000 cm(-1), intensity cut off of 1 x 10(-34) cm per molecule).
   The energy levels and transition moments were computed from high level
   quantum mechanics calculations. The overall agreement between the
   theoretical and experimental values is found to be very good for the
   line positions. Some deviations for the intensities of the high overtone
   bands (V > 2) are discussed in relation with possible pressure effects
   affecting the retrieved intensity values. We conclude that the hydrogen
   molecule is probably a unique case in rovibrational spectroscopy for
   which first principles theory can provide accurate spectroscopic
   parameters at the level of the performances of the state of the art
   experimental techniques.},

Journal = JMS,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {1-12},
Abstract = {{Spectroscopy of hydrogen can be used for a search into physics beyond
   the Standard Model. Differences between the absorption spectra of the
   Lyman and Werner bands of H-2 as observed at high redshift and those
   measured in the laboratory can be interpreted in terms of possible
   variations of the proton electron mass ratio mu = m(p)/m(e) over
   cosmological history. Investigation of ten such absorbers in the
   redshift range z = 2.0-4.2 yields a constraint of vertical bar Delta
   mu/mu vertical bar < 5 x 10(-6) at 3 sigma. Observation of H-2 from the
   photospheres of white dwarf stars inside our Galaxy delivers a
   constraint of similar magnitude on a dependence of on a gravitational
   potential 104 times as strong as on the Earth's surface. While such
   astronomical studies aim at finding quintessence in an indirect manner,
   laboratory precision measurements target such additional quantum fields
   in a direct manner. Laser-based precision measurements of dissociation
   energies, vibrational splittings and rotational level energies in H2
   molecules and their deuterated isotopomers HD and D-2 produce values for
   the rovibrational binding energies fully consistent with quantum ab
   initio calculations including relativistic and quantum electrodynamical
   (QED) effects. Similarly, precision measurements of high-overtone
   vibrational transitions of HD+ ions, captured in ion traps and
   sympathetically cooled to mK temperatures, also result in transition
   frequencies fully consistent with calculations including QED
   corrections. Precision measurements of inter-Rydberg transitions in H-2
   can be extrapolated to yield accurate values for level splittings in the
   H-2(+)-ion. These comprehensive results of laboratory precision
   measurements on neutral and ionic hydrogen molecules can be interpreted
   to set bounds on the existence of possible fifth forces and of higher
   dimensions, phenomena describing physics beyond the Standard Model.}},

Abstract = {{An overview is presented of the H-2 quasar absorption method to search

   comparison between wavelengths of absorption lines in the H-2 Lyman and
   Werner bands as observed at high redshift with wavelengths of the same
   lines measured at zero redshift in the laboratory. For such comparison
   sensitivity coefficients to a relative variation of mu are calculated
   for all individual lines and included in the fitting routine deriving a
   value for Delta mu/mu. Details of the analysis of astronomical spectra,
   obtained with large 8-10 m class optical telescopes, equipped with
   high-resolution echelle grating based spectrographs, are explained. The
   methods and results of the laboratory molecular spectroscopy of H-2, in
   particular, the laser-based metrology studies for the determination of
   rest wavelengths of the Lyman and Werner band absorption lines, are
   reviewed. Theoretical physics scenarios delivering a rationale for a
   varying mu are discussed briefly, as well as alternative spectroscopic
   approaches to probe variation of mu, other than the H-2 method. Also a
   recent approach to detect a dependence of the proton-to-electron mass
   ratio on environmental conditions, such as the presence of strong
   gravitational fields, are highlighted. Currently some 56 H-2 absorption
   systems are known and listed. Their usefulness to detect mu variation is
   discussed, in terms of column densities and brightness of background
   quasar sources, along with future observational strategies. The
   astronomical observations of ten quasar systems analyzed so far set a
   constraint on a varying proton-electron mass ratio of vertical bar Delta
   mu/mu vertical bar < 5 x 10(-6) (3 sigma), which is a null result,
   holding for redshifts in the range z = 2.0-4.2. This corresponds to
   look-back times of (10-12.4) x 10(9) years into cosmic history. Attempts
   to interpret the results from these ten H-2 absorbers in terms of a

   correction (AJC) and introduced in J. Chem. Phys. 126, 024102 (2007),
   was investigated on the complete set of vibrational levels of H-2(+) and
   its isotopologues, most importantly on the highest-lying vibrational
   states of HD+. In order to perform clamped nuclei calculations employing
   finite nuclear masses a constrained Hamiltonian has been derived
   utilizing interparticle coordinates. The Born-Oppenheimer (BO)
   potential, the adiabatic potential obtained after taking into account
   the traditional diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC), as well as
   the AJC-corrected potential have been determined by an accurate fitting
   to computed energy values. These potentials were included in
   one-dimensional variational computations and yielded the complete set of
   energy levels for H-2(+), D-2(+), and HD+. A detailed investigation of
   the potential and the complete set of vibrational energy levels show the
   merits and the deficiencies of the BO, DBOC, and AJC treatments. In
   particular, it is shown that the AJC corrections are systematically
   smaller and have a different distance dependence than the DBOC
   corrections. For a large part of the spectrum of H-2(+) and its
   isotopologues the adiabatic correction to the vibrational energy levels
   is smaller than the nonadiabatic correction, the adiabatic DBOC
   correction has the highest overall accuracy for the prediction of
   vibrational energy levels, it is surpassed by the AJC correction only
   for the highest energy levels of HD+, and thus the use of the AJC
   correction is clearly the best choice only for states close to the
   dissociation limit of nonsymmetric isotopologues.}},

Abstract = {{We compute nonadiabatic corrections for all bound and long-lived
   quasi-bound vibrational levels of H-2(+) and HD+ for selected rotational
   levels. This is done using the Bunker and Moss formalism with the
   correction factors computed from ab initio wave functions. The
   electronic wavefunctions are expanded in terms of nuclear centered
   Gaussian basis functions. The agreement with accurate calculations is
   very good: for H-2(+), the root-mean-square error in the computed
   dissociation energies is 0.0005 cm(-1), and, furthermore, most
   transition frequencies are predicted to within about 0.0001 cm(-1). For
   HD+, the results are not quite as good due to the uncertainties in the
   adiabatic correction. cm This paves the way for using these techniques
   to accurately predict the nonadiabatic effects for more complicated
   molecules.}},
