Title = {{Intracavity absorption spectroscopy of formaldehyde from 6230 to 6420
   cm(-1)}},
Journal = APB-LO,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Abstract = {{We apply intracavity absorption spectroscopy for measurements of the
   absorption spectrum of formaldehyde, CH2O, from 6230 to 6420 cm(-1), of
   which only a small fraction (6351-6362 cm(-1)) has been recorded
   elsewhere. The measurements are performed in the cavity of a broadband
   Er3+-doped fiber laser, with a sensitivity corresponding to the
   effective absorption path length of 45 m and a spectral resolution of
   0.1 cm(-1). The noise-equivalent detection limit of CH2O achieved with
   the strongest absorption line at 6252.64 cm(-1) is estimated to be 5
   ppm. High tolerance to broadband losses and the accessible time
   resolution of 50 mu s make it possible to apply this detection system
   for time-resolved monitoring of CH2O together with other molecules in
   harsh combustion environments, e.g., in combustion engines.}},

   studies using NIR absorption spectroscopy for quantifying CH2O in
   different chemical systems indicate that the absorption cross-sections

	methanol maser brightness in the disc during the Moment of Maximum
	Illumination by the Spiral Shock material (MMISS) and the Moment
	when the disc is Illuminated by the Stars Only (MISO). We used the

	disc were then used to estimate the brightness of 6.7, 9.9, 12.1

	been investigated in Lille and Cologne in the millimetre region at
	160-600 GHz and 850-903 GHz, respectively. The results of these millimetre
	wave measurements were combined with the 2(1), 3(1), 4(1), and 6(1)
	infrared energy levels, which were obtained from previous analysis
	of FTS spectra of the nu(4) (out of plane bending mode), nu(6) (CH2

	as well as for the anharmonic resonances coupling the 2(1) and 3(1)
	energy levels, and in this way the microwave and infrared data could

  abstract = {With a goal toward deriving the physical conditions in external galaxies,
	we present a survey of the formaldehyde emission in a sample of starburst
	systems. By extending a technique used to derive the spatial density
	in star formation regions in our own Galaxy, we show how the relative
	intensity of the 1(10)-1(11) and 2(11)-2(12) K-doublet transitions
	of H2CO can provide an accurate densitometer for the active star
	formation environments found in starburst galaxies. Relying on an
	assumed kinetic temperature and cospatial emission and absorption
	from both H2CO transitions, our technique is applied to a sample
	of 19 infrared-bright galaxies which exhibit various forms of starburst
	activity. In the five galaxies of our sample where both H2CO transitions
	were detected, we have derived spatial densities. We also use H2CO
	to estimate the dense gas mass in our starburst galaxy sample, finding
	similar mass estimates for the dense gas-forming stars in these objects
	as derived using other dense gas tracers. A related trend can be
	seen when one compares L-IR to our derived n(H-2) for the five galaxies
	within which we have derived spatial densities. Even though our number
	statistics are small, there appears to be a trend toward higher spatial
	density for galaxies with higher infrared luminosity. This is likely
	another representation of the L-IR-M-dense correlation.},

	Aperture synthesis maps of H 2 CO at 3 mm were made using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
	Association (BIMA) interferometer toward comet Hale-Bopp. These data
	indicate that the production rate of H 2 CO is 3.7 × 10 28 s -1
	at 1 AU in comet Hale-Bopp, using a simple Monte Carlo model, if
	a nuclear origin for the molecule is assumed. However, maps of H
	2 CO in Hale-Bopp, in comparison with CO, show an extended distribution
	( r s 15,000 km) with small-scale structure oriented roughly along
	the comet-Sun direction. This result suggests a source of H 2 CO
	other than the comet nucleus. The extended source of formaldehyde
	is probably grains composed of a mixture of silicates and organic
	material. The production rate for H 2 CO increases to Q 1.4 × 10
	29 s -1 assuming such an extended grain source. This value implies
	a Q / Q (H 2 O) 1.4%, which is similar to the production rate ratio
	of Q / Q (H 2 O) 4% derived from in situ measurements of H 2 CO in
	comet Halley. Production rates for H 2 CO toward comets C/2002 T7
	(LINEAR) and C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) are 1.4 × 10 27 and 5.6 × 10 26 s
	-1 , respectively, modeled using the extended grain source. The spectra
	of H 2 CO measured toward comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) show evidence
	for a second velocity component, most likely arising from comet fragmentation.},

	confirmed that formaldehyde and methanol are formed when H atoms
	are deposited on CO ice at 12 K. The present study employs ab initio
	quantum chemical calculations to investigate the impact of water
	ice on the sequential hydrogenation of CO. The most favorable pathway
	is CO → HCO (formyl radical) → H 2 CO → CH 3 O (methoxy radical)
	→ CH 3 OH. There is sufficient reaction energy in the final step
	to fragment CH 3 OH into methyl and hydroxyl radicals, which can
	be hydrogenated to yield methane and water, as observed in the experimental
	work. The emphasis here was on the two steps with barriers, H + CO
	and H + H 2 CO, with both addition and abstraction considered for
	the latter. Calculations with up to four explicit water molecules
	were performed, as well as further modeling to incorporate bulk effects.
	While ice was found to have a nearly negligible impact on H + CO
	→ HCO, it modestly enhances the addition reaction H + H 2 CO →
	CH 3 O and hinders the abstraction reaction H + H 2 CO → H 2 +
	HCO. The deuterium-substituted reactions D + CO → DCO and D + H
	2 CO → CDH 2 O were found to be slightly favored over the corresponding
	H reactions, particularly in the latter case. Overall, the energetics
	are not favorable: water ice is evidently not a good catalytic substrate
	for H + CO or H + H 2 CO addition reactions at very cold temperatures.}

  abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
	levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The
	method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
	of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
	iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
	vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
	as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions
	in each off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more
	than cn(f+1) multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates.
	Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation
	(DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal.
	The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by
	the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions)
	at most two. The n(f+1) scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed
	second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to
	any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety
	of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond),
	for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic
	energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged
	band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1,
	and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results
	for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify the causes of discrepancies
	in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices
	(up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within
	an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using
	explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule
	and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos
	method to all the examples presented here with a single computer
	program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality,
	and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly
	with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

	The effect of the polymerization of the sample molecule was minimized

	other, their individual intensities have been determined by a band
	simulation calculation taking account of the Coriolis interactions.
	The signs of the dipole moment derivatives (∂p/∂Q i ) have completely
	been determined by the least‐squares method, and the results were
	compared with those obtained by the molecular orbital calculation
	(CNDO/2) and by the analyses of the Coriolis interactions. The local
	intensity parameters of the CH2 group of this molecule were calculated
	and compared with the corresponding ones of ethylene.}},
