  abstract = {We report the discovery of a short-duration (less than 3 months) outburst
	of the H 2 CO 6 cm maser in IRAS 18566+0408 (G37.55+0.20). During
	the flare, the peak flux density of the maser increased by a factor
	of 4; after less than a month, it decayed to the preflare value.
	This is the first detection of a short, burstlike variability of
	an H 2 CO 6 cm maser. The maser shows an asymmetric line profile
	that is consistent with the superposition of two Gaussian components.
	We did not detect a change in the velocity or the line width of the
	Gaussian components during the flare. If the two Gaussian components
	trace two separate maser regions, then very likely an event outside
	the maser gas triggered simultaneous flares at two different locations.},

  journal = JCP,
  year = {1993},
  volume = {99},
  pages = {8519-8541},
  abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
	levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The
	method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
	of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
	iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
	vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
	as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions
	in each off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more
	than cn(f+1) multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates.
	Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation
	(DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal.
	The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by
	the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions)
	at most two. The n(f+1) scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed
	second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to
	any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety
	of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond),
	for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic
	energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged
	band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1,
	and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results
	for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify the causes of discrepancies
	in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices
	(up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within
	an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using
	explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule
	and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos
	method to all the examples presented here with a single computer
	program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality,
	and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly
	with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

  abstract = {Among unsolved questions raised by observations of comets is the origin
	of extended sources, i.e., the distribution of molecules in the coma
	which cannot be explained by a direct sublimation from the nucleus.
	Polyoxymethylene [formaldehyde polymer: (-CH 2 -O-) n , also called
	POM] is sometimes invoked as a potential parent compound, the degradation
	of which could produce the required amount of H 2 CO across the coma,
	but no quantitative study has ever been undertaken with relevant
	parameters. From new experimental data, we are now able to consider
	multiphase chemistry: POM in the solid state on cometary grains slowly
	degrades by solar photons and heat and produces H 2 CO in the gaseous
	phase. This is a new approach to cometary organic chemistry. We show,
	by considering simple assumptions about the cometary environment,
	that the hypothesis of POM on grains leads to a very good agreement
	with Giotto observations if we assume that the cometary grains are
	7\% POM by mass at a temperature of 330 K.}

	to estimate the dense gas mass in our starburst galaxy sample, finding
	similar mass estimates for the dense gas-forming stars in these objects

	Aperture synthesis maps of H 2 CO at 3 mm were made using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland
	Association (BIMA) interferometer toward comet Hale-Bopp. These data
	indicate that the production rate of H 2 CO is 3.7 × 10 28 s -1

	( r s 15,000 km) with small-scale structure oriented roughly along
	the comet-Sun direction. This result suggests a source of H 2 CO
	other than the comet nucleus. The extended source of formaldehyde
	is probably grains composed of a mixture of silicates and organic
	material. The production rate for H 2 CO increases to Q 1.4 × 10
	29 s -1 assuming such an extended grain source. This value implies
	a Q / Q (H 2 O) 1.4%, which is similar to the production rate ratio

  abstract = {This year marks the 50th anniversary of a proposal by Alex Rich that
	RNA, as a single biopolymer acting in two capacities, might have
	supported both genetics and catalysis at the origin of life. We review
	here both published and previously unreported experimental data that
	provide new perspectives on this old proposal. The new data include
	evidence that, in the presence of borate, small amounts of carbohydrates
	can fix large amounts of formaldehyde that are expected in an environment
	rich in carbon dioxide. Further, we consider other species, including
	arsenate, arsenite, phosphite, and germanate, that might replace
	phosphate as linkers in genetic biopolymers. While linkages involving
	these oxyanions are judged to be too unstable to support genetics
	on Earth, we consider the possibility that they might do so in colder
	semi-aqueous environments more exotic than those found on Earth,
	where cosolvents such as ammonia might prevent freezing at temperatures
	well below 273 K. These include the ammonia-water environments that
	are possibly present at low temperatures beneath the surface of Titan,
	Saturn's largest moon.},

  volume = {{444}},
  pages = {620-628},
  abstract = {{We argue that the periodic variability of Class II methanol masers
	can be explained by variations of the dust temperature in the accretion
	disc around protobinary star with at least one massive component.
	The dust temperature variations are caused by rotation of hot and
	dense material of the spiral shock wave in the disc central gap.
	The aim of this work is to show how different can be the Class II
	methanol maser brightness in the disc during the Moment of Maximum
	Illumination by the Spiral Shock material (MMISS) and the Moment
	when the disc is Illuminated by the Stars Only (MISO). We used the
	code CLOUDY (v13.02) to estimate physical conditions in the flat
	disc in the MISO and the MMISS. Model physical parameters of the
	disc were then used to estimate the brightness of 6.7, 9.9, 12.1
	and 107 GHz masers at different impact parameters p using large velocity
	gradient approximation. It was shown that the strong masers experience
	considerable brightness increase during the MMISS with respect to
	MISO. There can happen both flares and dips of the 107 GHz maser
	brightness under the MMISS conditions, depending on the properties
	of the system. The brightest 9.9 GHz masers in the MMISS are situated
	at the greater p than the strong 6.7, 12.1 and 107 GHz masers that
	are situated at p < 200 au. The brightness of 9.9 GHz maser in the
	MMISS suppressed at p < 200 au and increase at p > 200 au.}},

  journal = ApJ,

  volume = {569},
  pages = {541},
  abstract = {Formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and methanol (CH 3 OH) are thought to be produced
	in the interstellar medium by the successive hydrogenation of carbon
	monoxide (CO) on grain surfaces. In the gas phase, the steps in which
	H adds to CO and H 2 CO possess modest barriers and are too inefficient
	to account for the observed abundances. Recent laboratory work has
	confirmed that formaldehyde and methanol are formed when H atoms
	are deposited on CO ice at 12 K. The present study employs ab initio
	quantum chemical calculations to investigate the impact of water
	ice on the sequential hydrogenation of CO. The most favorable pathway
	is CO → HCO (formyl radical) → H 2 CO → CH 3 O (methoxy radical)
	→ CH 3 OH. There is sufficient reaction energy in the final step
	to fragment CH 3 OH into methyl and hydroxyl radicals, which can
	be hydrogenated to yield methane and water, as observed in the experimental
	work. The emphasis here was on the two steps with barriers, H + CO
	and H + H 2 CO, with both addition and abstraction considered for
	the latter. Calculations with up to four explicit water molecules
	were performed, as well as further modeling to incorporate bulk effects.
	While ice was found to have a nearly negligible impact on H + CO
	→ HCO, it modestly enhances the addition reaction H + H 2 CO →
	CH 3 O and hinders the abstraction reaction H + H 2 CO → H 2 +
	HCO. The deuterium-substituted reactions D + CO → DCO and D + H
	2 CO → CDH 2 O were found to be slightly favored over the corresponding
	H reactions, particularly in the latter case. Overall, the energetics
	are not favorable: water ice is evidently not a good catalytic substrate
	for H + CO or H + H 2 CO addition reactions at very cold temperatures.}

Title = {{The Rotationally-Resolved Absorption Spectrum of Formaldehyde from 6547
   to 7051 cm(-1)}},
Journal = {{Z. Physikalische Chemie}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {1609-1624},
Abstract = {{We report new experimental data on the rotationally resolved room
   temperature absorption spectrum of CH2O in the near infrared (NIR)
   region between 6804 and 7051 cm(-1) (1470-1418 nm). Data have been
   obtained by cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy and complement the
   spectrum in the wavelength range 6547-6804 cm(-1), obtained using
   virtually the same experimental set-up and already published in an
   earlier publication (Staak et al., J. Mol. Spectrosc. 229 (2005)
   115-121). Several vibrational combination bands occur in this region and
   give rise to a congested spectrum and over 4500 lines with
   cross-sections over 5 x 10(-23) cm(2) were observed. Recent experimental
   studies using NIR absorption spectroscopy for quantifying CH2O in
   different chemical systems indicate that the absorption cross-sections
   obtained by Staak et al. may have been overestimated. The results of
   these experiments are reviewed here and a recommendation for absolute
   absorption cross sections of CH2O in the NIR range will be given.
   Absolute absorption cross-sections stated here are corrected by the
   recommended factor.}},

Title = {{Intracavity absorption spectroscopy of formaldehyde from 6230 to 6420
   cm(-1)}},
Journal = APB-LO,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{123}},
Abstract = {{We apply intracavity absorption spectroscopy for measurements of the
   absorption spectrum of formaldehyde, CH2O, from 6230 to 6420 cm(-1), of
   which only a small fraction (6351-6362 cm(-1)) has been recorded
   elsewhere. The measurements are performed in the cavity of a broadband
   Er3+-doped fiber laser, with a sensitivity corresponding to the
   effective absorption path length of 45 m and a spectral resolution of
   0.1 cm(-1). The noise-equivalent detection limit of CH2O achieved with
   the strongest absorption line at 6252.64 cm(-1) is estimated to be 5
   ppm. High tolerance to broadband losses and the accessible time
   resolution of 50 mu s make it possible to apply this detection system
   for time-resolved monitoring of CH2O together with other molecules in
   harsh combustion environments, e.g., in combustion engines.}},
