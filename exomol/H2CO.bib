Title = {Stable carbon isotope evolution of formaldehyde on early {Mars}},
Journal = {Sci. Rep.},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Abstract = {Organic matter in the Martian sediments may provide a key to
   understanding the prebiotic chemistry and habitability of early Mars.
   The Curiosity rover has measured highly variable and 13C-depleted carbon
   isotopic values in early Martian organic matter whose origin is
   uncertain. One hypothesis suggests the deposition of simple organic
   molecules generated from 13C-depleted CO derived from CO2 photochemical
   reduction in the atmosphere. Here, we present a coupled
   photochemistry-climate evolution model incorporating carbon isotope
   fractionation processes induced by CO2 photolysis, carbon escape, and
   volcanic outgassing in an early Martian atmosphere of 0.5-2 bar,
   composed mainly of CO2, CO, and H2 to track the evolution of the carbon
   isotopic composition of C-bearing species. The calculated carbon
   isotopic ratio in formaldehyde (H2CO) can be highly depleted in 13C due
   to CO2-photolysis-induced fractionation and is variable with changes in
   atmospheric CO/CO2 ratio, surface pressure, albedo, and H2 outgassing
   rate. Conversely, CO2 becomes enriched in 13C, as estimated from the
   carbonates preserved in ALH84001 meteorite. Complex organic matter
   formed by the polymerization of such H2CO could explain the strong
   depletion in 13C observed in the Martian organic matter. Mixing with
   other sources of organic matter would account for its unique variable
   carbon isotopic values.},

Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {In the interstellar cold gas, the chemistry of formaldehyde (H2CO) can
   be essential to explain the formation of complex organic molecules. On
   this matter, the massive and energetic protostellar object G331 is still
   unexplored; hence, we carried out a comprehensive study of the
   isotopologues of H2CO, the formyl cation (HCO+), and protonated
   formaldehyde (H2COH+) through the APEX observations in a spectral window
   of similar to 159-356 GHz. We employed observational and theoretical
   methods to derive the physical properties of the molecular gas combining
   LTE and non-LTE analyses. Formaldehyde was characterized via 35 lines of
   H2CO, H213 2C(18)O. The formyl cation was detected via eight lines of
   HCO+, (HCO+)-C-13, (HCO+)-O-18, and (HCO+)-O-17. Deuterium was clearly
   detected via HDCO, whereas DCO+ remained undetected. The H2COH+ was
   detected through three clean lines. According to the radiative analysis,
   formaldehyde appears to be embedded in a bulk gas with a wide range of
   temperatures (T`similar to 20-90 K), while HCO+ and H2COH+ are primarily
   associated with colder gas (T -> 30 K). The reaction H2CO+HCO+-> H2COH+
   + CO is crucial for the balance of the three species. We used the
   Nautilus gas-grain code to predict the evolution of their molecular
   abundances relative to H-2; their values at timescales of similar to
   10(3) yr matched the observations in G331: {[}H2CO] = (0.2-2) x 10(-8),
   {[}HCO+] = (0.5-4) x 10(-9), and {[}H2COH+] = (0.2-2) x 10(-10). Based
   on the molecular evolution of H2CO, HCO+, and H2COH+, we hypothesized
   about the young lifetime of G331, which is consistent with the active
   gas-grain chemistry of massive protostellar objects.},

Spectrally-resolved absorption measurements of formaldehyde were obtained using a rapidly-tunable distributed-feedback interband cascade laser scanned at 40 kHz over 2778.1–2778.9 cm−1 behind reflected shock waves. The resulting absorption cross-sections were fit with functions reflecting the temperature and pressure dependence of the targeted features, enabling spectral reconstruction at any temperature and pressure within the range of the study. By exploiting the strong temperature and pressure sensitivity of the cross-sections, it is demonstrated that CH2O concentration, temperature, and pressure can be inferred from a measured absorbance spectrum. Cross-sections of common combustion species were also measured over the selected wavelength range to validate that the region is largely free of narrow-band interference. Further, the multi-parameter spectral fitting method is shown to correct for baseline interference and demonstrated in experiments involving transient gas properties.}

   Formaldehyde Hints at Low-temperature Gas-phase Formation}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {906},
pages = {111},
Abstract = {Formaldehyde (H2CO) is an important precursor to organics like methanol
   (CH3OH). It is important to understand the conditions that produce H2CO
   and prebiotic molecules during star and planet formation. H2CO possesses
   both gas-phase and solid-state formation pathways, involving either
   UV-produced radical precursors or CO ice and cold (less than or similar
   to 20 K) dust grains. To understand which pathway dominates, gaseous
   H2CO's ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) has been used as a probe, with a value
   of 3 indicating ``warm{''} conditions and <3 linked to cold formation in
   the solid state. We present spatially resolved Atacama Large
   Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of multiple ortho- and
   para-H2CO transitions in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk to test H2CO
   formation theories during planet formation. We find disk-averaged
   rotational temperatures and column densities of 33 2 K, (1.1 +/- 0.1) x
   10(12) cm(-2) and 25 +/- 2 K, (4.4 +/- 0.3) x 10(11) cm(-2) for ortho-
   and para-H2CO, respectively, and an OPR of 2.49 +/- 0.23. A radially
   resolved analysis shows that the observed H2CO emits mostly at
   rotational temperatures of 30-40 K, corresponding to a layer with z/R >=
   0.25. The OPR is consistent with 3 within 60 au, the extent of the
   pebble disk, and decreases beyond 60 au to 2.0 +/- 0.5. The latter
   corresponds to a spin temperature of 12 K, well below the rotational
   temperature. The combination of relatively uniform emitting conditions,
   a radial gradient in the OPR, and recent laboratory experiments and
   theory on OPR ratios after sublimation, led us to speculate that
   gas-phase formation is responsible for the observed H2CO across the TW Hya disk.},

  abstract = {H2CO is one of the most abundant organic molecules in protoplanetary disks 
  and can serve as a precursor to more complex organic chemistry. We present an Atacama Large 
  Millimeter/submillimeter Array survey of H2CO toward 15 disks covering a range of stellar 
  spectral types, stellar ages, and dust continuum morphologies. H2CO is detected toward 13 
  disks and tentatively detected toward a fourteenth. We find both centrally peaked and 
  centrally depressed emission morphologies, and half of the disks show ring-like structures 
  at or beyond expected CO snowline locations. Together these morphologies suggest that H2CO 
  in disks is commonly produced through both gas-phase and CO-ice-regulated grain-surface 
  chemistry. We extract disk-averaged and azimuthally-averaged H2CO excitation temperatures 
  and column densities for four disks with multiple H2CO line detections. The temperatures 
  are between 20-50 K, with the exception of colder temperatures in the DM Tau disk. These 
  temperatures suggest that H2CO emission in disks generally emerges from the warm molecular 
  layer, with some contributions from the colder midplane. Applying the same H2CO excitation 
  temperatures to all disks in the survey, we find that H2CO column densities span almost 
  three orders of magnitude (∼5 × 1011-5 × 1014 cm-2). The column densities appear 
  uncorrelated with disk size and stellar age, but Herbig Ae disks may have less H2CO 
  compared to T Tauri disks, possibly because of less CO freeze-out. More H2CO observations 
  toward Herbig Ae disks are needed to confirm this tentative trend, and to better constrain 
  under which disk conditions H2CO and other oxygen-bearing organics efficiently form during 
  planet formation. }

Title = {{TROPOMI-Sentinel-5 Precursor formaldehyde validation using an extensive
   network of ground-based Fourier-transform infrared stations}},
Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Teq.},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {3751-3767},
Abstract = {TROPOMI (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), on board the
   Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, has been monitoring the Earth's
   atmosphere since October 2017 with an unprecedented horizontal
   resolution (initially 7 km(2) x 3.5 km(2), upgraded to 5.5 km(2) x 3.5
   km(2) in August 2019). Monitoring air quality is one of the main
   objectives of TROPOMI; it obtains measurements of important pollutants
   such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde (HCHO). In
   this paper we assess the quality of the latest HCHO TROPOMI products
   versions 1.1.(5-7), using ground-based solar-absorption FTIR
   (Fourier-transform infrared) measurements of HCHO from 25 stations
   around the world, including high-, mid-, and low-latitude sites. Most of
   these stations are part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric
   Composition Change (NDACC), and they provide a wide range of observation
   conditions, from very clean remote sites to those with high HCHO levels
   from anthropogenic or biogenic emissions. The ground-based HCHO
   retrieval settings have been optimized and harmonized at all the
   stations, ensuring a consistent validation among the sites.
   In this validation work, we first assess the accuracy of TROPOMI HCHO
   tropospheric columns using the median of the relative differences
   between TROPOMI and FTIR ground-based data (BIAS). The pre-launch
   accuracy requirements of TROPOMI HCHO are 40 \%-80 \%. We observe that
   these requirements are well reached, with the BIAS found below 80\% at
   all the sites and below 40\% at 20 of the 25 sites. The provided TROPOMI
   systematic uncertainties are well in agreement with the observed biases
   at most of the stations except for the highest-HCHO-level site, where it
   is found to be underestimated. We find that while the BIAS has no
   latitudinal dependence, it is dependent on the HCHO concentration
   levels: an overestimation (+26 +/- 5 \%) of TROPOMI is observed for very
   low HCHO levels (< 2.5 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2)), while an underestimation
   (-30.8\% +/- 1.4 \%) is found for high HCHO levels (> 8.0 x 10(15)
   molec. cm(-2)). This demonstrates the great value of such a harmonized
   network covering a wide range of concentration levels, the sites with
   high HCHO concentrations being crucial for the determination of the
   satellite bias in the regions of emissions and the clean sites allowing
   a small TROPOMI offset to be determined. The wide range of sampled HCHO
   levels within the network allows the robust determination of the
   significant constant and proportional TROPOMI HCHO biases (TROPOMI D =
   +1.10 +/- 0.05 x 10(15) + 0.64 +/- 0.03 x FTIR; in molecules per square
   centimetre).
   Second, the precision of TROPOMI HCHO data is estimated by the median
   absolute deviation (MAD) of the relative differences between TROPOMI and
   FTIR ground-based data. The clean sites are especially useful for
   minimizing a possible additional collocation error. The precision
   requirement of 1.2 x 10(16) molec. cm(-2) for a single pixel is reached
   at most of the clean sites, where it is found that the TROPOMI precision
   can even be 2 times better (0.5-0.8 x 10(15) molec. cm(-2) for a single
   pixel). However, we find that the provided TROPOMI random uncertainties
   may be underestimated by a factor of 1.6 (for clean sites) to 2.3 (for
   high HCHO levels). The correlation is very good between TROPOMI and FTIR
   data (R = 0.88 for 3 h mean coincidences; R = 0.91 for monthly means
   coincidences). Using about 17 months of data (from May 2018 to September
   2019), we show that the TROPOMI seasonal variability is in very good
   agreement at all of the FTIR sites.
   The FTIR network demonstrates the very good quality of the TROPOMI HCHO
   products, which is well within the prelaunch requirements for both
   accuracy and precision. This paper makes suggestions for the refinement
   of the TROPOMI random uncertainty budget and TROPOMI quality assurance
   values for a better filtering of the remaining outliers.},

  Submillimeter Array (SMA) combined with one highly resolved measurement of a single H2CO 
  line with the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the disk around

  a rotational temperature of 24K from the flux ratio of the three ortho lines. The observed

infrared transitions of H212CO and 466 unperturbed infrared transitions of H212CO
were assigned and fitted with rms deviations of 0.0012cm−1 and 0.00084cm−1 respectively
using Watson’sA-reduced Hamiltonian in the Ir representation. Analysis of new transitions
for H212CO measured in this work yielded upper state constants with greater accuracy
than previously reported. The infrared transitions of the 2ν2 band of H213CO were
measured for the first time. The band center of the A-type 2ν2 band of H212CO was
found to be 3471.71403±0.00012cm−1 and that of H213CO was 3396.628983±0.000083cm−1.
Furthermore, the newly assigned high-resolution infrared lines of the 2ν2 bands in
the 3300–3540cm−1 region can be useful in detecting the H212CO and H213CO molecules
in this IR region.},

abstract = {We argue that the periodic variability of Class II methanol masers
	can be explained by variations of the dust temperature in the accretion

	The dust temperature variations are caused by rotation of hot and

	The aim of this work is to show how different can be the Class II
	methanol maser brightness in the disc during the Moment of Maximum
	Illumination by the Spiral Shock material (MMISS) and the Moment
	when the disc is Illuminated by the Stars Only (MISO). We used the
	code CLOUDY (v13.02) to estimate physical conditions in the flat
	disc in the MISO and the MMISS. Model physical parameters of the
	disc were then used to estimate the brightness of 6.7, 9.9, 12.1
	and 107 GHz masers at different impact parameters p using large velocity
	gradient approximation. It was shown that the strong masers experience
	considerable brightness increase during the MMISS with respect to
	MISO. There can happen both flares and dips of the 107 GHz maser
	brightness under the MMISS conditions, depending on the properties
	of the system. The brightest 9.9 GHz masers in the MMISS are situated
	at the greater p than the strong 6.7, 12.1 and 107 GHz masers that
	are situated at p < 200 au. The brightness of 9.9 GHz maser in the

distributions of species in the coma suggest icy sources of different composition
in the nucleus of 103P/Hartley 2. However, differences in the relative abundances
of species with time are minor, suggesting either internal compositional heterogeneity
in 103P/Hartley 2 is small compared with the diversity of chemistry observed within
the comet population, or more significant heterogeneity exists on scales smaller

test how compositional heterogeneity over the surface and the inner coma of a comet

Abstract = {We measured the chemical composition of Comet C/2007 W1 (Boattini) using
the long-slit echelle grating spectrograph at Keck-2 (NIRSPEC) on 2008 July 9
and 10. We sampled 11 volatile species (H2O, OH*, C2H6, CH3OH, H2CO, CH4, HCN,
C2H2, NH3, NH2, and CO), and retrieved three important cosmogonic indicators:
the ortho-para ratios of H2O and CH4, and an upper-limit for the D/H ratio in water.
The abundance ratios of almost all trace volatiles (relative to water) are among
the highest ever observed in a comet. The comet also revealed a complex outgassing
pattern, with some volatiles (the polar species H2O and CH3OH) presenting very
asymmetric spatial profiles (extended in the anti-sunward hemisphere), while others
(e.g., C2H6 and HCN) showed particularly symmetric profiles. We present emission
profiles measured along the Sun-comet line for all observed volatiles, and discuss
different production scenarios needed to explain them. We interpret the emission
profiles in terms of release from two distinct moieties of ice, the first being
clumps of mixed ice and dust released from the nucleus into the sunward hemisphere.
The second moiety considered is very small grains of nearly pure polar ice (water
and methanol, without dark material or apolar volatiles). Such grains would sublimate
only very slowly, and could be swept into the anti-sunward hemisphere by radiation
pressure and solar-actuated non-gravitational jet forces, thus providing an extended
source in the anti-sunward hemisphere. },

Lille and Cologne in the millimetre region at 160–600 GHz and 850–903 GHz, respectively.
The results of these millimetre wave measurements were combined with the 21, 31, 41,
and 61 infrared energy levels, which were obtained from previous analysis of FTS
spectra of the ν4 (out of plane bending mode), ν6 (CH2 rock mode), and ν3 (CH2
bending mode) bands recorded in the 10 µm region (D.C. Reuter, S. Nadler, S.J.
Daunt, and J.W.C. Johns. J. Chem. Phys. 91, 646 (1989)) and more recently for
the ν2 fundamental band (C=O stretching, located at 1746.009 cm–1) (F. Kwabia
Tchana, A. Perrin, and N. Lacome. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 245, 141, (2007)). The energy
level calculation of the 21, 31, 41, and 61 interacting states accounts for the
various Coriolis-type resonances that perturb the energy levels of the 21, 31, 41,
and 61 vibrational states as well as for the anharmonic resonances coupling the 21
and 31 energy levels, and in this way the microwave and infrared data could be
reproduced within their associated experimental uncertainty. However, it is clear
that the theoretical model used to account for the very large A-type Coriolis
resonance linking the 41 and 61 energy levels of H2CO is only effective with poor
physical meaning.},

scattering (fs-CARS) is used to investigate the strongly perturbed ν1 ro-vibrational
Raman band of formaldehyde (H2CO). The time-dependent signal is simulated using
a ‘Watson-’Hamiltonian in A-type reduction and Raman theory for asymmetric rotors.
The results are compared with the experimental data. The fs-CARS method measures
the evolution of the polarization in a molecular ensemble via superposition of many
states and is sensitive to spectral irregularities or line shifts of the involved
transitions. ‘Coriolis’ interactions play a major role in the analysis of the ν1
band of formaldehyde. We successfully simulate the fs-CARS transient signal from
the ν1 band of formaldehyde including a model for multiple ‘Coriolis’ interactions,
without the necessity of describing the complete interaction between all the vibrational
levels. ‘Coriolis’ coupling coefficients and energy shifts are derived from the
experiment by a least-square fit. The results are discussed and compared to literature
values.},

	Aperture synthesis maps of H 2 CO at 3 mm were made using the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland

	indicate that the production rate of H 2 CO is 3.7 × 10 28 s -1

	the comet-Sun direction. This result suggests a source of H 2 CO
	other than the comet nucleus. The extended source of formaldehyde
	is probably grains composed of a mixture of silicates and organic
	material. The production rate for H 2 CO increases to Q 1.4 × 10

	I. Heterogeneous Hydrogenation of CO and H2CO on Icy Grain Mantles}},

abstract = {Formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and methanol (CH 3 OH) are thought to be produced
	in the interstellar medium by the successive hydrogenation of carbon
	monoxide (CO) on grain surfaces. In the gas phase, the steps in which
	H adds to CO and H 2 CO possess modest barriers and are too inefficient
	to account for the observed abundances. Recent laboratory work has
	confirmed that formaldehyde and methanol are formed when H atoms
	are deposited on CO ice at 12 K. The present study employs ab initio
	quantum chemical calculations to investigate the impact of water
	ice on the sequential hydrogenation of CO. The most favorable pathway
	is CO → HCO (formyl radical) → H 2 CO → CH 3 O (methoxy radical)
	→ CH 3 OH. There is sufficient reaction energy in the final step
	to fragment CH 3 OH into methyl and hydroxyl radicals, which can
	be hydrogenated to yield methane and water, as observed in the experimental
	work. The emphasis here was on the two steps with barriers, H + CO
	and H + H 2 CO, with both addition and abstraction considered for
	the latter. Calculations with up to four explicit water molecules
	were performed, as well as further modeling to incorporate bulk effects.
	While ice was found to have a nearly negligible impact on H + CO
	→ HCO, it modestly enhances the addition reaction H + H 2 CO →
	CH 3 O and hinders the abstraction reaction H + H 2 CO → H 2 +
	HCO. The deuterium-substituted reactions D + CO → DCO and D + H
	2 CO → CDH 2 O were found to be slightly favored over the corresponding
	H reactions, particularly in the latter case. Overall, the energetics
	are not favorable: water ice is evidently not a good catalytic substrate
	for H + CO or H + H 2 CO addition reactions at very cold temperatures.},

abstract = {A variational procedure for rovibrational energy levels and wavefunctions
of centrally connected tetra-atomic molecules is extended to include high rotational
states, and in particular, J ⩽ 10 levels for the vibrational ground state of formaldehyde.
It is very important to do this because it has made possible the calculation of the
usual rotational spectroscopic constants which correspond to the forcefield and
geometry. A direct comparison with the ‘observed’ spectroscopic constants is therefore
possible. The geometry and forcefield are refined against 65 J = 0 levels of H2CO,
6 J = 0 levels of D2CO, 42 J = 1, 70 J = 2 and 98 J = 3 levels of the ground and
fundamentals of H2CO and D2CO, using an iterative scheme. The mean absolute error
of the J = 0 levels is 1·10 cm−1 and that for J ≠ 0 is 0·005 cm−1, and the predicted
geometry is CH = 1·10064 Å, CO = 1·20296 Å and HCO = 121·648°. Finally, the rotational
constants A, B, and C for the ground state are 281956, 38846 and 34003 MHz, compared
with the observed values 281971, 38836, and 34002 MHz. The centrifugal distortion
constants ΔJ , ΔJK , ΔK and δJ , are 77, 1275, 18113 and 11 kHz compared with 75,
1291, 19422 and 10 kHz. These results underline the accuracy of the new quartic

Pages = {282-298},
Abstract = {The physical characteristics of a molecular cloud which relate most
   closely to star formation within it occur on the finest spatial scales.
   Generally, several transitions of a specific molecule must be mapped to
   securely determine molecular cloud physics. Toward this goal,
   interferometric observations of the 1(10) --> 1(11) and 5(14) --> 5(15)
   transitions of H2CO have been made toward the Orion-KL molecular cloud.
   With synthesized beamwidths of 5.1'' (2400 AU) and 7.6'' (3500 AU),
   respectively, we identify emission from the `' hot core,'' `'compact
   ridge,'' and `'northern cloud'' regions. We also detect 1(10) <-- 1(11)
   H2CO absorption toward the `'Orion-S'' region. These 1(10) --> 1(11) and
   5(14 --> 5(15) emission measurements have been combined with 6''
   resolution measurements of the 2(11) --> 2(12) transition of H2CO
   (Mangum et al. 1990) in a spherical large velocity gradient model of the
   H2CO excitation to derive the H-2 density and H2CO column density in the
   hot core, compact ridge, and northern cloud. Typical peak densities lie
   in the range (3-8) x 10(5) cm-3, with H2CO column densities in the range
   10(16)-10(17) cm-2. Highest spatial densities but lowest column
   densities occur in the northern cloud, while lowest spatial densities
   but highest column densities characterize the compact ridge. A critical
   discussion of H2CO as a spatial density probe demonstrates that the
   K-doublet transitions provide an excellent spatial density probe,
   attaining substantial optical depths only at the highest column densities.},

abstract = {It is now possible to calculate the nine-dimensional rovibrational
wavefunctions of sequentially bonded four-atom molecules variationally without
dynamical approximation. In the case of HCCH, the simplest such molecule, many
hundreds of rovibrational (J = 0, 1, 2) levels can be converged to better than 1.5 cm −1.
Variational calculations of this kind are used here systematically to refine the
well-known quartic valence-coordinate forcefleld of Strey and Mills [J.Mol.
Spectrosc.59, 103-115 (1976)] against experimental term values up to three C-H
stretch quanta for the principal and two deuterated isotopomers, yielding a new
surface that reproduces the energies of all the known Σ, Π, and Δ states of these
species up to the energy of two C-H stretch quanta with an rms error of 3 cm−1 .
The refined forcefield is used to study the resonances associated with the accidental
degeneracies (ν2 + ν4 + ν5, ν3) and (ν2 + 2ν5, ν1) in the principal isotopomer, leading
to a clarification of the assignment of she experimentally detected states in
the 2ν3 and 3ν3, polyads, and to the finding that vibrational Coriolis (kinetic energy)
terms, rather than quartic anharmonicities in the potential, are the primary cause of
the resonant interactions. Using a new cubic ab initio electric dipole field to
calculate IR absorption coefficients, 24 undetected Σ and Π states of 1H12C12C1H
and 5 undetected Σ states of D12C12CD are identified as candidates for experimental
study, and their calculated energies and assignments are given.},

year = {1993},
volume = {99},
pages = {8519-8541},
abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
	levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The
	method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
	of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
	iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
	vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
	as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions
	in each off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more
	than cn(f+1) multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates.
	Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation
	(DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal.
	The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by
	the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions)
	at most two. The n(f+1) scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed
	second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to
	any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety
	of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond),
	for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic
	energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged
	band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1,
	and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results
	for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify the causes of discrepancies
	in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices
	(up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within
	an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using
	explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule
	and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos
	method to all the examples presented here with a single computer
	program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality,
	and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly
	with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

In the case of formaldehyde, the data enable changes in all three structural parameters
due to isotopic mass effects to be determined. For ethylene, only the change in
CH bond length on deuteration is well characterized, due to the somewhat lower
accuracy in the rotational constants. Using isotopic structural differences transferred
from formaldehyde, and supported by calculations, ground-state rotational constants
for all deutero isotopes of ethylene are predicted to what is considered to be better
than 0·1 per cent reliability. The change in CH bond length on deuteration in ethylene
is less than in formaldehyde. This is supported by calculations, although it appears
also that the CH bond stretching coordinate in formaldehyde is more anharmonic
than that in ethylene. The equilibrium structures are predicted in terms of the
observed δr z(XH-XD) structural parameters. For formaldehyde, the structure accurately
reproduces the experimental equilibrium inertial constants of H2CO. For ethylene
the structure is in good agreement with that determined by making the corresponding
corrections to the independently determined electron diffraction rg structural parameters.},

is about 2×10 -7 cm -1 at 70 Gc, when the spectral lines are displayed on a cathode-ray
oscilloscope with a sweep rate of 1 cps. R -branch transitions 1 01 ←0 00 of the
formaldehyde isotopic species H 2 C 13 O, H 2 CO 18 , HDCO, D 2 CO, D 2 C 13 O
and D 2 CO 18 have been measured and their rotational constants have been determined.
The observed inertia defects of D 2 CO, H 2 C 13 O and H 2 CO 18 are shown to be
in good agreement with the predicted theoretical values. From the observed rotational
constants the r z -structures of formaldehyde are determined to be},

reported data for H2CO were analyzed by a digital computer by the use of Kivelson
and Wilson’s method for the centrifugal distortion correction. The asymmetry parameter
b and B–C were obtained for each isotopic species as follows:(Remark: Graphics omitted.)
It was found that the observed frequencies fit well to those calculated from the
centrifugal distortion constants which were derived by the vibration-rotation
interaction theory.},

coordinate analysis and the experimental intensities, the bond moments and their
derivatives have been calculated for the three symmetry species. The relative signs
of ∂μ/∂Q5 and ∂μ/∂Q6 have been determined from the investigation of the Coriolis
interaction between ν5 and ν6. The results chosen from the calculations are: μCH
