Abstract = {An investigation of the rotational spectrum of the interstellar molecule
   thioformaldehyde between 110 and 377 GHz through a pyrolysis reaction
   revealed a multitude of absorption lines assignable to H2CS and
   (H2CS)-S-34 in their lowest four excited vibrational states besides
   lines of numerous thioformaldehyde isotopologues in their ground
   vibrational states reported earlier as well as lines pertaining to
   several by-products. Additional transitions of H2CS in its lowest four
   excited vibrational states were recorded in selected regions between 571
   and 1386 GHz. Slight to strong Coriolis interactions occur between all
   four vibrational states with the exception of the two highest lying
   states because both are totally symmetric vibrations. We present
   combined analyses of the ground and the four interacting states for our
   rotational data of H2CS and (H2CS)-S-34. The H2CS data were supplemented
   with two sets of high-resolution IR data in two separate analyses. The
   v(2 )= 1 state has been included in analyses of Coriolis interactions of
   low-lying fundamental states of H2CS for the first time and this
   improved the quality of the fits substantially. We extended furthermore
   assignments in J of transition frequencies of thioketene in its ground
   vibrational state.},

Abstract = {A computed line list for formaldehyde, (H2CO)-C-12-O-16, applicable to
   temperatures up to T = 1500 K is presented. An empirical potential
   energy and ab initio dipole moment surfaces are used as the input to the
   nuclear motion program TROVE. The resulting line list, referred to as
   AYTY, contains 10.3 million rotational-vibrational states and around 10
   billion transition frequencies. Each transition includes associated
   Einstein-A coefficients and absolute transition intensities,
   forwavenumbers below 10000 cm(-1) and rotational excitations up to J =
   70. Room-temperature spectra are compared with laboratory measurements
   and data currently available in the HITRAN data base. These spectra show
   excellent agreement with experimental spectra and highlight the gaps and
   limitations of the HITRAN data. The full line list is available from the
   CDS data base as well as at www.exomol.com.},
