Abstract = {A computed line list for formaldehyde, (H2CO)-C-12-O-16, applicable to
   temperatures up to T = 1500 K is presented. An empirical potential
   energy and ab initio dipole moment surfaces are used as the input to the
   nuclear motion program TROVE. The resulting line list, referred to as
   AYTY, contains 10.3 million rotational-vibrational states and around 10
   billion transition frequencies. Each transition includes associated
   Einstein-A coefficients and absolute transition intensities,
   forwavenumbers below 10000 cm(-1) and rotational excitations up to J =
   70. Room-temperature spectra are compared with laboratory measurements
   and data currently available in the HITRAN data base. These spectra show
   excellent agreement with experimental spectra and highlight the gaps and
   limitations of the HITRAN data. The full line list is available from the
   CDS data base as well as at www.exomol.com.},
