Journal = AJ,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {876},
pages = {72},
abstract = {The nature and abundance of sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks (PPDs)
may impact the sulfur inventory on young planets and therefore their habitability.
PPDs also offer an interesting test bed for sulfur chemistry models, since each
disk shows a diverse set of environments. In this context, we present new sulfur
molecule observations in PPDs and new S-disk chemistry models. With the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array we observed the CS 5â€“4 rotational transition
toward five PPDs (DM Tau, DO Tau, CI Tau, LkCa 15, MWC 480) and the CS 6â€“5 transition
toward three PPDs (LkCa 15, MWC 480, and V4046 Sgr). Across this sample, CS displays
a range of radial distributions, from centrally peaked to gaps and rings. We also
present the first detection in PPDs of 13CS 6â€“5 (LkCa 15 and MWC 480), C34S 6â€“5 (LkCa 15),
and H2CS 817â€“716, 919â€“818, and 918â€“817 (MWC 480) transitions. Using LTE models to
constrain column densities and excitation temperatures, we find that either 13C
and 34S are enhanced in CS or CS is optically thick despite its relatively low
brightness temperature. Additional lines and higher spatial resolution observations
are needed to distinguish between these scenarios. Assuming that CS is optically thin,
CS column density model predictions reproduce the observations within a factor of a
few for both MWC 480 and LkCa 15. However, the model underpredicts H2CS by 1â€“2
orders of magnitude. Finally, comparing the H2CS/CS ratio observed toward the MWC 480
disk and toward different interstellar medium sources, we find the closest match
with prestellar cores.},

	Chirped and non-chirped linear polarized pulses were tried as well

Title = {{Theoretical rotation-vibration spectrum of thioformaldehyde}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {139},
pages = {204308},
Abstract = {We present a variational calculation of the first comprehensive T = 300
   K rovibrational line list for thioformaldehyde, H2CS. It covers 41 809
   rovibrational levels for states up to J(max) = 30 with vibrational band
   origins up to 5000 cm(-1) and provides the energies and line intensities
   for 547 926 transitions from the ground vibrational state to these
   levels. It is based on our previously reported accurate ab initio
   potential energy surface and a newly calculated ab initio dipole moment
   surface. Minor empirical adjustments are made to the ab initio
   equilibrium geometry to reduce systematic errors in the predicted
   intra-band rotational energy levels. The rovibrational energy levels and
   transition intensities are computed variationally by using the methods
   implemented in the computer program TROVE. Transition wavelengths and
   intensities are found to be in excellent agreement with the available
   experimental data. The present calculations correctly reproduce the
   observed resonance effects, such as intensity borrowing, thus reflecting
   the high accuracy of the underlying ab initio surfaces. We report a
   detailed analysis of several vibrational bands, especially those
   complicated by strong Coriolis coupling, to facilitate future laboratory
   assignments. },

	abstract = {Pure rotational transitions have been measured for the normal isotopologue of thioformaldehyde, H212C32S , in the ground vibrational state in the 110-370 GHz, 570-670 GHz, and 850-930 GHz frequency ranges. A global data set has been constructed consisting of prior microwave and millimeter-wave transitions, the submillimeter-wave and terahertz (THz) transitions reported here, and far-infrared data and ground state combination differences. The 783 different transition frequencies in the data set were fit to Watson’s S-reduced Hamiltonian with 20 parameters, resulting in a dimensionless weighted root-mean-square deviation of 0.78. New frequency predictions have been made for astronomical observations based on the molecular parameters obtained in the present study.}
