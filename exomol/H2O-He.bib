Abstract = {The vibrational spectroscopy of the water dimer provides an
   understanding of basic hydrogen bonding in water clusters, and with
   about one water dimer for every 1,000 water molecules, it plays a
   critical role in atmospheric science. Here, we review how the
   experimental and theoretical progress of the past decades has improved
   our understanding of water dimer vibrational spectroscopy under both
   cold and warm conditions. We focus on the intramolecular OH-stretching
   transitions of the donor unit, because these are the ones mostly
   affected by dimer formation and because their assignment has proven a
   challenge. We review cold experimental results from early matrix
   isolation to recent mass-selected jet expansion techniques and, in
   parallel, the improvements in the theoretical anharmonic models. We
   discuss and illustrate changes in the vibrational spectra of complexes
   upon increasing temperature, and the difficulties in recording and
   calculating these spectra. In the atmosphere, water dimer spectra at
   ambient temperature are crucial.},
