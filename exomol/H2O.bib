    abstract = {We present atmospheric retrievals from Keck/KPIC Phase II observations of the ultrahot Jupiter (UHJ) KELT-20/MASCARA-2 b. Previous free retrievals of molecular abundances for UHJs have been impacted by significant model biases due to variations in vertical abundance profiles, which we address by including molecular dissociation into our retrieval framework as an additional free parameter. We measure the abundance of CO () and obtain a lower limit on the abundance of H2O (, &gt;−3.0 at 95% confidence) in the atmosphere of KELT-20 b. These abundances yield an atmospheric  (C/O &lt; 0.9 at 95% confidence) and suggest a metallicity approximately solar to 10 × solar. H2O is dissociated at pressures below  bar, roughly consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models, and suggesting that the retrieved composition is not a result of assumptions about the vertical mixing profiles. We also constrain the rotational velocity of KELT-20 b to  km s−1, suggesting the presence of a jet comparable to the sound speed in the direction of the planet’s rotation, assuming the actual rotation of the planet is tidally locked.}

Raman spectroscopy represents a promising non-contact method for developing highly accurate humidity measurement instruments. However, the Raman spectrum of water vapor is sensitive to variations in external conditions typical of transported NG. These spectral changes must be taken into account to achieve high measurement accuracy. This paper presents the first investigation of the Raman spectrum of water vapor in gaseous methane, covering both vibrational bands (ν1 and ν3) and pure rotational lines of water. The methane-broadening and shift coefficients of water spectral lines were measured. The magnitude of pressure-broadening for anisotropic water lines in methane was found to be comparable to that induced by atmospheric air. The obtained results can be utilized to improve the accuracy of water vapor concentration retrieval from Raman spectra.}

   characterization, and with it, the possibility to detect potential
   biosignature gases like CH4. Our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric
   spectra, and the veracity of these interpretations, will be limited by
   our understanding of atmospheric processes and the accuracy of input
   modeling data. Molecular cross sections are essential inputs to these
   models. The photochemistry of temperate planets depends on photolysis
   reactions whose rates are governed by the dissociation cross sections of
   key molecules. H2O is one such molecule; the photolysis of H2O produces
   OH, a highly reactive and efficient sink for atmospheric trace gases. We
   investigate the photochemical effects of improved H2O cross sections on
   anoxic terrestrial planets as a function of host star spectral type and
   CH4 surface flux. Our results show that updated H2O cross sections,
   extended to wavelengths >200 nm, substantially impact the predicted
   abundances of trace gases destroyed by OH. The differences for anoxic
   terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like host stars are greatest, showing
   changes of up to 3 orders of magnitude in surface CO levels, and over an
   order of magnitude in surface CH4 levels. These differences lead to
   observable changes in simulated planetary spectra, especially important
   in the context of future direct-imaging missions. In contrast, the
   atmospheres of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are substantially less

Almost all current global chemistry models calculate about 15\% too much OH and thus too rapid methane loss. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer, critical to achieving global warming targets, and this error affects our model projections of climate change. New observations of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet region (290 to 350 nanometers) imply reductions in sunlight with key photolysis rates decreasing by 8 to 12\% in the near-surface tropical atmosphere. Incorporation of this new mechanism in a chemistry-transport model reduces OH and methane loss by only 4\%, but combined with other proposed mechanisms, such as tropospheric halogen chemistry (7\%), we may be able to resolve this conundrum. Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, so understanding its atmospheric chemistry is essential for the development of models to successfully project climate change. Current models uniformly underestimate the atmospheric lifetime of methane because they uniformly overestimate how much hydroxyl radical (OH), the chemical species responsible for most of the destruction of methane, the atmosphere contains. Prather and Zhu investigated the cause of this discrepancy and report that it is due in part to a previously unrecognized pathway 
of water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet that causes models to calculate OH concentrations that are too high and thus methane lifetimes that are too short. —Jesse Smith}

Twenty-nine datasets were collected at temperatures between 300 and 1300 K (±0.82% average uncertainty) and pressures ranging from 20 to 600 Torr (±0.25%) with an average residual absorbance noise of 8.0E-4 across the spectrum for all measurements. We fit measurements using a quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profile to determine 7088 absorption parameters for 3366 individual transitions found in HITRAN2020. These measurements build on the line strength, line center, self-broadening, and self-shift parameters determined in the Part I companion of this work. Here we measure air-broadened width (with temperature- and speed-dependence) and air pressure shift (with temperature-dependence) parameters. Various trends are explored for extrapolation to weak transitions that were not covered in this work. Improvements made in this work are predominantly due to the inclusion of air pressure shift temperature dependence values. In aggregate, these updates improved RMS absorbance error by a factor of 4.2 on average, and the remaining residual is predominantly spectral noise.

    abstract = {The absorption of atmospheric water vapor gradually weakens from the
   microwave to the visible band, but the absorption in the ultraviolet
   band has been ignored. Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption
   Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is a passive optical remote sensing technology
   that can simultaneously retrieve a variety of trace gases such as NO2,
   SO2, HCHO, HONO and water vapor. It is often used for regional
   atmospheric three-dimensional distribution and transportation
   monitoring, and has the characteristics of low cost, high time
   resolution stability, and real-time monitoring. Water vapor is an
   important greenhouse gas, and the water vapor absorption in the
   ultraviolet band is often not considered when we retrieve trace gases,
   which may affect the retrieval of trace gases in the ultraviolet band,
   resulting in systematic errors. This study introduced the atmospheric
   water vapor retrieval in the ultraviolet band using MAX-DOAS
   observations in Qianxian, Xi' an, from June 1 to September 24, 2020. The
   optimal retrieval band in ultraviolet and visible were selected and
   compared. The comparison results confirmed the water vapor absorption in
   the ultraviolet band, and we also evaluated the influence of ultraviolet
   water vapor absorption on the retrieval of trace gases in the same band.
   First, the optimal retrieval bands for water vapor in the ultraviolet
   (351 similar to 370 nm) and visible blue bands (434 similar to 455 nm)
   were selected according to the root mean square (RMS) and the absorption
   cross-sections of H2O and O-4. Secondly, the O-4 and H2O DSCD in the
   ultraviolet and visible blue bands were obtained by DOAS fitting, and
   the correlation between the two bands was analyzed. The two bands'
   correlation coefficient of O-4 and H2O DSCD in the two bands were 0. 85
   and 0. 80. The ratio of O-4 and H2O DSCD in the same band has also been
   analyzed, and the correlation coefficient in the two bands was 0. 89.
   The high correlation coefficients of H2O DSCD and the ratio of H2O
   DSCD/O-4 DSCD in the ultraviolet and visible blue bands indicate that
   even Xi' an, which has a lower water vapor concentration relative to
   coastal cities, also has water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet band
   near 363 nm. It will affect the retrieval of other trace gases in the
   ultraviolet band using DOAS technology. Finally, the retrieval errors of
   gases (O-4, HONO, and HCHO) that may be affected by water vapor
   absorption in the ultraviolet band were evaluated. The water vapor
   absorption in the ultraviolet band will increase O-4 DSCD, HONO DSCD,
   and HCHO DSCD during the fitting process, corresponding to the changes
   of +1. 16\%, +8. 55 \%, and +9. 04\%, respectively.},

   has been tested against the mid-infrared water emission, we reinterpret
   the CO2 emission as observed with Spitzer. We find that both water
   UV-shielding and extra chemical heating significantly reduce the total
   CO2 column in the emitting layer. Water UV-shielding is the more
   efficient effect, reducing the CO2 column by similar to 2 orders of
   magnitude. These lower CO2 abundances lead to CO2-to-H2O flux ratios
   that are closer to the observed values, but CO2 emission is still too
   bright, especially in relative terms. Invoking the depletion of
   elemental oxygen outside of the water midplane ice line more strongly
   impacts the CO2 emission than it does the H2O emission, bringing the
   CO2-to-H2O emission in line with the observed values. We conclude that
   the CO2 emission observed with Spitzer-IRS is coming from a thin layer
   in the photosphere of the disk, similar to the strong water lines. Below
   this layer, we expect CO2 not to be present except when replenished by a
   physical process. This would be visible in the (CO2)-C-13 spectrum as
   well as certain (CO2)-C-12 features that can be observed by JWST-MIRI.},

   detected in the disk atmosphere, for example, CO, CO2, H2O, and C2H2,
   are theoretically enough to constrain the C/O ratio on the disk surface.
   However, thermochemical models have difficulties in reproducing the full
   array of detected species in the mid-infrared simultaneously. In an
   effort to get closer to the observed spectra, we have included water
   UV-shielding as well as more efficient chemical heating into the
   thermochemical code Dust and Lines. We find that both are required to
   match the observed emission spectrum. Efficient chemical heating, in
   addition to traditional heating from UV photons, is necessary to elevate
   the temperature of the water-emitting layer to match the observed
   excitation temperature of water. We find that water UV-shielding stops
   UV photons from reaching deep into the disk, cooling down the lower
   layers with a higher column. These two effects create a hot emitting
   layer of water with a column of 1-10 x 10(18) cm(-2). This is only

   Very recently, using an improved methodology, the sets of empirical

   referenced to a frequency comb (FC), newly obtained in the 8040-8630

   superposition of the FC-CRDS spectra to the W2020 line list of H-2 O-16
   shows a number of large disagreements. Cases where deviations largely

   global procedure and algorithm elaborated to identify and adequately
   weight inaccurate line positions among the large W2020 transition

   higher quality data sources.

Earth and planetary atmospheres provide only electric-dipole transitions for polyatomic
molecules (H2O{,} CO2{,} N2O{,} CH4{,} O3à). Very recently{,} electric-quadrupole
transitions have been detected in the high sensitivity cavity ring down spectrum (CRDS)

023091 DOI:10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023091]. This discovery paved the way to systematic
searches of quadrupole transitions in water vapor and other polyatomic molecules.
In the present work{,} on the basis of high accuracy ab initio predictions{,} H216O
quadrupole lines are detected for the first time in the 5.4 ╡m and 2.5 ╡m regions
where they are predicted to have their largest intensities (up to 10-26 cm/molecule).
A total of twelve quadrupole lines are identified in two high sensitivity Fourier
transform spectra recorded with a 1064 m path length. Ten lines in the 4030 - 4150
cm-1 region are assigned to the n3 band while the lines near 1820 and 1926 cm-1
belong to the 2 band. The derived line intensities which are largely above the
dipole intensity cut-off of the standard spectroscopic databases{,} agree nicely
with the theoretical predictions. We thus conclude that the calculated line list
of quadrupole transitions{,} validated by the present measurements{,} should be i
ncorporated in the spectroscopic databases.},

    abstract = {We present a study of the photochemistry of abiotic habitable planets
with anoxic CO2–N2 atmospheres. Such worlds are representative of early Earth, Mars,
and Venus and analogous exoplanets. Photodissociation of H2O controls the atmospheric
photochemistry of these worlds through production of reactive OH, which dominates
the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV; >200 nm) absorption cross
sections of H2O play an outsized role in OH production; these cross sections were
heretofore unmeasured at habitable temperatures (<373 K). We present the first
measurements of NUV H2O absorption at 292 K and show it to absorb orders of magnitude
more than previously assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross sections,
we employ a photochemical model; we first intercompare it with two others and resolve
past literature disagreement. The enhanced OH production due to these higher cross
sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O2, suppressing both by orders
of magnitude relative to past predictions and eliminating the low-outgassing “false-positive”
scenario for O2 as a biosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases
rainout of reductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may
also suppress CH4 and H2; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants is
inhibited on the underlying planet, as is argued for abiotic worlds. While we focus
on CO2-rich worlds, our results are relevant to anoxic planets in general. Overall,
our work advances the state of the art of photochemical models by providing crucial
new H2O cross sections and resolving past disagreement in the literature and suggests
that detection of spectrally active trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres
may be more challenging than previously considered.},

   and obtained water vapor absorption cross sections at 1-nm increments in

   over this range with maximum and minimum cross sections of 8.4 x 10(-25)

   spectra have spectral structures resembling the differential

    abstract = {We report on a new high temperature solar receiver concept which
   exploits the ability of some molecular gases such as water vapor or
   carbon dioxide to absorb a significant fraction of longer wavelength
   thermal radiation while being mostly transparent to terrestrial solar
   radiation. The receiver operation principle is similar to the
   ``greenhouse effect{''}: It relies on a gas volume between an aperture
   and a black surface heated by solar radiation to absorb the thermal
   re-radiation of the surface and shield the aperture from it. At the same
   time, the gas is heated by such absorption and acts as heat transfer
   fluid (HTF). The receiver works with radiation only as heat transfer
   mechanism and does not require, a priori, any convective contribution.
   To demonstrate the potential of the approach we modelled the system with
   the most accurate method available, spectral line-by-line (LBL) photon
   Monte Carlo raytracing with the absorption coefficients derived from the
   HITEMP 2010 spectroscopic database. We applied the model to a
   cylindrical cavity geometry with an axial gas flow. We simulated the
   performance for a large 16 m diameter, 16 m-long near-ambient pressure
   receiver with and without window at the 100 m(2)-aperture. The gases
   considered as HTF were steam, CO2, and mixtures of them. The gas outlet
   temperature was varied between 1000 K and 2000 K. We also simulated a
   small 1.6 m diameter, 1.6 m-long cylindrical cavity receiver with a 1
   m(2) windowed aperture and pressurized steam at 10 bar. With a solar
   irradiation flux of 1200 kW/m(2) at the aperture, the receiver
   efficiency remained above 80\% for gas outlet temperatures up to 1800 K
   for all receivers operated with steam. Carbon dioxide led to lower
   efficiencies, but water-rich mixtures of H2O and CO2 performed closely
   as good as pure steam. The proposed receiver concept represents a new
   opportunity towards low-cost high temperature solar technologies for
   processes beyond 1000 K.},

   superior conjunction. We detect the signature of molecular absorption by
   water at a significance of 5.6 sigma at a systemic velocity of V-sys =
   -33 +/- 2 km s(-1), coincident with the 51 Peg host star, with a
   corresponding orbital velocity = K-P 133(-3.5)(+4.3) km s(-1). This
   translates directly to a planet mass of = Mp 0.476(-0.031)(+0.032)M(J),
   placing it at the transition boundary between Jovian and Neptunian
   worlds. We determine upper and lower limits on the orbital inclination
   of the system of 70 degrees< i < 82 degrees.2. We also provide an
   updated orbital solution for 51 Peg b, using an extensive set of 639
   stellar radial velocities measured between 1994 and 2013, finding no
   significant evidence of an eccentric orbit. We find no evidence of
   significant absorption or emission from other major carbon-bearing
   molecules of the planet, including methane and carbon dioxide. The
   atmosphere is non-inverted in the temperature-pressure region probed by
   these observations. The deepest absorption lines reach an observed
   relative contrast of 0.9 x 10(-3) with respect to the host star
   continuum flux at an angular separation of 3 milliarcseconds. This work
   is consistent with a previous tentative report of K-band molecular
   absorption for 51 Peg b by Brogi et al.},

   The achieved sensitivity of the recordings (noise equivalent absorption,
   alpha(mm), on the order of 2 x 10(-19) cm(-1)) allowed detecting
   transitions with intensity values down to 1 x 10-29 cm(-1) molecule,
   more than one order of magnitude better than previous studies by Fourier
   Transform Spectroscopy. The rovibrational assignment was performed on
   the basis of variational calculations and of previously determined
   empirical energy values. Most of the newly assigned lines correspond to
   transitions of the v(1), v(3) and 3v(2) bands of H-2 O-17 in natural
   isotopic abundance. Fourteen energy levels of H-2 O-17, H-2 O-18 and HD
   O-18 are newly determined.
   An accurate and complete spectroscopic database is constructed for
   natural water in the 4190-4550 cm(-1) region (239-2.20 pm). The list
   includes about 4500 transitions with intensity greater than 1 x 10(-29)
   cm/molecule, for the six most abundant isotopologues in natural isotopic
   abundance. Line positions were obtained by difference of empirical
   energy values determined from literature data and complemented with the
   present CRDS results. The list is made mostly complete by including weak
   transitions not yet detected, with positions calculated from empirical
   levels and variational intensities. The variational intensities computed
   by a collaboration between the University College London and the

   significantly previous results by Schwenke and Partridge. Examples of

   modulation of the sample, are consistent with a range of H2O mixing
   ratios and cloud-top pressures, with a minimum H2O mixing ratio of

   planet formation. Thus observationally measuring the location of the H2O
   snowline is crucial for understanding the planetesimal and planet

   We used tens of thousands of radiative transfer models of both

   density, kinetic temperature and dust temperature. Results, in the form
   of maser optical depths, have been summarized in a master table. Maser
   transitions identified in these models were grouped according to loci of
   inverted regions in the density/kinetic temperature plane, a property
   clearly related to the dominant mode of pumping. A more detailed study
   of the effect of dust temperature on maser optical depth enabled us to
   divide the maser transitions into three groups: those with both
   collisional and radiative pumping schemes ( 22, 96, 209, 321, 325, 395,
   941 and 1486 GHz), a much larger set that are predominantly radiatively

    pages = {A28},
    abstract = {Context. The structures of the outer atmospheres of red giants are very
   complex. Recent interpretations of a range of different observations
   have led to contradictory views of these regions. It is clear, however,
   that classical model photospheres are inadequate to describe the nature
   of the outer atmospheres. The notion of large optically thick molecular
   spheres around the stars (MOLspheres) has been invoked in order to
   explain spectro-interferometric observations and low-and high-resolution
   spectra. On the other hand high-resolution spectra in the mid-IR do not
   easily fit into this picture because they rule out any large sphere of
   water vapour in LTE surrounding red giants.   Aims. In order to approach a unified scenario for these outer regions of
   red giants, more empirical evidence from different diagnostics are
   needed. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-IR spectra
   for a range of red giants, spanning spectral types from early K to mid
   M. We want to study how the pure rotational lines of water vapour change
   with effective temperature, and whether we can find common properties
   that can put new constraints on the modelling of these regions, so that
   we can gain new insights.
   Methods. We have recorded mid-IR spectra at 12.2-12.4 mu m at high
   spectral resolution of ten well-studied bright red giants, with TEXES
   mounted on the IRTF on Mauna Kea. These stars span effective
   temperatures from 3450 K to 4850 K.
   Results. We find that all red giants in our study cooler than 4300 K,
   spanning a wide range of effective temperatures (down to 3450 K), show
   water absorption lines stronger than expected and none are detected in
   emission, in line with what has been previously observed for a few
   stars. The strengths of the lines vary smoothly with spectral type. We
   identify several spectral features in the wavelength region that are
   undoubtedly formed in the photosphere. From a study of water-line ratios
   of the stars, we find that the excitation temperatures, in the
   line-forming regions, are several hundred Kelvin lower than expected
   from a classical photospheric model.
   Conclusions. All stars in our sample show several photospheric features
   in their 12 mu m spectra, which can be modelled with a classical model
   photosphere. However, in all stars showing water-vapour lines (stars
   cooler than similar to 4300 K), the water lines are found to be much
   deeper than expected. The line ratios of these pure-rotational lines
   reveal low excitation temperatures. This could either be due to lower
   temperatures than expected in the outer regions of the photospheres
   caused by for example extra cooling, or due to non-LTE level
   populations, affecting the source function and line opacities, but this
   needs further investigation. We have demonstrated that these
   diagnostically interesting water lines are a general feature of red
   giants across spectral types, and we argue for a general explanation of
   their formation rather than explanations requiring specific properties,
   such as dust. Since the water lines are neither weak (filled in by
   emission) nor do they appear in emission, as predicted by LTE MOLsphere
   models in their simplest forms, the evidence of the existence of such
   large optically-thick, molecular spheres enshrouding the stars is
   weakened. It is still a challenge to find a unifying picture of the
   outer regions of the atmospheres of red giants, but we have presented
   new empirical evidence that needs to be taken into account and explained
   in any model of these regions.},

    abstract = {Measurements of the atmospheric HDO/H2O ratio help us to better
   understand the hydrological cycle and improve models to correctly
   simulate tropospheric humidity and therefore climate change. We present
   an updated version of the column-averaged HDO/H2O ratio data set from
   the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric
   CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). The data set is extended with 2 additional
   years, now covering 2003-2007, and is validated against co-located
   ground-based total column (delta D) over bar measurements from Fourier
   transform spectrometers (FTS) of the Total Carbon Column Observing
   Network (TCCON) and the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric
   Composition Change (NDACC, produced within the framework of the MUSICA
   project). Even though the time overlap among the available data is not
   yet ideal, we determined a mean negative bias in SCIAMACHY (delta D)
   over bar of -35 +/- 30\% compared to TCCON and -69 +/- 15\% compared to
   MUSICA (the uncertainty indicating the station-to-station standard
   deviation). The bias shows a latitudinal dependency, being largest
   (similar to-60 to -80 parts per thousand) at the highest latitudes and
   smallest (similar to-20 to -30\%) at the lowest latitudes. We have
   tested the impact of an offset correction to the SCIAMACHY HDO and H2O
   columns. This correction leads to a humidity-and latitude-dependent
   shift in (delta D) over bar and an improvement of the bias by 27 parts
   per thousand, although it does not lead to an improved correlation with
   the FTS measurements nor to a strong reduction of the latitudinal
   dependency of the bias. The correction might be an improvement for dry,
   high-altitude areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau and the Andes region.
   For these areas, however, validation is currently impossible due to a
   lack of ground stations. The mean standard deviation of single-sounding
   SCIAMACHY-FTS differences is similar to 115 parts per thousand, which is
   reduced by a factor similar to 2 when we consider monthly means. When we
   relax the strict matching of individual measurements and focus on the
   mean seasonalities using all available FTS data, we find that the
   correlation coefficients between SCIAMACHY and the FTS networks improve
   from 0.2 to 0.7-0.8. Certain ground stations show a clear asymmetry in
   (delta D) over bar during the transition from the dry to the wet season
   and back, which is also detected by SCIAMACHY. This asymmetry points to
   a transition in the source region temperature or location of the water
   vapour and shows the added information that HDO/H2O measurements provide
   when used in combination with variations in humidity.},

   Other detected species include CO, (CO)-C-13, (H2O)-O-18, SiO, HCN, SO,

   (CO)-C-13 line intensities yield a C-12/C-13 ratio of 5.6 +/- 1.8,
   consistent with measurements of this ratio for other M-supergiants, but
   significantly lower than previously estimated for VY CMa from

   20 SiO rotational lines shows two temperature components: a hot
   component at similar to 1000 K, which we attribute to the stellar
   atmosphere and inner wind, plus a cooler similar to 200 K component,

   along with a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1). To fit
   the high rotational lines of CO and H2O, the model required a rather
   flat temperature distribution inside the dust condensation radius,
   attributed to the high H2O opacity. Beyond the dust condensation radius
   the gas temperature is fitted best by an r(-0.5) radial dependence,
   consistent with the coolant lines becoming optically thin. Our H2O
   emission-line fits are consistent with an ortho: para ratio of 3 in the

   From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets
   evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little
   hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to
   observe the composition of these atmospheres(1-5). Here we report
   observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b

   wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at
   a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption
   (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary
   atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to
   about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large
   scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of
   e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the
   abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar
   value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of

   1.8 on the extent of any isotope-selective enhancement of (H2O)-O-17 in

   self-shielding can only have reduced the (CO)-C-12-O-16

   the blue spectral range is similar over land and ocean, water vapour
   retrievals are more consistent than for longer wavelengths. Compared to
   retrievals at longer wavelengths, the sensitivity for atmospheric layers
   close to the surface is higher due to the (typically 2 to 3 times)
   higher ocean albedo in the blue. Water vapour retrievals in the blue
   spectral range are also possible for satellite sensors, which do not
   measure at longer wavelengths of the visible spectral range like the
   Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We investigated details of the water

    abstract = {The water vapour continuum is characterised by absorption that varies
smoothly with wavelength, from the visible to the microwave. It is present within
the rotational and vibrational--rotational bands of water vapour, which consist
of large numbers of narrow spectral lines, and in the many `windows' between
these bands. The continuum absorption in the window regions is of particular
importance for the Earth's radiation budget and for remote-sensing techniques
that exploit these windows. Historically, most attention has focused on
the 8--12 $\mu$m (mid-infrared) atmospheric window, where the continuum is
relatively well-characterised, but there have been many fewer measurements
within bands and in other window regions. In addition, the causes of the continuum
remain a subject of controversy. This paper provides a brief historical overview
of the development of understanding of the continuum and then reviews recent
developments, with a focus on the near-infrared spectral region. Recent laboratory
measurements in near-infrared windows, which reveal absorption typically an order
of magnitude stronger than in widely used continuum models, are shown to have
important consequences for remote-sensing techniques that use these windows for
retrieving cloud properties.},

CO2 with ∼20%. All other absorbers play only minor roles. In a doubled CO2

of the total greenhouse effect is significantly larger than the initial radiative

    journal = ApJ,
    year = {2006},
    volume = {645},
    pages = {652-658},
    abstract = {Several recent papers have argued for warm, semidetached, molecular
   layers surrounding red giant and supergiant stars, a concept known as a
   MOLsphere. Spectroscopic and interferometric analyses have often
   corroborated this general picture. Here we present high-resolution
   spectroscopic data of pure rotational lines of water vapor at 12 mu m
   for the supergiant mu Cep. This star has often been used to test the
   concept of molecular layers around supergiants. Given the prediction of
   an isothermal, optically thick water vapor layer in local thermodynamic
   equilibrium around the star ( MOLsphere), we expected the 12 mu m lines
   to be in emission or at least in absorption but filled in by emission
   from the molecular layer around the star. Our data, however, show the
   contrary; we find definite absorption. Thus, our data do not easily fit
   into the suggested isothermal MOLsphere scenario. The 12 mu m lines,
   therefore, put new, strong constraints on the MOLsphere concept and on
   the nature of water seen in signatures across the spectra of early M
   supergiants. We also find that the absorption is even stronger than that
   calculated from a standard, spherically symmetric model photosphere
   without any surrounding layers. A cool model photosphere, representing
   cool outer layers, is, however, able to reproduce the lines, but this
   model does not account for water vapor emission at 6 mu m. Thus, a
   unified model for water vapor on mu Cep appears to be lacking. It does
   seem necessary to model the underlying photospheres of these supergiants
   in their whole complexity. The strong water vapor lines clearly reveal
   inadequacies of classical model atmospheres.},

    journal = {J. Hydrology},
    year = {2006},
    volume = {319},
    pages = {83-95},
    abstract = {One of the more important questions in hydrology is: if the climate
warms in the future, will there be an intensification of the water cycle and, if
so, the nature of that intensification? There is considerable interest in this
question because an intensification of the water cycle may lead to changes in
water-resource availability, an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical
storms, floods, and droughts, and an amplification of warming through the water
vapor feedback. Empirical evidence for ongoing intensification of the water cycle
would provide additional support for the theoretical framework that links
intensification with warming. This paper briefly reviews the current state of
science regarding historical trends in hydrologic variables, including precipitation,
runoff, tropospheric water vapor, soil moisture, glacier mass balance, evaporation,
evapotranspiration, and growing season length. Data are often incomplete in spatial
and temporal domains and regional analyses are variable and sometimes contradictory;
however, the weight of evidence indicates an ongoing intensification of the water
cycle. In contrast to these trends, the empirical evidence to date does not consistently
support an increase in the frequency or intensity of tropical storms and floods.},

   involving the (A) over tilde state, which is degenerate with (B) over
   tilde at the conical intersections, is successful globally, provided
   that an appropriate choice of coordinates is made. Long range damping of
   non-adiabatic coupling to give correct asymptotic mixing angles also is
   investigated.},

Jensen, and Tennyson, [J. Chem. Phys. 101, 7651 (1994)]. By also modifying the
former to reproduce the Coulombic behavior at the collapsed molecular limits for
vanishingly small interatomic distances and approximately account for the long
range forces, the new potential energy surface has been given double many‐body
expansion quality. The result is a global H2O potential energy surface which has
spectroscopic accuracy and may be used for studies of reaction dynamics.},

representation (DVR) for the symmetrized Radau coordinates. Vibrational eigenstates
are computed from the DVR Hvib via the successive diagonalization/truncation technique.
A comparison of the computed eigenvalues with those observed demonstrate the accuracy
of our model. Highly excited vibrational states, up to 30 000 cm−1 above the zero‐point
energy, are reported for the potential energy surface (PES) given by Jensen
[J. Mol. Phys., 133, 438 (1989)]. Using natural orbital expansions, the eigenfunctions
of vibrational states are analyzed to understand the origins of the dynamical mixing
of the vibrational modes. The local/normal mode transitions, Fermi resonances,
Darling–Dennison interactions, and the mode separabilities are investigated.
Statistical studies on the energy level spacings are presented for two different
types of PES.},
