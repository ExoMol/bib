Title = {Measurement of Water Vapor Absorption in the Ultraviolet Band Using
   MAX-DOAS and Evaluation of Its Influence on DOAS Retrieval},
Journal = {SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {3314-3320},
Abstract = {The absorption of atmospheric water vapor gradually weakens from the
   microwave to the visible band, but the absorption in the ultraviolet
   band has been ignored. Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption
   Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is a passive optical remote sensing technology
   that can simultaneously retrieve a variety of trace gases such as NO2,
   SO2, HCHO, HONO and water vapor. It is often used for regional
   atmospheric three-dimensional distribution and transportation
   monitoring, and has the characteristics of low cost, high time
   resolution stability, and real-time monitoring. Water vapor is an
   important greenhouse gas, and the water vapor absorption in the
   ultraviolet band is often not considered when we retrieve trace gases,
   which may affect the retrieval of trace gases in the ultraviolet band,
   resulting in systematic errors. This study introduced the atmospheric
   water vapor retrieval in the ultraviolet band using MAX-DOAS
   observations in Qianxian, Xi' an, from June 1 to September 24, 2020. The
   optimal retrieval band in ultraviolet and visible were selected and
   compared. The comparison results confirmed the water vapor absorption in
   the ultraviolet band, and we also evaluated the influence of ultraviolet
   water vapor absorption on the retrieval of trace gases in the same band.
   First, the optimal retrieval bands for water vapor in the ultraviolet
   (351 similar to 370 nm) and visible blue bands (434 similar to 455 nm)
   were selected according to the root mean square (RMS) and the absorption
   cross-sections of H2O and O-4. Secondly, the O-4 and H2O DSCD in the
   ultraviolet and visible blue bands were obtained by DOAS fitting, and
   the correlation between the two bands was analyzed. The two bands'
   correlation coefficient of O-4 and H2O DSCD in the two bands were 0. 85
   and 0. 80. The ratio of O-4 and H2O DSCD in the same band has also been
   analyzed, and the correlation coefficient in the two bands was 0. 89.
   The high correlation coefficients of H2O DSCD and the ratio of H2O
   DSCD/O-4 DSCD in the ultraviolet and visible blue bands indicate that
   even Xi' an, which has a lower water vapor concentration relative to
   coastal cities, also has water vapor absorption in the ultraviolet band
   near 363 nm. It will affect the retrieval of other trace gases in the
   ultraviolet band using DOAS technology. Finally, the retrieval errors of
   gases (O-4, HONO, and HCHO) that may be affected by water vapor
   absorption in the ultraviolet band were evaluated. The water vapor
   absorption in the ultraviolet band will increase O-4 DSCD, HONO DSCD,
   and HCHO DSCD during the fitting process, corresponding to the changes
   of +1. 16\%, +8. 55 \%, and +9. 04\%, respectively.},

Title = {{General Analytical Nuclear Forces and Molecular Potential Energy Surface
   from Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo}},
Journal = JCTC,
Abstract = {The full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) is a
   state-of-the-art stochastic electronic structure method, providing a
   methodology to compute FCI-level state energies of molecular systems
   within a quantum chemical basis. However, especially to probe dynamics
   at the FCIQMC level, it is necessary to devise more efficient schemes to
   produce nuclear forces and potential energy surfaces (PES) from FCIQMC.
   In this work, we derive the general formula for nuclear forces from
   FCIQMC, and clarify different contributions of the total force. This
   method to obtain FCIQMC forces eliminates previous restrictions and can
   be used with frozen core approximation and free selection of orbitals,
   making it promising for more efficient nuclear forces calculations.
   After some numerical checks of this procedure on the binding curve of
   N-2 molecule, we use the FCIQMC energy and force to obtain the
   full-dimensional ground state PES of the water molecule via Gaussian
   processes regression. The new water FCIQMC PES can be used as the basis
   for H2O ground state nuclear dynamics, structure optimization, and
   rotation-vibrational spectrum calculation.},

Title = {{Water UV-shielding in the Terrestrial Planet-forming Zone: Implications
   for Carbon Dioxide Emission}},
Journal = {ApJL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {933},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide is an important tracer of the chemistry and physics in
   the terrestrial planet-forming zone. Using a thermochemical model that
   has been tested against the mid-infrared water emission, we reinterpret
   the CO2 emission as observed with Spitzer. We find that both water
   UV-shielding and extra chemical heating significantly reduce the total
   CO2 column in the emitting layer. Water UV-shielding is the more
   efficient effect, reducing the CO2 column by similar to 2 orders of
   magnitude. These lower CO2 abundances lead to CO2-to-H2O flux ratios
   that are closer to the observed values, but CO2 emission is still too
   bright, especially in relative terms. Invoking the depletion of
   elemental oxygen outside of the water midplane ice line more strongly
   impacts the CO2 emission than it does the H2O emission, bringing the
   CO2-to-H2O emission in line with the observed values. We conclude that
   the CO2 emission observed with Spitzer-IRS is coming from a thin layer
   in the photosphere of the disk, similar to the strong water lines. Below
   this layer, we expect CO2 not to be present except when replenished by a
   physical process. This would be visible in the (CO2)-C-13 spectrum as
   well as certain (CO2)-C-12 features that can be observed by JWST-MIRI.},

Title = {Water UV-shielding in the Terrestrial Planet-forming Zone: Implications
   from Water Emission},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {930},
Abstract = {Mid-infrared spectroscopy is one of the few ways to observe the
   composition of the terrestrial planet-forming zone, the inner few
   astronomical units, of protoplanetary disks. The species currently
   detected in the disk atmosphere, for example, CO, CO2, H2O, and C2H2,
   are theoretically enough to constrain the C/O ratio on the disk surface.
   However, thermochemical models have difficulties in reproducing the full
   array of detected species in the mid-infrared simultaneously. In an
   effort to get closer to the observed spectra, we have included water
   UV-shielding as well as more efficient chemical heating into the
   thermochemical code Dust and Lines. We find that both are required to
   match the observed emission spectrum. Efficient chemical heating, in
   addition to traditional heating from UV photons, is necessary to elevate
   the temperature of the water-emitting layer to match the observed
   excitation temperature of water. We find that water UV-shielding stops
   UV photons from reaching deep into the disk, cooling down the lower
   layers with a higher column. These two effects create a hot emitting
   layer of water with a column of 1-10 x 10(18) cm(-2). This is only
   1\%-10\% of the water column above the dust tau = 1 surface at
   mid-infrared wavelengths in the models and represents <1\% of the total
   water column.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{276}},
Abstract = {{A decade ago, a task group of the International Union of Pure and
   Applied Chemistry performed an ex-haustive collection and review of
   measured transitions, applied the MARVEL procedure, and derived
   rec-ommended empirical energy levels for nine major water isotopologues.
   Very recently, using an improved methodology, the sets of empirical
   energy levels of H-2 O-16, H-2 O-18 and H-2 O-17 were updated, leading
   to the so-called W2020 energy levels and transition wavenumbers
   {[}Furtenbacher et al. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 49 (2020) 043103;
   10.1063/5.0030680].
   Here we present validation tests of the W2020 line list of H-2 O-16
   against spectra recorded by cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS)
   referenced to a frequency comb (FC), newly obtained in the 8040-8630
   cm(-1) region. The recorded spectra are found in excellent agreement
   with previous high-quality studies available in the literature. While
   these literature sources were all incorporated in the transition
   database used to derive the W2020 energy levels, the direct
   superposition of the FC-CRDS spectra to the W2020 line list of H-2 O-16
   shows a number of large disagreements. Cases where deviations largely
   exceed the W2020 claimed uncertainty on the transition frequencies are
   noted. In the considered spectral region, the resulting W2020 list is
   thus less accurate than some of the published original sources used to
   derive the W2020 energy levels. We conclude that the sophisticated
   global procedure and algorithm elaborated to identify and adequately
   weight inaccurate line positions among the large W2020 transition
   database do not always prevent less accurate data from ``spoiling{''}
   higher quality data sources.
   The W2020 list of H-2 O-16 is also compared to newly recorded CRDS
   spectra in the 12970-13200 cm(-1) region (corresponding to the region of
   the A-band of O-2 ), where previous observations were very scarce. As in
   the previous region, substantial position deviations are evidenced, and
   in many cases, the W2020 error bars appear to be strongly
   underestimated. }},

   structure of both nuclear-spin isomers of (H2O)-O-18 is established with
   an average accuracy of 2.5 kHz. Altogether, 195 carefully selected
   rovibrational transitions are probed. The ultrahigh sensitivity of
   NICE-OHMS permits the observation of lines with room-temperature
   absorption intensities as low as 10(-27) cm molecule(-1), while the
   superb resolution enables the detection of a doublet with a separation
   of only 286(17) kHz. While the NICE-OHMS experiments are performed in
   the near-infrared window of 7000-7350 cm(-1), the lines observed allow
   the determination of all the pure rotational energies of (H2O)-O-18
   corresponding to J values up to 8, where J is the total rotational
   quantum number. Both network and quantum theory have been employed to
   facilitate the measurement campaign and the full exploitation of the
   lines resolved. For example, to minimize the experimental effort, the
   transitions targeted for observation were selected via the
   spectroscopic-network-assisted precision spectroscopy (SNAPS) scheme
   built upon the extended Ritz principle, the theory of spectroscopic
   networks, and an underlying dataset of quantum chemical origin. To
   ensure the overall connection of the ultraprecise rovibrational lines
   for both nuclear-spin isomers of (H2O)-O-18, the NICE-OHMS transitions
   are augmented with six accurate microwave lines taken from the
   literature. To produce absolute ortho-(H2O)-O-18 energies, the lowest
   ortho energy is determined to be 23.754 904 61(19) cm(-1). A reference,
   benchmark-quality line list of 1546 transitions, deduced from the
   ultrahigh-accuracy energy values determined in this study, provides

   revolutionized molecular spectroscopy: their combination allows
   recording saturated Doppler-free lines with ultrahigh precision. Network
   theory, based on the generalized Ritz principle, offers a powerful tool
   for the intelligent design and validation of such precision-spectroscopy
   experiments and the subsequent derivation of accurate energy
   differences. As a proof of concept, 156 carefully-selected near-infrared
   transitions are detected for (H2O)-O-16, a benchmark system of molecular
   spectroscopy, at kHz accuracy. These measurements, augmented with 28
   extremely-accurate literature lines to ensure overall connectivity,
   allow the precise determination of the lowest ortho-(H2O)-O-16 energy,
   now set at 23.794 361 22(25) cm(-1), and 160 energy levels with
   similarly high accuracy. Based on the limited number of observed
   transitions, 1219 calibration-quality lines are obtained in a wide
   wavenumber interval, which can be used to improve spectroscopic
   databases and applied to frequency metrology, astrophysics, atmospheric
   sensing, and combustion chemistry.}},

abstract  = {Nowadays{,} the spectroscopic databases used for the modeling of the
Earth and planetary atmospheres provide only electric-dipole transitions for polyatomic
molecules (H2O{,} CO2{,} N2O{,} CH4{,} O3à). Very recently{,} electric-quadrupole
transitions have been detected in the high sensitivity cavity ring down spectrum (CRDS)
of water vapour near 1.3 ╡m [A. Campargue et al. Phys. Rev. Res.{,} 2020{,} 2{,}
023091 DOI:10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023091]. This discovery paved the way to systematic
searches of quadrupole transitions in water vapor and other polyatomic molecules.
In the present work{,} on the basis of high accuracy ab initio predictions{,} H216O
quadrupole lines are detected for the first time in the 5.4 ╡m and 2.5 ╡m regions
where they are predicted to have their largest intensities (up to 10-26 cm/molecule).
A total of twelve quadrupole lines are identified in two high sensitivity Fourier
transform spectra recorded with a 1064 m path length. Ten lines in the 4030 - 4150
cm-1 region are assigned to the n3 band while the lines near 1820 and 1926 cm-1
belong to the 2 band. The derived line intensities which are largely above the
dipole intensity cut-off of the standard spectroscopic databases{,} agree nicely
with the theoretical predictions. We thus conclude that the calculated line list
of quadrupole transitions{,} validated by the present measurements{,} should be i
ncorporated in the spectroscopic databases.},

of New H$_2$O Cross-Sections}},

pages = {148},
abstract = {We present a study of the photochemistry of abiotic habitable planets
with anoxic CO2–N2 atmospheres. Such worlds are representative of early Earth, Mars,
and Venus and analogous exoplanets. Photodissociation of H2O controls the atmospheric
photochemistry of these worlds through production of reactive OH, which dominates
the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV; >200 nm) absorption cross
sections of H2O play an outsized role in OH production; these cross sections were
heretofore unmeasured at habitable temperatures (<373 K). We present the first
measurements of NUV H2O absorption at 292 K and show it to absorb orders of magnitude
more than previously assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross sections,
we employ a photochemical model; we first intercompare it with two others and resolve
past literature disagreement. The enhanced OH production due to these higher cross
sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O2, suppressing both by orders
of magnitude relative to past predictions and eliminating the low-outgassing “false-positive”
scenario for O2 as a biosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases
rainout of reductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may
also suppress CH4 and H2; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants is
inhibited on the underlying planet, as is argued for abiotic worlds. While we focus
on CO2-rich worlds, our results are relevant to anoxic planets in general. Overall,
our work advances the state of the art of photochemical models by providing crucial
new H2O cross sections and resolving past disagreement in the literature and suggests
that detection of spectrally active trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres
may be more challenging than previously considered.},

Journal = JGRA,

volume = {124},
pages = {14310-14324},
Abstract = {Absorption of solar radiation by water vapor in the near-UV region is a
   poorly understood but important issue in atmospheric science. To better
   understand water vapor near-UV absorption, we constructed a cavity
   ring-down spectrometer with bandwidth of 5 cm(-1) (similar to 0.05 nm)
   and obtained water vapor absorption cross sections at 1-nm increments in
   the 290- to 350-nm region. Water vapor displays structured absorption
   over this range with maximum and minimum cross sections of 8.4 x 10(-25)
   and 1.6 x 10(-25) cm(2)/molecule. Major water vapor absorption bands
   were observed at 293-295, 307-313, 319, 321-322, and 325 nm, with
   cross-section values higher than 4.0 x 10(-25) cm(2)/molecule. To obtain
   further insight into major water vapor absorption bands, we measured
   water vapor absorption cross sections at 0.05-nm intervals in the 292-
   to 296-nm, 306- to 314-nm, and 317- to 326-nm region. Field UV residual
   spectra not only exhibited increased attenuation at higher atmospheric
   water vapor loadings but also showed structures suggested by the
   laboratory water vapor absorption spectrum. Spaceborne UV radiance
   spectra have spectral structures resembling the differential
   cross-section spectrum constructed from the laboratory
   wavelength-dependent water vapor absorption cross sections presented
   here. Incorporating water vapor absorption cross-section data into a
   radiative transfer model yielded an estimated energy budget of 0.26
   W/m(2) for the standard U.S. atmosphere and 0.76 W/m(2) for the tropics.
   This shows that water vapor near-UV absorption is an important
   contributor for climate simulation and ozone retrievals.},

   gas as heat transfer fluid and reduced radiative losses}},
Journal = {Solar Energy},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {183},
Pages = {521-531},
Abstract = {We report on a new high temperature solar receiver concept which
   exploits the ability of some molecular gases such as water vapor or
   carbon dioxide to absorb a significant fraction of longer wavelength
   thermal radiation while being mostly transparent to terrestrial solar
   radiation. The receiver operation principle is similar to the
   ``greenhouse effect{''}: It relies on a gas volume between an aperture
   and a black surface heated by solar radiation to absorb the thermal
   re-radiation of the surface and shield the aperture from it. At the same
   time, the gas is heated by such absorption and acts as heat transfer
   fluid (HTF). The receiver works with radiation only as heat transfer
   mechanism and does not require, a priori, any convective contribution.
   To demonstrate the potential of the approach we modelled the system with
   the most accurate method available, spectral line-by-line (LBL) photon
   Monte Carlo raytracing with the absorption coefficients derived from the
   HITEMP 2010 spectroscopic database. We applied the model to a
   cylindrical cavity geometry with an axial gas flow. We simulated the
   performance for a large 16 m diameter, 16 m-long near-ambient pressure
   receiver with and without window at the 100 m(2)-aperture. The gases
   considered as HTF were steam, CO2, and mixtures of them. The gas outlet
   temperature was varied between 1000 K and 2000 K. We also simulated a
   small 1.6 m diameter, 1.6 m-long cylindrical cavity receiver with a 1
   m(2) windowed aperture and pressurized steam at 10 bar. With a solar
   irradiation flux of 1200 kW/m(2) at the aperture, the receiver
   efficiency remained above 80\% for gas outlet temperatures up to 1800 K
   for all receivers operated with steam. Carbon dioxide led to lower
   efficiencies, but water-rich mixtures of H2O and CO2 performed closely
   as good as pure steam. The proposed receiver concept represents a new
   opportunity towards low-cost high temperature solar technologies for
   processes beyond 1000 K.},

   comb, transition frequencies are determined down to 100 Hz precision and
   kHz accuracy. The developed setup allows resolving highly K-type blended
   doublets separated by about 10 MHz (to be compared to a HWHM Doppler

Abstract = {We report the detection of water absorption features in the day side
   spectrum of the first-known hot Jupiter, 51 Peg b, confirming the
   star-planet system to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We use
   high-resolution ( R approximate to 100,000), 3.2 mu m spectra taken with
   CRIRES/VLT to trace the radial-velocity shift of the water features in
   the planet's day side atmosphere during 4 hr of its 4.23 day orbit after
   superior conjunction. We detect the signature of molecular absorption by
   water at a significance of 5.6 sigma at a systemic velocity of V-sys =
   -33 +/- 2 km s(-1), coincident with the 51 Peg host star, with a
   corresponding orbital velocity = K-P 133(-3.5)(+4.3) km s(-1). This
   translates directly to a planet mass of = Mp 0.476(-0.031)(+0.032)M(J),
   placing it at the transition boundary between Jovian and Neptunian
   worlds. We determine upper and lower limits on the orbital inclination
   of the system of 70 degrees< i < 82 degrees.2. We also provide an
   updated orbital solution for 51 Peg b, using an extensive set of 639
   stellar radial velocities measured between 1994 and 2013, finding no
   significant evidence of an eccentric orbit. We find no evidence of
   significant absorption or emission from other major carbon-bearing
   molecules of the planet, including methane and carbon dioxide. The
   atmosphere is non-inverted in the temperature-pressure region probed by
   these observations. The deepest absorption lines reach an observed
   relative contrast of 0.9 x 10(-3) with respect to the host star
   continuum flux at an angular separation of 3 milliarcseconds. This work

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2017},
Volume = {189},
Pages = {407-416},
Abstract = {The weak absorption spectrum of water vapor in the important 2.2 mu m
   transparency window is investigated with very high sensitivity. Overall,
   about 400 absorption lines were measured by Cavity Ring Down
   Spectroscopy (CRDS) and Optical-Feedback-Cavity Enhanced Laser
   Spectroscopy (OF-CEAS) in five spectral intervals: 4248.2-4257.3,
   4298.4-4302.6, 4336.8.5-4367.5, 4422.4-4441.2 and 4514.6-4533.7 cm(-1).
   The achieved sensitivity of the recordings (noise equivalent absorption,
   alpha(mm), on the order of 2 x 10(-19) cm(-1)) allowed detecting
   transitions with intensity values down to 1 x 10-29 cm(-1) molecule,
   more than one order of magnitude better than previous studies by Fourier
   Transform Spectroscopy. The rovibrational assignment was performed on
   the basis of variational calculations and of previously determined
   empirical energy values. Most of the newly assigned lines correspond to
   transitions of the v(1), v(3) and 3v(2) bands of H-2 O-17 in natural
   isotopic abundance. Fourteen energy levels of H-2 O-17, H-2 O-18 and HD
   O-18 are newly determined.
   An accurate and complete spectroscopic database is constructed for
   natural water in the 4190-4550 cm(-1) region (239-2.20 pm). The list
   includes about 4500 transitions with intensity greater than 1 x 10(-29)
   cm/molecule, for the six most abundant isotopologues in natural isotopic
   abundance. Line positions were obtained by difference of empirical
   energy values determined from literature data and complemented with the
   present CRDS results. The list is made mostly complete by including weak
   transitions not yet detected, with positions calculated from empirical
   levels and variational intensities. The variational intensities computed
   by a collaboration between the University College London and the
   Institute of Applied Physics in Nizhny Novgorod are found to improve
   significantly previous results by Schwenke and Partridge. Examples of
   comparison of the constructed line list to CADS spectra and to
   simulations based on the HITRAN2012 list illustrate the advantages of
   the new list. The absence of many HDO lines is identified as most
   important deficiency of the HITRAN2012 list in the region.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {817},

Abstract = {We present an observational study of the vibrationally excited H2O line
   at 658 GHz (v(2) = 1, 1(1,0)-1(0,1)) toward Orion KL using the Atacama
   Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). This line is clearly
   detected at the position of the massive protostar candidate, Source I.
   The spatial structure is compact, with a size of about 100 AU, and is
   elongated along the northeast-southwest low-velocity (18 km(-1)) bipolar
   outflow traced by 22 GHz H2O masers, SiO masers, and thermal SiO lines.
   A velocity gradient can be seen perpendicular to the bipolar outflow.
   The overall spatial and velocity structure seems to be analogous to that
   of the 321 GHz H2O maser line previously detected with ALMA and
   vibrationally excited SiO maser emission. The brightness temperature of
   the 658 GHz H2O line is estimated to be higher than 2 x 10(4) K,
   implying that it is emitted via maser action. Our results suggest that
   the 658 GHz H2O maser line is emitted from the base of the outflow from
   a rotating and expanding accretion disk as observed for the SiO masers
   and the 321 GHz H2O maser. We also search for two other H2O lines at 646
   GHz (9(7,3)-8(8,0) and 9(7,2)-8(8,1)), but they are not detected in
   Orion KL.},

   majority of HST/WFC3 exoplanet observationS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {823},
pages = {109},
Abstract = {Currently, 19 transiting exoplanets have published transmission spectra
   obtained with the Hubble/WFC3 G141 near-IR grism. Using this sample, we
   have undertaken a uniform analysis incorporating measurement-error
   debiasing of the spectral modulation due to H2O, measured in terms of
   the estimated atmospheric scale height, H-s. For those planets with a
   reported H2O detection (10 out of 19), the spectral modulation due to
   H2O ranges from 0.9 to 2.9 H-s with a mean value of 1.8 +/- 0.5 H-s.
   This spectral modulation is significantly less than predicted for clear
   atmospheres. For the group of planets in which H2O has been detected, we
   find the individual spectra can be coherently averaged to produce a
   characteristic spectrum in which the shape, together with the spectral
   modulation of the sample, are consistent with a range of H2O mixing
   ratios and cloud-top pressures, with a minimum H2O mixing ratio of
   17(6)(+12) ppm corresponding to the cloud-free case. Using this lower
   limit, we show that clouds or aerosols must block at least half of the
   atmospheric column that would otherwise be sampled by transmission
   spectroscopy in the case of a cloud-free atmosphere. We conclude that
   terminator-region clouds with sufficient opacity to be opaque in
   slant-viewing geometry are common in hot Jupiters.},

abstract = {Inside the H2O snowline of protoplanetary disks, water evaporates from
   the dust-grain surface into the gas phase, whereas it is frozen out onto
   the dust in the cold region beyond the snowline. H2O ice enhances the
   solid material in the cold outer part of a disk, which promotes the
   formation of gas-giant planet cores. We can regard the H2O snowline as
   the surface that divides the regions between rocky and gaseous giant
   planet formation. Thus observationally measuring the location of the H2O
   snowline is crucial for understanding the planetesimal and planet
   formation processes, and the origin of water on Earth. In this paper, we
   find candidate water lines to locate the H2O snowline through future
   high-dispersion spectroscopic observations. First, we calculate the
   chemical composition of the disk and investigate the abundance
   distributions of H2O gas and ice, and the position of the H2O snowline.
   We confirm that the abundance of H2O gas is high not only in the hot
   midplane region inside the H2O snowline but also in the hot surface
   layer of the outer disk. Second, we calculate the H2O line profiles and
   identify those H2O lines that. are promising for locating the H2O
   snowline: the identified lines are those that have small Einstein A
   coefficients and high upper state energies. The wavelengths of the
   candidate H2O lines range from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter, and they
   overlap with the regions accessible to the Atacama Large
   Millimeter/submillimeter Array and future mid-infrared high-dispersion

calculate a maximum optical depth of 0.02 arising from absorption of water vapor

Journal = MNRAS,

Pages = {374-404},
Abstract = {We present the results of models that were designed to study all
   possible water maser transitions in the frequency range 0-1.91 THz, with
   particular emphasis on maser transitions that may be generated in
   evolved-star envelopes and observed with the ALMA and SOFIA telescopes.
   We used tens of thousands of radiative transfer models of both
   spin-species of H2O, spanning a considerable parameter space in number
   density, kinetic temperature and dust temperature. Results, in the form
   of maser optical depths, have been summarized in a master table. Maser
   transitions identified in these models were grouped according to loci of
   inverted regions in the density/kinetic temperature plane, a property
   clearly related to the dominant mode of pumping. A more detailed study
   of the effect of dust temperature on maser optical depth enabled us to
   divide the maser transitions into three groups: those with both
   collisional and radiative pumping schemes ( 22, 96, 209, 321, 325, 395,
   941 and 1486 GHz), a much larger set that are predominantly radiatively
   pumped, and another large group with a predominantly collisional pump.
   The effect of accelerative and decelerative velocity shifts of up to 5
   km s(-1) was found to be generally modest, with the primary effect of
   reducing computed maser optical depths. More subtle asymmetric effects,
   dependent on line overlap, include maximum gains offset from zero shift
   by > 1 km s(- 1), but these effects were predominantly found under
   conditions of weak amplification. These models will allow astronomers to
   use multitransition water maser observations to constrain physical
   conditions down to the size of individual masing clouds ( size of a few

Title = {{Systematic trend of water vapour absorption in red giant atmospheres
   revealed by high resolution TEXES 12 mu m spectra}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {573},
pages = {A28},
Abstract = {Context. The structures of the outer atmospheres of red giants are very
   complex. Recent interpretations of a range of different observations
   have led to contradictory views of these regions. It is clear, however,
   that classical model photospheres are inadequate to describe the nature
   of the outer atmospheres. The notion of large optically thick molecular
   spheres around the stars (MOLspheres) has been invoked in order to
   explain spectro-interferometric observations and low-and high-resolution
   spectra. On the other hand high-resolution spectra in the mid-IR do not
   easily fit into this picture because they rule out any large sphere of
   water vapour in LTE surrounding red giants.   Aims. In order to approach a unified scenario for these outer regions of
   red giants, more empirical evidence from different diagnostics are
   needed. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-IR spectra
   for a range of red giants, spanning spectral types from early K to mid
   M. We want to study how the pure rotational lines of water vapour change
   with effective temperature, and whether we can find common properties
   that can put new constraints on the modelling of these regions, so that
   we can gain new insights.
   Methods. We have recorded mid-IR spectra at 12.2-12.4 mu m at high
   spectral resolution of ten well-studied bright red giants, with TEXES
   mounted on the IRTF on Mauna Kea. These stars span effective
   temperatures from 3450 K to 4850 K.
   Results. We find that all red giants in our study cooler than 4300 K,
   spanning a wide range of effective temperatures (down to 3450 K), show
   water absorption lines stronger than expected and none are detected in
   emission, in line with what has been previously observed for a few
   stars. The strengths of the lines vary smoothly with spectral type. We
   identify several spectral features in the wavelength region that are
   undoubtedly formed in the photosphere. From a study of water-line ratios
   of the stars, we find that the excitation temperatures, in the
   line-forming regions, are several hundred Kelvin lower than expected
   from a classical photospheric model.
   Conclusions. All stars in our sample show several photospheric features
   in their 12 mu m spectra, which can be modelled with a classical model
   photosphere. However, in all stars showing water-vapour lines (stars
   cooler than similar to 4300 K), the water lines are found to be much
   deeper than expected. The line ratios of these pure-rotational lines
   reveal low excitation temperatures. This could either be due to lower
   temperatures than expected in the outer regions of the photospheres
   caused by for example extra cooling, or due to non-LTE level
   populations, affecting the source function and line opacities, but this
   needs further investigation. We have demonstrated that these
   diagnostically interesting water lines are a general feature of red
   giants across spectral types, and we argue for a general explanation of
   their formation rather than explanations requiring specific properties,
   such as dust. Since the water lines are neither weak (filled in by
   emission) nor do they appear in emission, as predicted by LTE MOLsphere
   models in their simplest forms, the evidence of the existence of such
   large optically-thick, molecular spheres enshrouding the stars is
   weakened. It is still a challenge to find a unifying picture of the
   outer regions of the atmospheres of red giants, but we have presented
   new empirical evidence that needs to be taken into account and explained
   in any model of these regions.},

of αmin~2×10–11 cm−1, more than two orders of magnitude better than previous
investigations by Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS). Measured line intensities
cover a range of seven orders of magnitude (3×10–30–2×10–23 cm/molecule at room

more than 5000 transitions. As a result of the achieved sensitivity, more
than 1150 lines of the experimental list were identified as being due to ammonia
present as an impurity at the 5 ppm concentration level in the water sample.
Although incomplete, the obtained ammonia line list seems to be the first one
in the region. More than 3193 water lines were assigned to 3560 transitions of
five water isotopologues (H216O, H218O, H217O, HD16O and HD18O). The assignments
were performed using known experimental energy levels and calculated spectra based
on variational calculations by Schwenke and Partridge. The obtained results are
compared to the most relevant previous studies by Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
in the region and to the exhaustive review of rovibrational line positions and
levels performed recently by an IUPAC sponsored task group. Two-hundred and sixty-six
levels are newly determined and 46 are corrected by more than 0.015 cm−1 compared
to those recommended by the water IUPAC task group. The overall agreement between
variational and measured intensities is satisfactory. A complete empirical list
of 4473 transitions incorporating all the experimental information at disposal

Abstract = {We present measurements of approximately 70 isolated, self-broadened,

   and which occur in the transparency window region from 7710 cm(-1) to
   7920 cm(-1). We acquired absorption spectra on room-temperature, water
   samples over the pressure range 150-800 Pa with the frequency-stabilized
   cavity ring-down spectroscopy technique. In order to optimize
   measurement accuracy, we integrated mK-level temperature control and
   SI-traceable pressure measurements into our cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy measurements. This technique yielded relative uncertainties
   of 0.04\% and 0.20\% in sample density and measured line intensity,
   respectively. We also referenced our spectrum frequency axes to a Cs
   clock, which provided vacuum line positions with a combined standard
   uncertainty of 3 MHz. Comparison of our measured intensities, positions
   and self-broadening parameters with literature values reveals that the
   present work substantially reduces uncertainty in these line parameters.
   For the (1,0,1)-(0,0,0) vibrational band, the measured line intensities
   agree at the 1\%-level with published ab initio calculations. Our
   spectra exhibited signal-to-noise ratios up to, approximate to 20,000:1
   to enable stringent tests of theoretical line profiles through
   multispectrum least-squares data analysis. We show that the partially
   correlated, quadratic-speed-dependent Nelkin-Ghatak profile gives a
   quality of fit that is commensurate with the high spectrum
   signal-to-noise ratio, and unlike most other profiles considered here,
   reproduces the measured line shapes without systematic residuals over
   the entire pressure range. Our results confirm that mechanisms of (1)
   collisional narrowing, (2) speed-dependent effects and (3) partial
   correlation between velocity-changing and dephasing collisions,
   contribute to the self-broadened line shape of isolated water vapor

   an updated version of the column-averaged HDO/H2O ratio data set from
   the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric
   CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). The data set is extended with 2 additional
   years, now covering 2003-2007, and is validated against co-located
   ground-based total column (delta D) over bar measurements from Fourier
   transform spectrometers (FTS) of the Total Carbon Column Observing
   Network (TCCON) and the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric
   Composition Change (NDACC, produced within the framework of the MUSICA
   project). Even though the time overlap among the available data is not
   yet ideal, we determined a mean negative bias in SCIAMACHY (delta D)
   over bar of -35 +/- 30\% compared to TCCON and -69 +/- 15\% compared to
   MUSICA (the uncertainty indicating the station-to-station standard
   deviation). The bias shows a latitudinal dependency, being largest
   (similar to-60 to -80 parts per thousand) at the highest latitudes and
   smallest (similar to-20 to -30\%) at the lowest latitudes. We have
   tested the impact of an offset correction to the SCIAMACHY HDO and H2O
   columns. This correction leads to a humidity-and latitude-dependent
   shift in (delta D) over bar and an improvement of the bias by 27 parts
   per thousand, although it does not lead to an improved correlation with
   the FTS measurements nor to a strong reduction of the latitudinal
   dependency of the bias. The correction might be an improvement for dry,
   high-altitude areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau and the Andes region.
   For these areas, however, validation is currently impossible due to a
   lack of ground stations. The mean standard deviation of single-sounding
   SCIAMACHY-FTS differences is similar to 115 parts per thousand, which is
   reduced by a factor similar to 2 when we consider monthly means. When we
   relax the strict matching of individual measurements and focus on the
   mean seasonalities using all available FTS data, we find that the
   correlation coefficients between SCIAMACHY and the FTS networks improve
   from 0.2 to 0.7-0.8. Certain ground stations show a clear asymmetry in
   (delta D) over bar during the transition from the dry to the wet season
   and back, which is also detected by SCIAMACHY. This asymmetry points to
   a transition in the source region temperature or location of the water
   vapour and shows the added information that HDO/H2O measurements provide
   when used in combination with variations in humidity.},

Title = {{Herschel SPIRE and PACS observations of the red supergiant VY CMa:
   analysis of the molecular line spectra}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {437},
Pages = {532-546},
Abstract = {We present an analysis of the far-infrared and submillimetre molecular
   emission-line spectrum of the luminous M-supergiant VY CMa, observed
   with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and
   Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer for Herschel spectrometers
   aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Over 260 emission lines were
   detected in the 190-650 mu m SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer
   spectra, with one-third of the observed lines being attributable to H2O.
   Other detected species include CO, (CO)-C-13, (H2O)-O-18, SiO, HCN, SO,
   SO2, CS, H2S and NH3. Our model fits to the observed (CO)-C-12 and
   (CO)-C-13 line intensities yield a C-12/C-13 ratio of 5.6 +/- 1.8,
   consistent with measurements of this ratio for other M-supergiants, but
   significantly lower than previously estimated for VY CMa from
   observations of lower-J lines. The spectral line energy distribution for
   20 SiO rotational lines shows two temperature components: a hot
   component at similar to 1000 K, which we attribute to the stellar
   atmosphere and inner wind, plus a cooler similar to 200 K component,
   which we attribute to an origin in the outer circumstellar envelope. We
   fit the line fluxes of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, H2O and SiO, using the
   SMMOL non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) line transfer code, with
   a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1) between 9R({*})
   and 350R({*}). We also fit the observed line fluxes of (CO)-C-12,
   (CO)-C-13, H2O and SiO with SMMOL non-LTE line radiative transfer code,
   along with a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1). To fit
   the high rotational lines of CO and H2O, the model required a rather
   flat temperature distribution inside the dust condensation radius,
   attributed to the high H2O opacity. Beyond the dust condensation radius
   the gas temperature is fitted best by an r(-0.5) radial dependence,
   consistent with the coolant lines becoming optically thin. Our H2O
   emission-line fits are consistent with an ortho: para ratio of 3 in the
   outflow.},

Title = {{Water vapor retrieval from OMI visible spectra}},
Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Tech.},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {1901-1913},
Abstract = {There are distinct spectral features of water vapor in the wavelength
   range covered by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) visible channel.
   Although these features are much weaker than those at longer
   wavelengths, they can be exploited to retrieve useful information about
   water vapor. They have an advantage in that their small optical depth
   leads to fairly simple interpretation as measurements of the total water
   vapor column density. We have used the Smithsonian Astrophysical
   Observatory (SAO) OMI operational retrieval algorithm to derive the
   slant column density (SCD) of water vapor using the 430-480 nm spectral
   region after extensive optimization. We convert from SCD to vertical
   column density (VCD) using the air mass factor (AMF), which is
   calculated using look-up tables of scattering weights and assimilated
   water vapor profiles. Our Level 2 product includes not only water vapor
   VCD but also the associated scattering weights and AMF. In the tropics,
   our standard water vapor product has a median SCD of 1.3x10(23)
   molecules cm(-2) and a median relative uncertainty of about 11 \%, about
   a factor of 2 better than that from a similar OMI algorithm that uses a
   narrower retrieval window. The corresponding median VCD is about
   1.2x10(23) molecules cm(-2). We have examined the sensitivities of SCD
   and AMF to various parameters and compared our results with those from
   the Glob-Vapour product, the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET).},

Abstract = {The HITEMP 2010 spectral emissivity database has been employed in line

   using the LBL based emissivity database, an accurate set of coefficients
   has been obtained for the weighted sum of gray gases model (WSGGM).
   Compared to the standard WSGGM, the present model includes the molar
   ratio of H2O-CO2 mixtures in its formulation which leads to one set of
   coefficients required to represent the entire range of molar ratio. This
   simplifies the implementation of the model in the simulation of
   radiative heat transfer in high inhomogeneous media providing higher

Title = {{Water vapour absorption in the clear atmosphere of a Neptune-sized
   exoplanet}},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {513},
Pages = {526},
Abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy has so far detected atomic and molecular
   absorption in Jupiter-sized exoplanets, but intense efforts to measure
   molecular absorption in the atmospheres of smaller (Neptune-sized)
   planets during transits have revealed only featureless spectra(1-4).
   From this it was concluded that the majority of small, warm planets
   evolve to sustain atmospheres with high mean molecular weights (little
   hydrogen), opaque clouds or scattering hazes, reducing our ability to
   observe the composition of these atmospheres(1-5). Here we report
   observations of the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HAT-P-11b
   (which has a radius about four times that of Earth) from the optical
   wavelength range to the infrared. We detected water vapour absorption at
   a wavelength of 1.4 micrometres. The amplitude of the water absorption
   (approximately 250 parts per million) indicates that the planetary
   atmosphere is predominantly clear down to an altitude corresponding to
   about 1 millibar, and sufficiently rich in hydrogen to have a large
   scale height (over which the atmospheric pressure varies by a factor of
   e). The spectrum is indicative of a planetary atmosphere in which the
   abundance of heavy elements is no greater than about 700 times the solar
   value. This is in good agreement with the core-accretion theory of
   planet formation, in which a gas giant planet acquires its atmosphere by
   accreting hydrogen-rich gas directly from the protoplanetary nebula onto
   a large rocky or icy core(6).},

Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {We report the results of a sensitive search for the minor isotopologues
   of water, (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18, toward the carbon-rich asymptotic
   giant branch star IRC+10216 (a.k.a. CW Leonis) using the HIFI instrument
   on the Herschel Space Observatory. This search was motivated by the fact
   that any detection of isotopic enhancement in the (H2O)-O-17 and
   (H2O)-O-18 abundances would have strongly implicated CO
   photodissociation as the source of the atomic oxygen needed to produce
   water in a carbon-rich circumstellar envelope. Our observations place an
   upper limit of 1/470 on the (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-16 abundance ratio.
   Given the isotopic O-17/O-16 ratio of 1/840 inferred previously for the
   photosphere of IRC+10216, this result places an upper limit of a factor
   1.8 on the extent of any isotope-selective enhancement of (H2O)-O-17 in
   the circumstellar material, and provides an important constraint on any
   model that invokes CO photodissociation as the source of O for H2O
   production. In the context of the clumpy photodissociation model
   proposed previously for the origin of water in IRC+10216, our limit
   implies that (CO)-C-12-O-16 ( not (CO)-C-13-O-16 or SiO) must be the
   dominant source of O-16 for H2O production, and that the effects of
   self-shielding can only have reduced the (CO)-C-12-O-16
   photodissociation rate by at most a factor similar to 2.},

Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Tech.},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {2593-2605},
Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for satellite retrievals of the atmospheric
   water vapour column in the blue spectral range. The water vapour
   absorption cross section in the blue spectral range is much weaker than
   in the red spectral range. Thus the detection limit and the uncertainty
   of individual observations are systematically larger than for retrievals
   at longer wavelengths. Nevertheless, water vapour retrievals in the blue
   spectral range have also several advantages: since the surface albedo in
   the blue spectral range is similar over land and ocean, water vapour
   retrievals are more consistent than for longer wavelengths. Compared to
   retrievals at longer wavelengths, the sensitivity for atmospheric layers
   close to the surface is higher due to the (typically 2 to 3 times)
   higher ocean albedo in the blue. Water vapour retrievals in the blue
   spectral range are also possible for satellite sensors, which do not
   measure at longer wavelengths of the visible spectral range like the
   Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We investigated details of the water
   vapour retrieval in the blue spectral range based on radiative transfer
   simulations and observations from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment
   2 (GOME-2) and OMI. It is demonstrated that it is possible to retrieve
   the atmospheric water vapour column density in the blue spectral range
   over most parts of the globe. The findings of our study are of

   position of the radio Source I, which is remarkably different from other

   velocities of -2.1 and 13.3 km s(-1). It appears to be consistent with
   the 22 GHz H2O masers and 43 GHz SiO masers observed around Source I.
   Thus, the 232 GHz H2O maser around Source I would be excited by the
   internal heating by an embedded protostar, being associated with either
   the root of the outflows/jets or the circumstellar disk around Source I,
   as traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers or 43 GHz SiO masers, respectively.},

abstract= {The water vapour continuum is characterised by absorption that varies
smoothly with wavelength, from the visible to the microwave. It is present within
the rotational and vibrational--rotational bands of water vapour, which consist
of large numbers of narrow spectral lines, and in the many `windows' between
these bands. The continuum absorption in the window regions is of particular
importance for the Earth's radiation budget and for remote-sensing techniques
that exploit these windows. Historically, most attention has focused on
the 8--12 $\mu$m (mid-infrared) atmospheric window, where the continuum is
relatively well-characterised, but there have been many fewer measurements
within bands and in other window regions. In addition, the causes of the continuum
remain a subject of controversy. This paper provides a brief historical overview
of the development of understanding of the continuum and then reviews recent
developments, with a focus on the near-infrared spectral region. Recent laboratory
measurements in near-infrared windows, which reveal absorption typically an order
of magnitude stronger than in widely used continuum models, are shown to have
important consequences for remote-sensing techniques that use these windows for
retrieving cloud properties.},

pages = {D20106},
abstract = {The relative contributions of atmospheric long‐wave absorbers to the
present‐day global greenhouse effect are among the most misquoted statistics in
public discussions of climate change. Much of the interest in these values is
however due to an implicit assumption that these contributions are directly
relevant for the question of climate sensitivity. Motivated by the need for a
clear reference for this issue, we review the existing literature and use the
Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE radiation module to provide an overview
of the role of each absorber at the present‐day and under doubled CO2. With a
straightforward scheme for allocating overlaps, we find that water vapor is the
dominant contributor (∼50% of the effect), followed by clouds (∼25%) and then
CO2 with ∼20%. All other absorbers play only minor roles. In a doubled CO2
scenario, this allocation is essentially unchanged, even though the magnitude
of the total greenhouse effect is significantly larger than the initial radiative
forcing, underscoring the importance of feedbacks from water vapor and clouds to
climate sensitivit},

   water portion of the spectra to determine in-cylinder gas temperature.
   The temperature results show that heat transfer effects can
   significantly bias thermometry when fiber-coupled engine probes are used.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {645},
Pages = {652-658},
Abstract = {Several recent papers have argued for warm, semidetached, molecular
   layers surrounding red giant and supergiant stars, a concept known as a
   MOLsphere. Spectroscopic and interferometric analyses have often
   corroborated this general picture. Here we present high-resolution
   spectroscopic data of pure rotational lines of water vapor at 12 mu m
   for the supergiant mu Cep. This star has often been used to test the
   concept of molecular layers around supergiants. Given the prediction of
   an isothermal, optically thick water vapor layer in local thermodynamic
   equilibrium around the star ( MOLsphere), we expected the 12 mu m lines
   to be in emission or at least in absorption but filled in by emission
   from the molecular layer around the star. Our data, however, show the
   contrary; we find definite absorption. Thus, our data do not easily fit
   into the suggested isothermal MOLsphere scenario. The 12 mu m lines,
   therefore, put new, strong constraints on the MOLsphere concept and on
   the nature of water seen in signatures across the spectra of early M
   supergiants. We also find that the absorption is even stronger than that
   calculated from a standard, spherically symmetric model photosphere
   without any surrounding layers. A cool model photosphere, representing
   cool outer layers, is, however, able to reproduce the lines, but this
   model does not account for water vapor emission at 6 mu m. Thus, a
   unified model for water vapor on mu Cep appears to be lacking. It does
   seem necessary to model the underlying photospheres of these supergiants
   in their whole complexity. The strong water vapor lines clearly reveal
   inadequacies of classical model atmospheres.},

abstract = {One of the more important questions in hydrology is: if the climate
warms in the future, will there be an intensification of the water cycle and, if
so, the nature of that intensification? There is considerable interest in this
question because an intensification of the water cycle may lead to changes in
water-resource availability, an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical
storms, floods, and droughts, and an amplification of warming through the water
vapor feedback. Empirical evidence for ongoing intensification of the water cycle
would provide additional support for the theoretical framework that links
intensification with warming. This paper briefly reviews the current state of
science regarding historical trends in hydrologic variables, including precipitation,
runoff, tropospheric water vapor, soil moisture, glacier mass balance, evaporation,
evapotranspiration, and growing season length. Data are often incomplete in spatial
and temporal domains and regional analyses are variable and sometimes contradictory;
however, the weight of evidence indicates an ongoing intensification of the water
cycle. In contrast to these trends, the empirical evidence to date does not consistently
support an increase in the frequency or intensity of tropical storms and floods.},

   identified below 30 000 cm(-1), corresponding to approximate to 85 000
   vibrational transitions. In principle there are many billions of
   allowed vibration-rotation transitions between these eigenstates. In
   our most complete test calculations we constructed a list of 3 billion
   (3 x 10(9)) lines. At room temperature, the computed monochromatic
   absorption coefficient is in good overall agreement with the HITRAN
   data base, while at higher temperatures its value exceeds the
   HITRAN-based absorption coefficient by more than an order of magnitude,
   due to the lack of high excitation lines in HITRAN. The agreement with
   the HITEMP version of HITRAN is considerably better than with the
   standard HITRAN. By comparing stellar model atmospheric structures and
   synthetic spectra based on our most extensive line list with results
   from calculations excluding the huge number of ultra-weak lines, we
   conclude that when the lines are well chosen, a few times 10 million
   lines are more than sufficient for all astrophysical purposes. We
   therefore offer to the community a line list of 100 million lines,
   easily accessible by anonymous ftp. Finally, we have compared results
   of synthetic stellar spectra based on this line list with observed ISO
   spectra and have found good agreement. In particular in the 2-4 mum
   region around the strong fundamental bands, the agreement with
   observations is considerably better than that obtained with other
   available water line lists.},

   molecules cm(-2) in our sample of K and M giant stars and the excitation
   temperatures are 1500 K or higher. Thus, the water bands are not
   originating in cool stellar winds either. The presence of water in the K
   and early M giant stars was quite unexpected from the traditional
   picture of the atmosphere of the red giant star consisting of the
   photosphere, hot chromosphere, and cool wind. We confirm that a rather
   warm molecule forming region should exist as a new component of the

been recorded on a Fourier transform spectrometer in the region 6200–9100 cm-1
with a resolution of 0·015 cm-1. In this region, we have performed a detailed
analysis of the 2v 2 + v 3, v 1 + v 3, v 1 + v 2 + v 3 - v 2 and v 1 + v 2 + v 3
bands. A primary motive for this study was to obtain higher rotational energy
levels for the (021), (101) and (111) vibrational states. Moreover an extensive
set of rotational levels of the (010) vibrational state has been deduced from the
combined study of hot bands involving the (011), (021) and (111) vibrational states.
A room-temperature absorption spectrum of water recorded on a Fourier transform
spectrometer in the region 1750–2300 cm-1 (resolution 0·005 cm-1) has also been
used to confirm the analysis.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-oxygen flame spectra have been recorded from 2850 cm-1 to 6200
cm-1 with a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer at a limit of resolution
of about 0·015 cm-1, and the emission spectrum of hot water vapour has been obtained.
The complete analysis of the v 1, v 3 and v 2 + v 3 bands has been performed. A
large set of new higher rotational energy levels for the (000), (100), (001) and (011)

the least squares method for deriving the energy levels from the observed transitions
is detailed.},

abstract = {The relationship of the anharmonic force constants in curvilinear internal
coordinates to the observed vibration-rotation spectrum of a molecule is reviewed.
A simplified method of setting up the required non-linear coordinate transformations
is described: this makes use of an L tensor, which is a straightforward generalization
of the L matrix used in the customary description of harmonic force constant calculations.
General formulae for the L tensor elements, in terms of the familiar L matrix elements,
are presented. The use of non-linear symmetry coordinates and redundancies are described.
Sample calculations on the water and ammonia molecules are reported.},
