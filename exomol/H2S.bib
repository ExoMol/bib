Title = {Nuclear spin symmetry breaking and spin polarization in rotational
   energy level clusters},
Journal =PRR,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {We present the first quantum mechanical study of hyperfine effects in
   the rotational cluster states of a symmetric triatomic molecule H2S.
   Rotational clusters arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by
   high-angular-momentum rotational motions in certain rigid molecules,
   resulting in dynamic enantiomorphism driven by kinetic distortion
   effects. Hyperfine interactions in the cluster states lead to
   collision-free breaking of nuclear spin symmetry, with the magnitude of
   nuclear spin ortho-para mixing significantly exceeding that in other
   states with same or lower angular momentum. The ortho-para mixing
   induces nuclear spin polarization in the laboratory frame and gives rise
   to two sets of enantiomers, which have different energies and oppositely
   oriented nuclear spin projections. Although hyperfine interactions
   preserve parity, they lift the degeneracy of opposite-parity cluster
   states. This phenomenon, previously observed experimentally, is
   explained as a result of tunneling between rotating enantiomers,
   facilitated by the Pauli exclusion principle.},

    abstract = "{Despite their chemical simplicity, the spectroscopic investigation of light hydrides, such as hydrogen sulfide, is challenging due to strong hyperfine interactions and/or anomalous centrifugal-distortion effects. Several hydrides have already been detected in the interstellar medium, and the list includes H2S and some of its isotopologues. Astronomical observation of isotopic species and, in particular, those bearing deuterium is important to gain insights into the evolutionary stage of astronomical objects and to shed light on interstellar chemistry. These observations require a very accurate knowledge of the rotational spectrum, which is so far limited for mono-deuterated hydrogen sulfide, HDS. To fill this gap, high-level quantum-chemical calculations and sub-Doppler measurements have been combined for the investigation of the hyperfine structure of the rotational spectrum in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave region. In addition to the determination of accurate hyperfine parameters, these new measurements together with the available literature data allowed us to extend the centrifugal analysis using a Watson-type Hamiltonian and a Hamiltonian-independent approach based on the Measured Active Ro-Vibrational Energy Levels (MARVEL) procedure. The present study thus permits to model the rotational spectrum of HDS from the microwave to far-infrared region with great accuracy, thereby accounting for the effect of the electric and magnetic interactions due to the deuterium and hydrogen nuclei.}",

   6320-6350 cm(-1) band}},
Journal = {Acta Physica Sinica},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Abstract = {As a highly corrosive and highly toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an
   important intermediate product orpollutant in many fields such as
   chemical industry, energy and environment. Accurate online measurement
   of itsconcentration is of great significance for process control and
   production safety. Tunable diode laser absorptionspectroscopy (TDLAS),
   as a quantitative absorption spectroscopy technique, is suitable for
   high-precision on-line measurement of H2S concentration in atmospheric
   environmental monitoring and industrial processescontrol. Considering
   that most of the spectroscopic parameters of H2S in the HITRAN2020
   database are mainlycalculated based on semi-empirical theoretical model
   and the experimental data to support them are lacking. Inthis work,
   direct absorption spectroscopy (DAS) method is firstly used to measure
   the absorption spectra of H2Sin the band of 6320-6350 cm-1. Six groups
   of characteristic lines with strong absorption and relative
   independenceare selected as the target transitions for experimental
   measurement. Then, the wavelength modulation-directabsorption (WM-DAS)
   method with no calibration and high signal-to-noise ratio is used to
   measure theabsorbances of the six groups of transitions under different
   pressures. Voigt, Raution and quadratic speed-dependent Voigt profiles
   fit the measured absorbances by least squares method in order to obtain
   thespectroscopic parameters such as the collision broadening
   coefficient, line strength and Dicke narrowingcoefficient. And the
   minimum standard deviation of residual error of absorbances is 7x10-5.
   The measurementuncertainty of each line strength is less than 2\%, and
   the uncertainty of collision broadening coefficients, Dickenarrowing
   coefficients and the speed-dependent coefficients are all less than
   10\%. This work is helpful inimproving the H2S spectral database and
   providing the spectral data basis for the high-precision measurementof

   abstract = {Context. The high cosmic abundance, the intermediate volatility, 
   and the chemical properties of sulphur allow sulphur-bearing species to be 
   used as tracers of the chemical processes in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter 
   exoplanets. Nevertheless, despite their properties and relevance as tracers 
   of the giant planets’ formation histories, little attention has been paid to 
   these species in the context of hot Jupiter atmospheres. 
   Aims. In this paper, we provide an overview of the abundances of sulphur-bearing
   species in hot Jupiter atmospheres under different conditions and explore their 
   observability.
   Methods. We used the photochemical kinetics code VULCAN to model hot Jupiter
   atmospheric disequilibrium chemistry. Transmission spectra for these atmospheres 
   were created using the modelling framework ARCiS. We varied model parameters 
   such as the diffusion coefficient Kzz, and we studied the importance of 
   photochemistry on the resulting mixing ratios. Furthermore, we varied the 
   chemical composition of the atmosphere by increasing the metallicity from solar 
   to ten times solar. We also explored different C/O ratios.
   Results. We find that H2S and SO2 are the best candidates for detection between 
   1 and 10 μm, using a spectral resolution that is representative of the 
   instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). H2S is easiest to 
   detect at an equilibrium temperature of ~1500 K, and with C/O ratios between 
   0.7 and 0.9, with the ideal value increasing slightly for increasing metallicity. 
   SO2 is most likely to be detected at an equilibrium temperature of ~1000 K at 
   low C/O ratios and high metallicities. Nevertheless, among these two molecules, 
   we expect SO2 detection to be more common, as it is detectable in scenarios more 
   favoured by formation models.
   Conclusions. We conclude that H2S and SO2 will most likely be detected in the 
   coming years with the JWST, and that the detection of these species will provide 
   information on atmospheric processes and planet formation scenarios.}

   We use this benchmark observation to test the reliability of molecular
   line lists used up-to-date atmospheric models. We determine which
   spectroscopic regions should be used to estimate the parameters of cold
   brown dwarfs and, by extension, exoplanets. We present a detailed
   spectroscopic atlas with molecular identifications across the H and K
   bands of the near-infrared. We find that water (H2O) line lists are
   overall reliable. We find the most discrepancies amongst older methane
   (CH4) line lists, and that the most up-to-date CH4 line lists correct
   many of these issues. We identify individual ammonia (NH3) lines, a
   hydrogen sulfide (H2S) feature at 1.5900 mu m, and a molecular hydrogen
   (H-2) feature at 2.1218 mu m. These are the first unambiguous detections
   of H2S and H-2 absorption features in an extra-solar atmosphere. With
   the H-2 detection, we place an upper limit on the atmospheric dust
   concentration of this T6 dwarf: at least 500 times less than the
   interstellar value, implying that the atmosphere is effectively
   dust-free. We additionally identify several features that do not appear
   in the model spectra. Our assessment of the line lists is valuable for
   atmospheric model applications to high-dispersion, low-S/N,
   high-background spectra, such as an exoplanet around a star. We
   demonstrate a significant enhancement in the detection of the CH4
   absorption signal in this T6 dwarf with the most up-to-date line lists.},

Abstract = {The Rayleigh - Schrodinger perturbation series possesses the property
   that can be termed multiple convergence. This property is that using
   appropriate multivalued approximants it enables the energy levels of
   several states to be calculated from the coefficient of a series

   previously demonstrated in a number of papers: for linear anharmonic
   oscillators (Sergeev and Goodson J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 31 4301 (1998)),
   for one-dimensional periodic problem (Fernandez and Diaz 2001, Eur.

Abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide radicals in the ground state, SH(X), and hydrogen
   disulfide molecules, H2S, are both detected in the interstellar medium,
   but the returned SH(X)/H2S abundance ratios imply a depletion of the
   former relative to that predicted by current models (which assume that
   photon absorption by H2S at energies below the ionization limit results
   in H + SH photoproducts). Here we report that translational spectroscopy
   measurements of the H atoms and S(D-1) atoms formed by photolysis of
   jet-cooled H2S molecules at many wavelengths in the range 122 <= lambda
   <= 155 nm offer a rationale for this apparent depletion; the quantum
   yield for forming SH(X) products, Gamma, decreases from unity (at the
   longest excitation wavelengths) to zero at short wavelengths.
   Convoluting the wavelength dependences of Gamma, the H2S parent
   absorption and the interstellar radiation field implies that only
   similar to 26\% of photoexcitation events result in SH(X) products. The
   findings suggest a need to revise the relevant astrochemical models.},

Abstract = {Recent analysis of Gemini-North/NIFS H-band (1.45-1.8 mu m) observations
   of Uranus, recorded in 2010, with recently updated line data has
   revealed the spectral signature of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in Uranus's
   atmosphere (Irwin et al., 2018). Here, we extend this analysis to
   Gemini-North/NIFS observations of Neptune recorded in 2009 and find a
   similar detection of H2S spectral absorption features in the 1.57-1.58
   mu m range, albeit slightly less evident, and retrieve a mole fraction
   of similar to 1 - 3 ppm at the cloud tops. We find a much clearer
   detection (and much higher retrieved column abundance above the clouds)
   at southern polar latitudes compared with equatorial latitudes, which
   suggests a higher relative humidity of H2S here. We find our retrieved
   H2S abundances are most consistent with atmospheric models that have
   reduced methane abundance near Neptune's south pole, consistent with
   HST/STIS determinations (Karkoschka and Tomasko, 2011). We also
   conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the Neptune and Uranus
   data and found that in the 1.57-1.60 mu m range, some of the Empirical
   Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) mapped closely to physically significant
   quantities, with one being strongly correlated with the modelled H2S
   signal and clearly mapping the spatial dependence of its spectral
   detectability. Just as for Uranus, the detection of H2S at the cloud
   tops constrains the deep bulk sulphur/nitrogen abundance to exceed unity
   (i.e. > 4.4 - 5.0 times the solar value) in Neptune's bulk atmosphere,
   provided that ammonia is not sequestered at great depths, and places a
   lower limit on its mole fraction below the observed cloud of (0.4-1.3) x
   10(-5). The detection of gaseous H2S at these pressure levels adds to
   the weight of evidence that the principal constituent of the 2.5-3.5 bar
   cloud is likely to be H2S ice.},

Title = {{Detection of hydrogen sulfide above the clouds in Uranus's atmosphere}},
Journal = {Nat. Astron.},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {420-427},
Abstract = {Visible-to-near-infrared observations indicate that the cloud top of the
   main cloud deck on Uranus lies at a pressure level of between 1.2 bar
   and 3 bar. However, its composition has never been unambiguously
   identified, although it is widely assumed to be composed primarily of
   either ammonia or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) ice. Here, we present evidence
   of a clear detection of gaseous H2S above this cloud deck in the
   wavelength region 1.57-1.59 mu m with a mole fraction of 0.4-0.8 ppm at
   the cloud top. Its detection constrains the deep bulk sulfur/nitrogen
   abundance to exceed unity (> 4.4-5.0 times the solar value) in Uranus's
   bulk atmosphere, and places a lower limit on the mole fraction of H2S
   below the observed cloud of (1.0-2.5) x 10(-5). The detection of gaseous
   H2S at these pressure levels adds to the weight of evidence that the
   principal constituent of 1.2-3-bar cloud is likely to be H2S ice.},

journal = AA,
year = {2017},
volume = {606},
pages = {A124/1-14},
abstract = {Context. Sulphur is a relatively abundant element in the local Galaxy
that is known to form a variety of molecules in the circumstellar envelopes of AGB
stars. The abundances of these molecules vary based on the chemical types and
mass-loss rates of AGB stars.Aims. Through a survey of (sub-)millimetre emission
lines of various sulphur-bearing molecules, we aim to determine which molecules
are the primary carriers of sulphur in different types of AGB stars. In this paper,
the first in a series, we investigate the occurrence of H2S in AGB circumstellar
envelopes and determine its abundance, where possible. Methods. We surveyed 20
AGB stars with a range of mass-loss rates and different chemical types using the
Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope to search for rotational transition
lines of five key sulphur-bearing molecules: CS, SiS, SO, SO2, and H2S. Here we
present our results for H2S, including detections, non-detections, and detailed
radiative transfer modelling of the detected lines. We compared results based on
various descriptions of the molecular excitation of H2S and different abundance
distributions, including Gaussian abundances, where possible, and two different
abundance distributions derived from chemical modelling results. Results. We detected
H2S towards five AGB stars, all of which have high mass-loss rates of á¹€ â‰¥ 5 Ã— 10-6
MâŠ™ yr-1 and are oxygen rich. H2S was not detected towards the carbon or S-type stars
that fall in a similar mass-loss range. For the stars in our sample with detections,
we find peak o-H2S abundances relative to H2 between 4 Ã— 10-7 and 2.5 Ã— 10-5.
Conclusions. Overall, we conclude that H2S can play a significant role in oxygen-rich
AGB stars with higher mass-loss rates, but is unlikely to play a key role in stars
of other chemical types or in lower mass-loss rate oxygen-rich stars. For two sources,
V1300 Aql and GX Mon, H2S is most likely the dominant sulphur-bearing molecule
in the circumstellar envelope.},

abstract = { Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a biologically relevant signaling molecule
in mammals. Along with the volatile substances nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide
(CO), H2S is defined as a gasotransmitter. It plays a physiological role in a
variety of functions, including synaptic transmission, vascular tone, angiogenesis,
inflammation, and cellular signaling. The generation of H2S is catalyzed by cystathionine
Î²-synthase (CBS), cystathionine Î³-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase
(3-MST). The expression of CBS and CSE is tissue specific, with CBS being expressed
predominantly in the brain, and CSE in peripheral tissues, including lungs. CSE
expression and activity are developmentally regulated, and recent studies suggest
that CSE plays an important role in lung alveolarization during fetal development.
In the respiratory tract, endogenous H2S has been shown to participate in the
regulation of important functions such as airway tone, pulmonary circulation,
cell proliferation or apoptosis, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation.
In the past few years, changes in the generation of H2S have been linked to the
pathogenesis of a variety of acute and chronic inflammatory lung diseases, including
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recently, our laboratory made
the critical discovery that cellular H2S exerts broad-spectrum antiviral activity
both in vitro and in vivo, in addition to independent antiinflammatory activity.
These findings have important implications for the development of novel therapeutic
strategies for viral respiratory infections, as well as other inflammatory lung
diseases, especially in light of recent significant efforts to generate controlled-release
H2S donors for clinical therapeutic applications. },

Journal = {Analyst},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {139},
Pages = {198-203},
Abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide is a highly corrosive, harmful, and toxic gas produced
   under anaerobic conditions within industrial processes or in natural
   environments, and plays an important role in the sulfur cycle. According
   to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the
   permissible exposure limit (during 8 hours) is 10 ppm. Concentrations of
   20 ppm are the threshold for critical health issues. In workplace
   environments with human subjects frequently exposed to H$_2$S, e. g.,
   during petroleum extraction and refining, real-time monitoring of
   exposure levels is mandatory. Sensors based on electrochemical
   measurement principles, semiconducting metal-oxides, taking advantage of
   their optical properties, have been described for H$_2$S monitoring.
   However, extended response times, limited selectivity, and bulkiness of
   the instrumentation are common disadvantages of the sensing techniques
   reported to date. Here, we describe for the first time usage of a new
   generation of compact gas cells, i.e., so-called substrate-integrated
   hollow waveguides (iHWGs), combined with a compact Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for advanced gas sensing of H$_2$S. The
   principle of detection is based on the immediate UV-assisted conversion
   of the rather weak IR-absorber H$_2$S into much more pronounced and
   distinctively responding SO2. A calibration was established in the range
   of 10-100 ppm with a limit of detection (LOD) at 3 ppm, which is
   suitable for occupational health monitoring purposes. The developed
   sensing scheme provides an analytical response time of less than 60
   seconds. Considering the substantial potential for miniaturization using
   e. g., a dedicated quantum cascade laser (QCL) in lieu of the FTIR
   spectrometer, the developed sensing approach may be evolved into a
   hand-held instrument, which may be tailored to a variety of applications
   ranging from environmental monitoring to workplace safety surveillance,
   process analysis and clinical diagnostics, e. g., breath analysis.},

   tracking and an easy-to-use method enabling in situ monitoring
   calibration. A diode laser emitting around 1.57 mu m served as the

Abstract = {Volcanic eruptions inject sulfur into the atmosphere mainly in form of
   SO2 and H$_2$S. The ratio of these species (H2S/SO2), which is usually used
   as the mirror of the oxidation state of the source magma, varies
   significantly according to the type of activity, tectonic setting etc.
   This study aims to investigate the role of the hot core of plinian and
   sub-plinian volcanic plumes (T > 600 degrees C) in sulfur speciation
   based on the thermodynamic equilibrium in this temperature range. We
   consider the hot core as a box model in which 1000 degrees C magmatic
   gas and 25 degrees C ambient air are mixed and show that it functions as
   a hot oxidizing reactor for S species. Processes inside the hot core
   usually decrease the H$_2$S content of the system but can either increase
   or decrease SO2 depending on initial oxidation state. Thus the SO2
   injected into the atmosphere is not essentially generated directly from
   the magma but it can be produced in the hot core as the result of H$_2$S
   oxidation. Besides, volcanic cloud compositions do not mirror the source
   conditions. Considering three types of tectonic settings (convergent
   plate, divergent plate and hot spot) we propose that H$_2$S emission is
   more likely under reduced conditions in divergent plate and hot spot
   volcanic settings.},

Title = {{Estimation of hydrogen sulfide emission rates at several wastewater
   treatment plants through experimental concentration measurements and
   dispersion modeling}},
Journal = {J. Air Waste Management Assoc.},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {758-766},
Abstract = {The management and operation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)
   usually involve the release into the atmosphere of malodorous substances
   with the potential to reduce the quality of life of people living
   nearby. In this type of facility, anaerobic degradation processes
   contribute to the generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), often at quite
   high concentrations; thus, the presence of this chemical compound in the
   atmosphere can be a good indicator of the occurrence and intensity of
   the olfactory impact in a specific area. The present paper describes the
   experimental and modelling work being carried out by CEAM-UMH in the
   surroundings of several wastewater treatment plants located in the
   Valencia Autonomous Community (Spain). This work has permitted the
   estimation of H$_2$S emission rates at different WWTPs under different
   environmental and operating conditions. Our methodological approach for
   analyzing and describing the most relevant aspects of the olfactory
   impact consisted of several experimental campaigns involving intensive
   field measurements using passive samplers in the vicinity of several
   WWTPs, in combination with numerical simulation results from a
   diagnostic dispersion model. A meteorological tower at each WWTP
   provided the input values for the dispersion code, ensuring a good fit
   of the advective component and therefore more confidence in the modelled
   concentration field in response to environmental conditions. Then,
   comparisons between simulated and experimental H$_2$S concentrations
   yielded estimates of the global emission rate for this substance at
   several WWTPs at different time periods. The results obtained show a
   certain degree of temporal and spatial (between-plant) variability
   (possibly due to both operational and environmental conditions).
   Nevertheless, and more importantly, the results show a high degree of
   uniformity in the estimates, which consistently stay within the same
   order of magnitude.
   Implications: Estimating emissions to the atmosphere is usually
   considered a complex task, especially when such discharge comes from
   diffuse or uncontrolled sources. In any approach to air quality control,
   just from the point of view of increasing knowledge or as a management
   problem in order to reduce present levels of pollution, accurate
   estimation of emission rates is revealed as a fundamental step.
   Evaluation from an indirect method provides a useful methodology in such
   cases. Combination of dispersion modeling with experimental air
   concentration measurements permits one to obtain a first estimation of
   H$_2$S emission rates at several wastewater treatment plants. In a
   subsequent refinement of the process, the initial constant average
   emissions calculated were improved, leading to the formulation of a
   time-varying emission model, as a function of environmental quantities.},

   molecular species are identified. In addition, three hydrogen
   recombination lines are detected. The species NO, H$_2$S, H2CS, NH2CN, and
   CH3CN are detected for the first time in this galaxy. Assuming local
   thermodynamic equilibrium, we determine the column densities of all the
   detected molecules. We also calculate upper limits to the column
   densities of fourteen other important, but undetected, molecules, such
   as SiO, HNCO, or OCS. We compare the chemical composition of the two
   starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC 253. This comparison enables us to
   establish the chemical differences between the products of the strong
   photon-dominated regions driving the heating in M 82, and the
   large-scale shocks that influence the properties of the molecular clouds
   in the nucleus of NGC 253.
   Conclusions. Overall, both sources have different chemical compositions.
   Some key molecules highlight the different physical processes dominating
   both central regions. Examples include CH3CCH, c-C3H2, or CO+, the
   abundances of which are clearly higher in M 82 than in NGC 253, pointing
   at photodissociating regions. On the other hand, species such as CH2NH,
   NS, SiO, and HOCO+ have abundances of up to one order of magnitude
   higher in NGC 253 than in M 82.},

Observations, calibration, and analysis of the line kinematics}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {532},
pages = {A23},
Abstract = {Context. Unbiased spectral surveys are powerful tools to study the
chemistry and the physics of star forming regions, because they can provide a
complete census of the molecular content and the observed lines probe the physical
structure of the source. Aims. While unbiased surveys at the millimeter and
sub-millimeter wavelengths observable from ground-based telescopes have previously
been performed towards several high mass protostars, very little exists on low
mass protostars, which are believed to resemble our own Sun's progenitor. To
help fill up this gap in our understanding, we carried out a complete spectral
survey of the bands at 3, 2, 1, and 0.9 mm towards the solar type protostar
IRAS 16293-2422. Methods. The observations covered a range of about 200 GHz and
were obtained with the IRAM-30 m and JCMT-15 m telescopes during about 300 h of
observations. Particular attention was devoted to the inter-calibration of the
acquired spectra with previous observations. All the lines detected with more
than 3 sigma confidence-interval certainty and free from obvious blending effects
were fitted with Gaussians to estimate their basic kinematic properties. Results.
More than 4000 lines were detected (with sigma >= 3) and identified, yielding a
line density of approximatively 20 lines per GHz, comparable to previous surveys
in massive hot cores. The vast majority (about two-thirds) of the lines are weak
and produced by complex organic molecules. The analysis of the profiles of more
than 1000 lines belonging to 70 species firmly establishes the presence of two
distinct velocity components associated with the two objects, A and B, forming
the IRAS 16293-2422 binary system. In the source A, the line widths of several
species increase with the upper level energy of the transition, a behavior
compatible with gas infalling towards a similar to 1 M-circle dot object. The
source B, which does not show this effect, might have a much lower central mass
of similar to 0.1 M-circle dot. The difference in the rest velocities of both
objects is consistent with the hypothesis that the source B rotates around the
source A. Conclusions. This spectral survey, although obtained with single-dish
telescopes at a low spatial resolution, allows us to separate the emission from
two different components, thanks to the large number of lines detected. The data
of the survey are public and can be retrieved on the TIMASSS web site },

Title = {{Atmospheric sulfur photochemistry on hot jupiters}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {701},
Pages = {L20-L24},
Abstract = {We develop a new one-dimensional photochemical kinetics code to address
stratospheric chemistry and stratospheric heating in hot Jupiters. Here we address
optically active S-containing species and CO(2) at 1200 <= T <= 2000 K. HS (mercapto)
and S(2) are highly reactive species that are generated photochemically and thermochemically
from H(2)S with peak abundances between 1 and 10 mbar. S(2) absorbs UV between 240
and 340 nm and is optically thick for metallicities {[}S/H] > 0 at T >= 1200 K.
HS is probably more important than S2, as it is generally more abundant than S2
under hot Jupiter conditions and it absorbs at somewhat redder wavelengths. We
use molecular theory to compute an HS absorption spectrum from sparse available
data and find that HS should absorb strongly between 300 and 460 nm, with absorption
at the longer wavelengths being temperature sensitive. When the two absorbers are
combined, radiative heating ( per kg of gas) peaks at 100 mu bars, with a total
stratospheric heating of similar to 8 x 10(4) W m(-2) for a jovian planet orbiting
a solar-twin at 0.032 AU. Total heating is insensitive to metallicity. The CO(2)
mixing ratio is a well behaved quadratic function of metallicity, ranging from 1.6 x 10(-8) to 1.6 x 10(-4)
for -0.3 < {[}M/H] < 1.7. CO(2) is insensitive to insolation, vertical mixing,
temperature (1200 < T < 2000), and gravity. The photochemical calculations confirm
that CO(2) should prove a useful probe of planetary metallicity.},

Abstract = {We report observations of the expected main S-bearing species (SO, SO2
   and H$_2$S) in the low-mass star forming region L1689N. We obtained large
   scale (similar to300{''} x 200{''}) maps of several transitions from
   these molecules with the goal to study the sulphur chemistry, i.e. how
   the relative abundances change in the different physical conditions
   found in L1689N. We identified eight interesting regions, where we
   carried out a quantitative comparative study: the molecular cloud ( as
   reference position), five shocked regions caused by the interaction of
   the molecular outflows with the cloud, and the two protostars IRAS
   16293-2422 and 16293E. In the cloud we carefully computed the gas
   temperature and density by means of a non-LTE LVG code, while in other
   regions we used previous results. We hence derived the column density of
   SO, SO2 and H$_2$S, together with SiO and H2CO - which were observed
   previously - and their relevant abundance ratios. We find that SiO is
   the molecule that shows the largest abundance variations in the shocked
   regions, whereas S-bearing molecules show more moderate variations.
   Remarkably, the region of the brightest SiO emission in L1689N is
   undetected in SO2, H$_2$S and H2CO and only marginally detected in SO. In
   the other weaker SiO shocks, SO2 is enhanced with respect to SO. We
   propose a schema in which the different molecular ratios correspond to
   different ages of the shocks. Finally, we find that SO, SO2 and H$_2$S have
   significant abundance jumps in the inner hot core of IRAS 16293-2422 and
   discuss the implications of the measured abundances.},

abstract = {The absorption spectrum ofH2S (1159 lines) has been recorded between 10 780
and 11 330 cmÂ¡1 by intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS). As a result
of the increase of sensitivity of ICLAS over previous Fourier transform investigations
in the same spectral region, the number of experimental energy levels of the (40C, 1)
and (40Â¡, 1) local mode states ((212) and (311) in normal mode notation) has been
triplicated for the main isotopic species H$_2$$^{32}$S (198 compared to 62).
Moreover, 112 energy levels of H234S and 25 energy levels of H233S, present in
natural abundance in the sample, could also be determined. Three rotational levels
of the (30Â§, 3) local mode pair of dark states ((132) and (231) in normal mode
notation) of H32S could also be observed through extra lines borrowing their
intensities via resonance interactions with line-partners of the dominant bands.
The (40C, 1) and (40Â¡, 1) local mode states form a degenerate local mode pair,
with the same rotational structure for the two components. The observed energy
levels were reproduced by an effective Hamiltonian including the (40Â§, 1) and (30Â§, 3)
interacting local mode pairs. This Hamiltonianwas applied either in the C2v or
Cs symmetry groups leading to an rms deviation of 0.0058 and 0.0068 cmÂ¡1 respectively,
comparable to the experimental accuracy (0.0028 cmÂ¡1). The degeneracy of the rotational
structure of the (40Â§, 1) pair is unaffected by the interaction with the nearby (30Â§, 3)
local mode states. On the contrary, an additional interaction with dark states
lifts in some cases this degeneracy. The same effective Hamiltonian with scaled
parameters was successfully used to reproduce the energy levels of the H233S and
H234S isotopic species. Finally, the extremely weak 3Âº1 C 3Âº2 band of H$_2$$^{32}$S
at 11 097.161 cmÂ¡1 could also be detected leading to the determination of 70 levels
of the corresponding (21C, 3) upper state ((330) in normal mode notation). The
integrated intensities have been estimated for the bands corresponding to the
(40C, 1) and (40Â¡, 1) upper states. A total of six transformed dipole moment
parameters were derived from the measured line intensities allowing to simulate
very satisfactorily the observed spectrum. The transition moment relative to
the (40Â¡, 1) upper state is found about twice as large as the one relative to
the (40C, 1) state.},

Watson Hamiltonian to determine precise sets of rotational constants through J10
and up to nine Fermi and Coriolis coupling parameters. Intensities of the two
H$_2$$^{32}$S triads were modeled with rms values of 2.5\%, using the transformed
transition moment expansion with 19 terms for 568 intensities of the first triad
and 11 terms for the 526 intensities of the second triad. The second derivatives
of the dipole moment with respect to normal coordinates were estimated in Debye
to be: 22mx Â 00.004873 (90) ; 12mx Â 0.01372 (30); and 23mz Â 0.01578 (30).
This confirmed that for hydrogen sulfide some of the second derivatives are larger
than the first derivatives. The calculated line intensities were summed yielding
integrated band strengths (in cm02 /atm at 296 K) as follows: 0.3315 for 2n2 , 0.4522

abstract ={The overtone spectrum of H$_2$S has been recorded by intracavity laser

the rotational levels of the states (606, 0) on the one hand, and the rotational

levels of the two pairs of states interact strongly through anharmonic and Coriolis-type
resonances. These resonances transfer intensity to lines involving the (501, 2)

and reproduced satisfactorily using an Hamiltonian matrix that takes explicitly
into account the various interactions and assumes the same vibrational energy and
rotational constants for the two components of the local mode pairs. The following
band centers have been obtained: n0 (601, 0)514291.122 cm21 and n0 (506, 2)514284.705 cm21.

Abstract = {Using the IRAM 30m telescope, we have carried out a systematic survey of
   the millimeter line emission of SO2 and H$_2$S in various categories of
   0-rich circumstellar envelopes. The main sample contains 14 OH/IR stars
   of three classes: IRC objects with intermediate mass-loss rates, very
   cold OH/IR stars, and OH supergiants. Three lines of SO2 and two lines
   of H$_2$S were observed. Both molecules were detected in all the stars,
   with multiline detections in most of them. The J = 5 - 4 line of SiO,
   present in one of the observed frequency bands, was also detected in all
   objects. In addition, SO2 was detected in two SRb stars, and H$_2$S in the
   carbon star IRC+10216. Upper limits were obtained for the emission from
   15 other stars, both O- and C-rich. The 86 GHz line of SO was also
   detected in 5 stars.
   The lines of SO2 are found to be optically thin with a relatively low
   rotational excitation temperature (25 - 40 K), in good agreement with
   the chemical models predicting its photosynthesis in the outer layers of
   the envelope. The derived maximum abundances (approximately a few 10(-6)
   by number) also agree reasonably well with these models.
   The apparent rotational temperature of H$_2$S is inferred to be somewhat
   larger (approximately 50 - 100 K) and its line profiles appear somewhat
   narrower, suggesting a location of H$_2$S in inner layers of the envelope
   which have possibly not yet been fully accelerated. Models we have made
   for the infrared rotational excitation show that it is possible to
   account for the observational results with H$_2$S confined to the inner
   envelope with a relatively large abundance (approximately 10(-5)) and a
   cutoff radius of less than or similar to 10(16) cm. However, it is
   difficult to give a satisfactory chemical account of Such a Cutoff
   radius. It implies either a very low abundance of H
   (less-than-or-similar to 10(-5)), or a synthesis of H$_2$S on grains. The
   destruction of' H$_2$S much closer to the star than the destruction radius
   or H2O is also difficult to explain by photodissociation or grain
   processes.
   The overall abundance of sulfur in the gas phase of 0-rich circumstellar
   envelopes is certainty relatively large, probably at least approximately
   50\% of the solar abundance.
   A few outstanding stars are discussed in terms of their peculiarities:
   the line profiles of the bipolar nebula OH 231.8+4.2 are examined in
   terms of the pronounced bipolar structure and unusually high velocities
   within the flow, and the H$_2$S profiles in the Supergiant NML Cygni are
   possibly affected by the strong and anisotropic external radiation
   field.},

abstract = {The high resolution rovibrational spectrum of H$_2$S has been evaluated
from three-dimensional ab initio potential energy and electric dipole moment functions
and variational rovibrational eigenfunctions, which took full account of anharmonicity
effects and rotation-vibration coupling. The quality of the near equilibrium theoretical
potential energy function has been checked by comparisons with experimental equilibrium
structure, empirical quartic force fields, vibrational band origins, centrifugal
distortion constants, and rotational energy levels. All parameters agree well with
the available experimental data. Vibrational band intensities for the V 2, 2v2, VI'
and V3 bands have been calculated from empirical and ab initio dipole moment
functions and compared with experimental and theoretical integrated band intensities.
The difficulties arising by the derivation of such data from the experimental
intensities of H$_2$S are discussed. The theoretical results strongly suggest that
higher than first derivatives are needed for a proper description of the dipole
moment function. The room temperature absorption spectra have been evaluated ab
initio for the pure rotational and the V2' 2v2, VI' and V3 transitions. The unusual
intensity pattern of the P, Q, and R branches attributed to the rotational-vibrational
coupling has been well reproduced. Absolute line intensities calculated previously
by perturbation theory are compared with variational results. The purely theoretical
line intensities agree satisfactorily with experiment for the bending transitions,
however, the extremely flat regions of the dipole moment functions along the bond
stretching displacements make the transition intensities very sensitive to the
values of the dipole moment derivatives.},

abstract = {The fundamental infrared vibration bands of hydrogen sulfide exhibit
an interesting intensity anomaly characterized by P branches which are much weaker
than the corresponding R branches. This work shows that this anomaly is caused
by centrifugal distortion of the nonrigid molecule. A formalism based on a semiclassical
approach is used to calculate the vibration-rotational line positions and their
intensities. The computed theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental
spectra. This formalism also gives a method of determining the relative sign of \ O/L/ oQ)
with respect to /Lo. The values of (O/L/ oQ) needed in the calculations were obtained
from the experimental integrated band intensities and were found to be (O/L/OQI)
= -4.4 esu g-l and (O/L/OQ2) = +8.7 esu g-l.},

abstract = {Pure rotational transitions of H$_2$S'~, H$_2$S, and H$_2$S have been
measured with high precision in the region of one to two millimeters. From these
measurements the SH bond length is found to be 1.3226A and the bond angle to be
92' 6'. The S"nuclear quadrupole coupling observed along the principal inertial
axes are egg, =â€”32 Mc/sec, egqsp= â€”8 Mc/sec, and eggâ€ž=+40Mc/sec. Approximate
analysis of the quadrupole coupling constants shows that the bonding orbitals of S
are spd hybrids and yields a value of â€”0.06X10 ' cm' for the quadrupole moment
of the S"nucleus. From the known ratio Q"/Q" this gives Q"=0.04X10 ' cm'". Zeeman
studies show that the molecular gs factor is approximately, but not exactly, equal
for diBerent rotational states. A mean value of 0.24 nuclear magneton is found for gz.},
