Title = {{THE INFLUENCE OF THE EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION ON
   THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OF EXOPLANETS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{818}},
Abstract = {{By varying the profiles of stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral
   energy distributions (SEDs), we tested the influences of stellar EUV
   SEDs on the physical and chemical properties of an escaping atmosphere.
   We apply our model to study four exoplanets: HD 189733b, HD 209458b, GJ
   436b, and Kepler-11b. We find that the total mass loss rates of an
   exoplanet, which are determined mainly by the integrated fluxes, are
   moderately affected by the profiles of the EUV SED, but the composition
   and species distributions in the atmosphere can be dramatically modified
   by the different profiles of the EUV SED. For exoplanets with a high
   hydrodynamic escape parameter (.), the amount of atomic hydrogen
   produced by photoionization at different altitudes can vary by one to
   two orders of magnitude with the variation of stellar EUV SEDs. The
   effect of photoionization of H is prominent when the EUV SED is
   dominated by the low-energy spectral region (400-900 angstrom), which
   pushes the transition of H/H+ to low altitudes. In contrast, the
   transition of H/H+ moves to higher altitudes when most photons are
   concentrated in the high-energy spectral region (50-400 angstrom). For
   exoplanets with a low., the lower temperatures of the atmosphere make
   many chemical reactions so important that photoionization alone can no
   longer determine the composition of the escaping atmosphere. For HD
   189733b, it is possible to explain the time variability of Ly alpha
   between 2010 and 2011 by a change in the EUV SED of the host K-type
   star, yet invoking only thermal H I in the atmosphere.}},

Title = {ATMOSPHERE EXPANSION AND MASS LOSS OF CLOSE-ORBIT GIANT EXOPLANETS
   HEATED BY STELLAR XUV. II. EFFECTS OF PLANETARY MAGNETIC FIELD;
   STRUCTURING OF INNER MAGNETOSPHERE},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {813},
Abstract = {This is the second paper in a series where we build a self-consistent
   model to simulate the mass-loss process of a close-orbit magnetized
   giant exoplanet, so-called hot Jupiter (HJ). In this paper we generalize
   the hydrodynamic (HD) model of an HJ's expanding hydrogen atmosphere,
   proposed in the first paper, to include the effects of intrinsic
   planetary magnetic field. The proposed self-consistent axisymmetric 2D
   magnetohydrodynamics model incorporates radiative heating and ionization
   of the atmospheric gas, basic hydrogen chemistry for the appropriate
   account of major species composing HJ's upper atmosphere and related
   radiative energy deposition, and. H-3(+) and Ly alpha cooling processes.
   The model also takes into account a realistic solar-type X-ray/EUV
   spectrum for calculation of intensity and column density distribution of
   the radiative energy input, as well as gravitational and rotational
   forces acting in a tidally locked planet-star system. An interaction
   between the expanding atmospheric plasma and an intrinsic planetary
   magnetic dipole field leads to the formation of a current-carrying
   magnetodisk that plays an important role for topology and scaling of the
   planetary magnetosphere. A cyclic character of the magnetodisk behavior,
   composed of consequent phases of the disk formation followed by the
   magnetic reconnection with the ejection of a ring-type plasmoid, has
   been discovered and investigated. We found that the mass-loss rate of an
   HD 209458b analog planet is weakly affected by the equatorial surface
   field <0.3 G, but is suppressed by an order of magnitude at the field of
   1 G.},

Title = {Hot and diffuse clouds near the galactic center probed by metastable
   H-3(+)1,2,3},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {632},
Pages = {882-893},
Abstract = {Using an absorption line from the metastable (J; K) ( 3; 3) level of
   H-3(+) together with other lines of H-3(+) and CO observed along several
   sight lines, we have discovered a vast amount of high-temperature (T
   similar to 250 K) and low-density (n similar to 100 cm(-3)) gas with a
   large velocity dispersion in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the
   Galaxy, i. e., within 200 pc of the center. Approximately three-fourths
   of the H-3(+) along the line of sight to the brightest source we
   observed, the Quintuplet object GCS 3-2, is inferred to be in the CMZ,
   with the remaining H-3(+) located in intervening spiral arms. About half
   of the H-3(+) in the CMZ has velocities near similar to -100 km s(-1),
   indicating that it is associated with the 180 pc radius expanding
   molecular ring, which approximately forms the outer boundary of the CMZ.
   The other half, with velocities of similar to -50 and similar to 0 km
   s(-1), is probably closer to the center. CO is not very abundant in
   these clouds. Hot and diffuse gas in which the (3, 3) level is populated
   was not detected toward several dense clouds and diffuse clouds in the
   Galactic disk where large column densities of colder H-3(+) have been
   reported previously. Thus, the newly discovered environment appears to
   be unique to the CMZ. The large observed H-3(+) column densities in the
   CMZ suggest an ionization rate much higher than in the diffuse
   interstellar medium in the Galactic disk. Our finding that the H-3(+) in
   the CMZ is almost entirely in diffuse clouds indicates that the reported
   volume filling factor (f >= 0.1) for n >= 10(4) cm(-3) clouds in the CMZ
   is an overestimate by at least an order of magnitude.},

The present review discusses how to unravel such spectra through the use of theoretical multichannel spectroscopy to extract the key dynamical implications. Moreover, this class of techniques permits a quantitative prediction or reproduction of experimental spectra for some of the more challenging atomic systems under investigation. It is shown that multichannel spectroscopy marries the techniques of multichannel quantum-defect theory to the eigenchannel R-matrix method (or related methods). It has long been appreciated that multichannel quantum-defect theory can successfully use a collision-theory framework to interpret enormously complicated Rydberg spectra. However, the capabilities of multichannel quantum-defect theory have increased dramatically during the past decade, through the development of nearly ab initio methods for the calculation of the short-range scattering parameters that control the interactions of closed and open channels. In this review, emphasis is given to the alkaline-earth atoms, for which many different observables have been successfully compared with experiment over broad ranges of energy and resolution. Applications of the method to describe the photoionization spectra of more complex open-shell atoms are also discussed."

	abstract = "The dissociative recombination of an H-3(+) ion after it is struck by a low-energy electron is important for understanding observations of H-3(+) in diffuse interstellar clouds. At the same time, it is the simplest triatomic ion and for this reason its theoretical description can serve as a prototype for other polyatomic ions. Meanwhile, experimental determinations of the recombination rate have varied widely, which has resulted in some controversy and confusion. Until recently, it seemed unlikely that this problem could be resolved by theoretical studies because the mechanism of H-3(+) dissociative recombination remained unclear. A recent study, however [Kokoouline , Nature (London) 412, 891 (2001)], provided evidence that the inclusion of the Jahn-Teller coupling can produce a dissociative recombination rate that overlaps the range of experimental observations. Here, we propose a theoretical description of the coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in a polyatomic molecule, which describes the competition between autoionization and predissociation of the Rydberg states formed after an incident electron is captured. The method treats the vibrational and rotational excitations of the ion, accounts for all symmetry restrictions imposed by the geometry of the molecule, including vibrational, rotational, and electronic and nuclear-spin symmetries. The framework combines the multichannel quantum-defect theory, the adiabatic hyperspherical approach, and the techniques of outgoing-wave Siegert pseudostates. The proposed method can be applied to studies of dissociative recombination of other triatomic ions, including all the degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. Our calculations of the cross section and the recombination rate confirm that the Jahn-Teller effect is responsible for the large rate in H-3(+). Theoretical results for dissociative recombination of H-3(+) are in agreement with storage-ring experiments."

Title = {INVESTIGATING THE COSMIC-RAY IONIZATION RATE IN THE GALACTIC DIFFUSE
   INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF H-3(+)},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {745},
Abstract = {Observations of H-3(+) in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium have
   led to various surprising results, including the conclusion that the
   cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta(2)) is about one order of magnitude
   larger than previously thought. The present survey expands the sample of
   diffuse cloud sight lines with H-3(+) observations to 50, with
   detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates inferred from these
   observations are in the range (1.7 +/- 1.3) x 10(-16) s(-1) < zeta(2) <
   (10.6 +/- 8.2) x 10(-16) s(-1) with a mean value of zeta(2) =
   (3.5(-3.0)(+5.3)) x 10(-16) s(-1). Upper limits (3 sigma) derived from
   non-detections of H-3(+) are as low as.2 < 0.4 x 10-16 s-1. These low
   upper limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray
   ionization rates, indicate variations in zeta(2) between different
   diffuse cloud sight lines. A study of zeta(2) versus N-H (total hydrogen
   column density) shows that the two parameters are not correlated for
   diffuse molecular cloud sight lines, but that the ionization rate
   decreases when NH increases to values typical of dense molecular clouds.
   Both the difference in ionization rates between diffuse and dense clouds
   and the variation of zeta(2) among diffuse cloud sight lines are likely
   the result of particle propagation effects. The lower ionization rate in
   dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy (few MeV) protons to
   penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in diffuse clouds is
   controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site of particle
   acceleration.},

   EIGHT INFRARED SOURCES WITHIN 30 pc OF THE GALACTIC CENTER},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {688},
Pages = {306-319},
Abstract = {Infrared absorption lines of H-3(+), including the metastable R(3, 3)(l)
   line, have been observed toward eight bright infrared sources associated
   with hot and massive stars located in and between the Galactic center
   cluster and the Quintuplet cluster 30 pc to the east. The absorption
   lines with high-velocity dispersion arise in the Galaxy's central
   molecular zone (CMZ) as well as in foreground spiral arms. The
   temperature and density of the gas in the CMZ, as determined from the
   relative strengths of the H-3(+) lines, are T 200-300 K and n <= 50-200
   cm(-3). The detection of high column densities of H-3(+) toward all
   eight stars implies that this warm and diffuse gaseous environment is
   widespread in the CMZ. The products of the ionization rate and path
   length for these sight lines are 1000 and 10 times higher than in dense
   and diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk, respectively, indicating that
   the ionization rate, zeta, is not less than 10(-15) s(-1) and that L is
   at least on the order of 50 pc. The warm and diffuse gas is an important
   component of the CMZ, in addition to the three previously known gaseous
   environments: ( 1) cold molecular clouds observed by radio emission of
   CO and other molecules; (2) hot (T = 10(4)-10(6) K) and highly ionized
   diffuse gas (n(e) = 10-100 cm(-3)) seen in radio recombination lines,
   far infrared atomic lines, and radio-wave scattering; and (3) ultrahot
   (T = 10(7)-10(8) K) X-ray emitting plasma. Its prevalence significantly
   changes the understanding of the environment of the CMZ. The sight line
   toward GC IRS 3 is unique in showing an additional H-3(+) absorption
   component, which is interpreted as being due to either a cloud
   associated with circumnuclear disk or the ``50 km s(-1) cloud'' known
   from radio observations. An infrared pumping scheme is examined as a
   mechanism to populate the (3,3) metastable level in this cloud.},

Pages = {951-961},
Abstract = {We present high-resolution (R = 20000) spectroscopy of H-3(+) absorption
   toward the luminous Galactic center sources GCS 3-2 and GC IRS 3. With
   the efficient wavelength coverage afforded by Subaru IRCS, six
   absorption lines of H-3(+) have been detected in each source from 3.5 to
   4.0 mum, three of which are new. In particular the 3.543 mum absorption
   line of the R(3, 3)(l) transition arising from the metastable (J, K) =
   (3, 3) state has been tentatively detected for the first time in the
   interstellar medium, where previous observations of H-3(+) had been
   limited to absorption lines from the lowest levels: (J, K) = (1, 0) of
   ortho-H-3(+) and (1, 1) of para-H-3(+).
   The H-3(+) absorption toward the Galactic center takes place in dense
   and diffuse clouds along the line of sight as well as the molecular
   complex close to the Galactic nucleus. At least four kinematic
   components are found in the H-3(+) absorption lines. We suggest
   identifications of the velocity components with those of H I, CO, and
   H2CO previously reported from radio and infrared observations. H I
   components with velocities that match those of weak and sharp CO and
   H2CO lines are attributed to diffuse clouds. Our observation has
   revealed a striking difference between the absorption profiles of H-3(+)
   and CO, demonstrating that the spectroscopy of H-3(+) provides
   information complementary to that obtained from CO spectroscopy.
   The tentative detection of the R(3, 3)(l) line and the non-detection of
   spectral lines from other J > 1 levels provide observational evidence
   for the metastability of the (3, 3) level, which is theoretically
   expected. This suggests that other metastable J = K levels with higher J
   may also be populated.},

Year = {2006},
Volume = {364},
Pages = {3107-3112},
Abstract = {Simulations of the thermal and dynamical evolution of primordial gas
   typically focus on the role played by H-2 cooling. H-2 is the dominant
   coolant in low-density primordial gas and it is usually assumed that it
   remains dominant at high densities. However, H-2 is not an effective
   coolant at high densities, owing to the low critical density at which it
   reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium and to the large opacities that
   develop in its emission lines. It is therefore important to quantify the
   contribution made to the cooling rate by emission from the other
   molecules and ions present in the gas. A particularly interesting
   candidate is the H-3(+) ion, which is known to be an effective coolant
   at high densities in planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we present
   results from simulations of the thermal and chemical evolution of
   gravitationally collapsing primordial gas, which include a detailed
   treatment of H-3(+) chemistry and an approximate treatment of H-3(+)
   cooling. We show that in most cases, the contribution from H-3(+) is too
   small to be important, but if a sufficiently strong ionizing background
   is present, then H-3(+) cooling may become significant.},

   substantially dissociated (at large orbital distances) have a layer in
   which H-3(+) is the major ion at the base of the ionosphere. For
   fast-rotating planets, densities of short-lived H-3(+) undergo
   significant diurnal variations, with the maximum value being driven by
   the stellar X-ray flux. In contrast, densities of longer-lived H+ show
   very little day/night variability and the magnitude is driven by the
   level of stellar EUV flux. The H-3(+) peak in EGPs with upper
   atmospheres where H-2 is dissociated (orbiting close to their star)
   under strong stellar illumination is pushed to altitudes below the
   homopause, where this ion is likely to be destroyed through reactions
   with heavy species (e.g. hydrocarbons, water). The inclusion of
   secondary ionisation processes produces significantly enhanced ion and
   electron densities at altitudes below the main EUV ionisation peak, as
   compared to models that do not include electron-impact ionisation. We
   estimate infrared emissions from H-3(+), and while, in an H/H-2/He
   atmosphere, these are larger from planets orbiting close to more active
   stars, they still appear too low to be detected with current

Abstract = {{Infrared absorption lines of H-3(+), including the metastable R(3, 3)(l)
   line, have been observed toward eight bright infrared sources associated
   with hot and massive stars located in and between the Galactic center
   cluster and the Quintuplet cluster 30 pc to the east. The absorption
   lines with high-velocity dispersion arise in the Galaxy's central
   molecular zone (CMZ) as well as in foreground spiral arms. The
   temperature and density of the gas in the CMZ, as determined from the
   relative strengths of the H-3(+) lines, are T 200-300 K and n <= 50-200
   cm(-3). The detection of high column densities of H-3(+) toward all
   eight stars implies that this warm and diffuse gaseous environment is
   widespread in the CMZ. The products of the ionization rate and path
   length for these sight lines are 1000 and 10 times higher than in dense
   and diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk, respectively, indicating that
   the ionization rate, zeta, is not less than 10(-15) s(-1) and that L is
   at least on the order of 50 pc. The warm and diffuse gas is an important
   component of the CMZ, in addition to the three previously known gaseous
   environments: ( 1) cold molecular clouds observed by radio emission of
   CO and other molecules; (2) hot (T = 10(4)-10(6) K) and highly ionized
   diffuse gas (n(e) = 10-100 cm(-3)) seen in radio recombination lines,
   far infrared atomic lines, and radio-wave scattering; and (3) ultrahot
   (T = 10(7)-10(8) K) X-ray emitting plasma. Its prevalence significantly
   changes the understanding of the environment of the CMZ. The sight line
   toward GC IRS 3 is unique in showing an additional H-3(+) absorption
   component, which is interpreted as being due to either a cloud
   associated with circumnuclear disk or the ``50 km s(-1) cloud'' known
   from radio observations. An infrared pumping scheme is examined as a
   mechanism to populate the (3,3) metastable level in this cloud.}},

The exquisite sensitivity and very high spectral and, more recently, spatial resolution, of modern telescopes has enabled the physics of star formation to be probed through rotational line emission. In this article, I review the basic properties of interstellar clouds and the processes that initiate the chemistry and generate chemical complexity, particularly in regions of star and planet formation. Our understanding of astrochemistry has evolved over the years. Before 1990, the general consensus was that molecules were formed in binary, gas-phase, or volume, reactions, most importantly ion-neutral reactions despite the very low ionization in clouds. Since then, observations have indicated unambiguously that there is also a contribution from surface processes, particularly on the icy mantles that form around refractory grain cores in cold, dense gas. The balance between these two processes depends on particular physical conditions and can vary during the life cycle of a particular volume of interstellar cloud. The complex chemistry that occurs in space is driven mostly through interaction of the gas with cosmic ray protons, a source of ionization that enables a rich ion-neutral chemistry. In addition, I show that the interaction between the gas and the dust in cold, dense regions also leads to additional chemical complexity through reactions that take place in ices at only a few tens of degrees above absolute zero. Although densities are low compared to those in terrestrial environments, the extremely long life times of interstellar clouds and their enormous sizes, enable complex molecules to be synthesised and detected. I show that in some instances, particularly in reactions involving deuterium, the rotational populations of reactants, together with spin-selection rules, can determine the detailed abundances. Although the review is mainly focused on regions associated with star formation, I also consider chemistry in other interesting astronomical regions—in the early Universe and in the envelopes formed by mass loss during the final stages of stellar evolution.}

Abstract = {{The majority of planetary aurorae are produced by electrical currents
   flowing between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere which accelerate
   energetic charged particles that hit the upper atmosphere. At Saturn,
   these processes collisionally excite hydrogen, causing ultraviolet
   emission(1-8), and ionize the hydrogen, leading to H-3(+) infrared
   emission(9-15). Although the morphology of these aurorae is affected by
   changes in the solar wind(6,11), the source of the currents which
   produce them is a matter of debate(16,17). Recent models predict only
   weak emission away from the main auroral oval(18). Here we report images
   that show emission both poleward and equatorward of the main oval
   (separated by a region of low emission). The extensive polar emission is
   highly variable with time, and disappears when the main oval has a
   spiral morphology; this suggests that although the polar emission may be
   associated with minor increases in the dynamic pressure from the solar
   wind, it is not directly linked to strong magnetospheric compressions.
   This aurora appears to be unique to Saturn and cannot be explained using
   our current understanding of Saturn's magnetosphere. The equatorward arc
   of emission exists only on the nightside of the planet, and arises from
   internal magnetospheric processes that are currently unknown.}},

   formed through interactions with plasma from the moon Io inside its

   observed and there remains much debate over its origin. Here we report
   the discovery of a secondary oval at Saturn that is similar to 25 per

   emission in the L' band, using spectra of HD 209458 obtained during and
   after secondary eclipse of its transiting planet HD 209458 b. We
   searched for H-3(+) emission signatures in spectra containing the
   combined light of the star and, possibly, the planet. With the
   information on the ephemeris of the transiting planet, we derive the
   radial velocities at the time of observation and search for the emission
   at the expected line positions. We also apply a cross-correlation test
   to search for planetary signals and use a shift and add technique
   combining all observed spectra taken after secondary eclipse to
   calculate an upper emission limit. We do not find signatures of
   atmospheric H-3(+) emission in the spectra containing the combined light
   of HD 209458 and its orbiting planet. We calculate the emission limit

   Comparing our emission limits to the theoretical predictions suggests
   that we lack 1 to 3 magnitudes of sensitivity to measure H-3(+) emission

Abstract = {{The H-3(+) ion is widely believed to play an important role in
   interstellar chemistry, by initiating the chains of reactions that lead
   to the production of many of the complex molecular species observed in
   the interstellar medium(1-5). The presence of H-3(+) in the interstellar
   medium was first suggested(6) in 1961, and its infrared spectrum was
   measured(7) in the laboratory in 1980. But attempts(8-11) to detect it
   in interstellar space have hitherto proved unsuccessful, Here we report
   the detection of H-3(+) absorption in the spectra of two molecular
   clouds. Ali-hough the present results do not permit an accurate
   determination of the H-3(+) abundances, these ions appear nevertheless
   to be present in sufficient quantities to drive much of the chemistry in
   molecular clouds, It should soon be possible to obtain more accurate
   measurements, and thus better quantify the role of ion-neutral reactions
   in the chemical evolution of molecular clouds.}},

Abstract = {{Neptune and Uranus are observed with Keck II NIRSPEC in an attempt to

   LEVELS OF 3-ATOM AND 4-ATOM MOLECULES},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {8519-8541},
Abstract = {{We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
   levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation.  The
   method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
   of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
   iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
   vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
   as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions in each
   off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more than cn(f+1)
   multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates. Choosing a
   (potential optimized) discrete variable representation (DVR) in each
   dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal. The rate-determining
   step is now the multiplication of a vector by the kinetic energy matrix
   and c is effectively (with rare exceptions) at most two. The n(f+1)
   scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed second derivative operators.
   The method is directly applicable to any three-atom and any nonlinear
   four-atom molecule. We use a variety of coordinate systems (Jacobi,
   Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond), for which the total number of
   factorizable terms in the exact kinetic energy operator is never large,
   to calculate very well-converged band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1,
   of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1, and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying
   levels of H2O2. The results for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify
   the causes of discrepancies in published work. The product basis results
   in very large matrices (up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the
   cost is within an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis
   approaches using explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis
   approaches are molecule and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to
   apply the DVR-Lanczos method to all the examples presented here with a
   single computer program. The principal advantage of our method is thus
   its generality, and in this context it is efficient, with the cost
   scaling slowly with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.}},

Abstract = {{Several techniques of varying efficiency are investigated, which treat
   all singularities present in the triatomic vibrational kinetic energy
   operator given in orthogonal internal coordinates of the two
   distances-one angle type. The strategies are based on the use of a
   direct-product basis built from one-imensional discrete variable
   representation (DVR) bases corresponding to the two distances and
   orthogonal Legendre polynomials, or the corresponding Legendre-DVR
   basis, corresponding to the angle. The use of Legendre functions ensures
   the efficient treatment of the angular singularity. Matrix elements of
   the singular radial operators are calculated employing DVRs using the
   quadrature approximation as well as special DVRs satisfying the boundary
   conditions and thus allowing for the use of exact DVR expressions.
   Potential optimized ( PO) radial DVRs, based on one-dimensional
   Hamiltonians with potentials obtained by fixing or relaxing the two
   non-active coordinates, are also studied. The numerical calculations
   employed Hermite-DVR, spherical-oscillator-DVR, and Bessel-DVR bases as
   the primitive radial functions. A new analytical formula is given for
   the determination of the matrix elements of the singular radial operator
   using the Bessel-DVR basis. The usually claimed failure of the
   quadrature approximation in certain singular integrals is revisited in
   one and three dimensions. It is shown that as long as no potential
   optimization is carried out the quadrature approximation works almost as
   well as the exact DVR expressions. If wave functions with finite
   amplitude at the boundary are to be computed, the basis sets need to
   meet the required boundary conditions. The present numerical results
   also confirm that PO-DVRs should be constructed employing relaxed
   potentials and PO-DVRs can be useful for optimizing quadrature points
   for calculations applying large coordinate intervals and describing
   large-amplitude motions. The utility and efficiency of the different
   algorithms is demonstrated by the computation of converged
   near-dissociation vibrational energy levels for the H-3(+) molecular
   ion.}},

journal = {J.  Chem.  Soc., Faraday Trans. },
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {847-860},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional variational calculations of bound and resonance
   spectra of the H-3(+) molecular ion for the total angular momentum J = 0
   are presented. All N-E + N-A1 + N-A2 = 2 x 604 + 358 + 256 bound states
   of the MBB PES and some N-H + N-A1 + N-A2 = 2 x 264 + 142 + 119
   resonances with widths Gamma < 100 cm(-1) are computed.
   Such calculations are very challenging due to (i) a very deep
   potential-energy well which gives rise to a high density of bound and
   resonance states and (ii) the floppiness of the H,+ molecular ion which
   leads to various numerical difficulties. The computation was done using
   the filter diagonalization method. Here a series of subspace
   diagonalizations is performed on a Hamiltonian with a complex absorbing
   potential, (H) over cap - <i(W)over cap>, represented in a relatively
   small adapted basis set. Each small basis set is obtained by acting with
   the ABC (absorbing boundary conditions) Green's function on an initial
   wavepacket, using the modified by ABC Chebyshev recursion polynomial
   expansion. The method is described in some detail. Additionally, we
   describe an efficient and simple procedure of using Jacobi coordinate
   DVR (discrete variable representation) for a floppy triatomic molecule
   resulting in a sparse Hamiltonian matrix with a small spectral range,
   which in particular, overcomes the slow convergence of iterative Krylov
   type methods. Comparison between the present version of the filter
   diagonalization and the Lanczos method is made.
   The level statistics of the H-3(+) bound and resonance states are
   analysed showing the strongly chaotic nature of the spectra, starting
   already at very moderate energies, caused by the extreme floppiness of
   the system. The widths of computed resonances fluctuate by orders of
   magnitude. At energies just above the dissociation threshold the
   resonances are essentially very narrow and isolated, but start to
   overlap very quickly as energy increases. The number of resonance states
   per effective decay channel is sufficient to carry out a statistical
   analysis of decay rates by fitting their distribution to the chi(2)
   distribution with nu(eff) degrees of freedom, where nu(eff) is the
   effective number of decay channels. The result of this analysis is
   however negative, suggesting that the concept of average width on which
   it is partially based is not correct when resonances are overlapping,
   and that more reliable statistical theories of the effective Hamiltonian
   must be developed for the barrierless reactions.}},

Title = {{Complete depletion in prestellar cores}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{418}},
Pages = {1035-1043},
Abstract = {{We have carried out calculations of ionization equilibrium and deuterium
   fractionation for conditions appropriate to a completely depleted, low
   mass pre-protostellar core, where heavy elements such as C, N, and O
   have vanished from the gas phase and are incorporated in ice mantles
   frozen on dust grain surfaces. We put particular emphasis on the
   interpretation of recent observations of H2D+ towards the centre of the
   prestellar core L 1544 (Caselli et al. 2003) and also compute the
   ambipolar diffusion timescale. We consider explicitly the ortho and para
   forms of H-2, H-3(+), and H2D+. Our results show that the ionization
   degree under such conditions depends sensitively on the grain size
   distribution or, more precisely, on the mean grain surface area per
   hydrogen nucleus. Depending upon this parameter and upon density, the
   major ion may be H+, H-3(+), or D-3(+) We show that the abundance of
   ortho-H2D+ observed towards L 1544 can be explained satisfactorily in
   terms of a complete depletion model and that this species is, as a
   consequence, ail important tracer of the kinematics of prestellar cores.}},

Title = {{The chemical evolution of cool white dwarfs and the age of the local
   galactic disk}},
Journal = ApJS,
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {339-387},
Abstract = {{Photometric and spectroscopic observations of 110 cool white dwarf stars
   are presented and analyzed with state-of-the-art model atmosphere
   calculations appropriate for cool white dwarfs with pure hydrogen and
   pure helium, as well as mixed H/He compositions. High signal-to-noise
   spectroscopy reveals the presence of H alpha in 20 white dwarfs
   previously classified as DC stars, four of which are magnetic. Cool
   white dwarfs are shown to form a narrow sequence in both color-color and
   color-magnitude diagrams, with little evidence for separation between
   hydrogen- and helium-rich compositions in these diagrams. The observed
   energy distributions are obtained from a combination of both optical
   BVRI and infrared JHK photometric data and used to derive both the
   effective temperature and the atmospheric composition of each star.
   Stellar masses are also obtained for 60 white dwarfs with known
   trigonometric parallaxes. Some discrepancies between the observed energy
   distributions and those predicted by the model atmospheres are
   described. In particular, evidence for the presence of a UV opacity
   source in the coolest hydrogen-rich white dwarfs is interpreted in terms
   of a pseudo continuum opacity originating from the Lyman edge.
   The simultaneous analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic
   observations provides a detailed picture of the chemical composition of
   cool white dwarfs. Most cool white dwarfs have energy distributions that
   are well reproduced by either pure hydrogen or pure helium models, with
   little evidence for objects with mixed atmospheric compositions. We
   identify a peculiar class of non-DA star with T-eff > 6000 K whose
   energy distributions are well reproduced by pure hydrogen models but
   whose spectra do not show Ha. Our results reveal an inhomogeneous
   temperature distribution of hydrogen- and helium-rich white dwarfs, and
   in particular the presence of a non-DA gap in the range 5000 less than
   or similar to T-eff less than or similar to 6000 K. The chemical
   evolution of cool white dwarfs is discussed at length with respect to
   our findings. We show that no known physical mechanisms (e.g.,
   convective mixing, convective dredge-up, accretion from the interstellar
   medium) can account for the temperature distribution of hydrogen- and
   helium-rich white dwarfs. Possible new mechanisms that could explain our
   results are presented. We propose a mechanism by which hydrogen is
   accreted onto the surface of helium-rich white dwarfs while remaining
   spectroscopically invisible. Observational evidence that supports our
   hypothesis is discussed.
   Lower limits for the age of the local Galactic disk are obtained by
   determining the age of the oldest white dwarfs in our sample. Ages in
   the range 6.5-10 Gyr are derived from evolutionary models with various
   core compositions and helium envelope masses.}},
