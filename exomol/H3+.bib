   a model (M2) describing the reactions as H-, H+-, D-, and D+-transfer

      benchmark polyatomic system for high-level electronic-structure
      computations, as well as for quantum dynamics studies. In this work,
      exact quantum dynamical calculations are carried out for H-3(+), using
      the ScalIT suite of parallel codes, applied to two spectroscopically
      accurate potential energy surfaces. Specifically, rovibrational energy
      levels and wavefunctions are computed and labeled. Sixty vibrational
      states (for J = 0) are first determined, and then, rotational
      excitations for each of these ``vibrational parent{''} states are
      computed up to total angular momentum J = 46, which is the highest value
      for which bound states of this molecule exist (D-0 similar to 35 000

      contributed greatly to astrochemistry, and experiment and theory have
      both developed tremendously throughout the years, following the

      H-3(+) transitions were obtained using an action spectroscopy technique,
      employing stored H-3(+) ions in a cryogenic ion trap. This approach was
      pioneered by Schlemmer and Gerlich for N-2(+) , and is widely used today

      ions. In this work, we explore the possibility to extend the range for
      H-3(+) action spectroscopy even further, into the regime above 20000

   Journal = AA,
   Year = {2019},
   Volume = {632},
   pages = {A29},
   Abstract = {Context. Deuterated interstellar molecules frequently have abundances
      relative to their main isotopologues much higher than the overall
      elemental D-to-H ratio in the cold dense interstellar medium. H-3(+) and
      its isotopologues play a key role in the deuterium fractionation;
      however, the abundances of these isotopologues have not been measured
      empirically with respect to H-3(+) to date.
      Aims. Our aim was to constrain the relative abundances of H2D+ and
      D-3(+) in the cold outer envelope of the hot core CRL 2136 IRS 1.
      Methods. We carried out three observations targeting H-3(+) and its
      isotopologues using the spectrographs CRIRES at the VLT, iSHELL at IRTF,
      and EXES on board SOFIA. In addition, the CO overtone band at 2.3 mu m
      was observed by iSHELL to characterize the gas on the line of sight.
      Results. The H-3(+) ion was detected toward CRL 2136 IRS 1 as in
      previous observations. Spectroscopy of lines of H2D+ and D-3(+) resulted
      in non-detections. The 3 sigma upper limits of N(H2D+)/N(H-3(+)) and
      N(D-3(+))=N(H-3(+)) are 0.24 and 0.13, respectively. The population
      diagram for CO is reproduced by two components of warm gas with the
      temperatures 58 and 530 K, assuming a local thermodynamic equilibrium
      (LTE) distribution of the rotational levels. Cold gas (<20 K) makes only
      a minor contribution to the CO molecular column toward CRL 2136 IRS 1.
      Conclusions. The critical conditions for deuterium fractionation in a
      dense cloud are low temperature and CO depletion. Given the revised
      cloud properties, it is no surprise that H-3(+) isotopologues are not
      detected toward CRL 2136 IRS 1. The result is consistent with our
      current understanding of how deuterium fractionation proceeds.},

   deposition is included through photo-ionisation and electron-impact
   processes. The former is calculated by solving the Lambert-Beer law,
   while the latter is calculated from a supra-thermal electron transport
   model. We find that EGP ionospheres at all orbital distances considered
   (0.1-1 AU) and around all stars selected are dominated by the long-lived
   H+ ion. In addition, planets with upper atmospheres where H-2 is not
   substantially dissociated (at large orbital distances) have a layer in
   which H-3(+) is the major ion at the base of the ionosphere. For
   fast-rotating planets, densities of short-lived H-3(+) undergo
   significant diurnal variations, with the maximum value being driven by
   the stellar X-ray flux. In contrast, densities of longer-lived H+ show
   very little day/night variability and the magnitude is driven by the
   level of stellar EUV flux. The H-3(+) peak in EGPs with upper
   atmospheres where H-2 is dissociated (orbiting close to their star)
   under strong stellar illumination is pushed to altitudes below the
   homopause, where this ion is likely to be destroyed through reactions
   with heavy species (e.g. hydrocarbons, water). The inclusion of
   secondary ionisation processes produces significantly enhanced ion and
   electron densities at altitudes below the main EUV ionisation peak, as
   compared to models that do not include electron-impact ionisation. We
   estimate infrared emissions from H-3(+), and while, in an H/H-2/He
   atmosphere, these are larger from planets orbiting close to more active
   stars, they still appear too low to be detected with current
   observatories.},

Journal = AA,

Abstract = {Close-in extrasolar giant planets are expected to cool their
   thermospheres by producing H-3(+) emission in the near-infrared (NIR),
   but simulations predict H-3(+) emission intensities that differ in the
   resulting intensity by several orders of magnitude. We want to test the
   observability of H-3(+) emission with CRIRES at the Very Large Telescope
   (VLT), providing adequate spectral resolution for planetary atmospheric
   lines in NIR spectra. We search for signatures of planetary H-3(+)
   emission in the L' band, using spectra of HD 209458 obtained during and
   after secondary eclipse of its transiting planet HD 209458 b. We
   searched for H-3(+) emission signatures in spectra containing the
   combined light of the star and, possibly, the planet. With the
   information on the ephemeris of the transiting planet, we derive the
   radial velocities at the time of observation and search for the emission
   at the expected line positions. We also apply a cross-correlation test
   to search for planetary signals and use a shift and add technique
   combining all observed spectra taken after secondary eclipse to
   calculate an upper emission limit. We do not find signatures of
   atmospheric H-3(+) emission in the spectra containing the combined light
   of HD 209458 and its orbiting planet. We calculate the emission limit
   for the H-3(+) line at 3953.0 nm {[}Q(1; 0)] to be 8.32 x 10(18) W and a
   limit of 5.34 x 10(18) W for the line at 3985.5 nm {[}Q(3, 0)].
   Comparing our emission limits to the theoretical predictions suggests
   that we lack 1 to 3 magnitudes of sensitivity to measure H-3(+) emission
   in our target object. We show that under more favorable weather
   conditions the data quality can be improved significantly, reaching 5 x
   10(16) W for star-planet systems that are close to Earth. We estimate
   that pushing the detection limit down to 10(15) W will be possible with
   ground-based observations with future instrumentation, for example, the
   European Extremly Large Telescope.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {818},
pages = {107},
Abstract = {By varying the profiles of stellar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral
   energy distributions (SEDs), we tested the influences of stellar EUV
   SEDs on the physical and chemical properties of an escaping atmosphere.
   We apply our model to study four exoplanets: HD 189733b, HD 209458b, GJ
   436b, and Kepler-11b. We find that the total mass loss rates of an
   exoplanet, which are determined mainly by the integrated fluxes, are
   moderately affected by the profiles of the EUV SED, but the composition
   and species distributions in the atmosphere can be dramatically modified
   by the different profiles of the EUV SED. For exoplanets with a high
   hydrodynamic escape parameter (.), the amount of atomic hydrogen
   produced by photoionization at different altitudes can vary by one to
   two orders of magnitude with the variation of stellar EUV SEDs. The
   effect of photoionization of H is prominent when the EUV SED is
   dominated by the low-energy spectral region (400-900 angstrom), which
   pushes the transition of H/H+ to low altitudes. In contrast, the
   transition of H/H+ moves to higher altitudes when most photons are
   concentrated in the high-energy spectral region (50-400 angstrom). For
   exoplanets with a low., the lower temperatures of the atmosphere make
   many chemical reactions so important that photoionization alone can no
   longer determine the composition of the escaping atmosphere. For HD
   189733b, it is possible to explain the time variability of Ly alpha
   between 2010 and 2011 by a change in the EUV SED of the host K-type
   star, yet invoking only thermal H I in the atmosphere.},

Abstract = {This is the second paper in a series where we build a self-consistent
   model to simulate the mass-loss process of a close-orbit magnetized
   giant exoplanet, so-called hot Jupiter (HJ). In this paper we generalize
   the hydrodynamic (HD) model of an HJ's expanding hydrogen atmosphere,
   proposed in the first paper, to include the effects of intrinsic
   planetary magnetic field. The proposed self-consistent axisymmetric 2D
   magnetohydrodynamics model incorporates radiative heating and ionization
   of the atmospheric gas, basic hydrogen chemistry for the appropriate
   account of major species composing HJ's upper atmosphere and related
   radiative energy deposition, and. H-3(+) and Ly alpha cooling processes.
   The model also takes into account a realistic solar-type X-ray/EUV
   spectrum for calculation of intensity and column density distribution of
   the radiative energy input, as well as gravitational and rotational
   forces acting in a tidally locked planet-star system. An interaction
   between the expanding atmospheric plasma and an intrinsic planetary
   magnetic dipole field leads to the formation of a current-carrying
   magnetodisk that plays an important role for topology and scaling of the
   planetary magnetosphere. A cyclic character of the magnetodisk behavior,
   composed of consequent phases of the disk formation followed by the
   magnetic reconnection with the ejection of a ring-type plasmoid, has
   been discovered and investigated. We found that the mass-loss rate of an

been found in the harsh environment of the interstellar medium. The exquisite sensitivity
and very high spectral and, more recently, spatial resolution, of modern telescopes
has enabled the physics of star formation to be probed through rotational line emission.
In this article, I review the basic properties of interstellar clouds and the processes
that initiate the chemistry and generate chemical complexity, particularly in regions
of star and planet formation. Our understanding of astrochemistry has evolved over
the years. Before 1990, the general consensus was that molecules were formed in
binary, gas-phase, or volume, reactions, most importantly ion-neutral reactions
despite the very low ionization in clouds. Since then, observations have indicated
unambiguously that there is also a contribution from surface processes, particularly
on the icy mantles that form around refractory grain cores in cold, dense gas. The
balance between these two processes depends on particular physical conditions and
can vary during the life cycle of a particular volume of interstellar cloud. The
complex chemistry that occurs in space is driven mostly through interaction of the
gas with cosmic ray protons, a source of ionization that enables a rich ion-neutral
chemistry. In addition, I show that the interaction between the gas and the dust in
cold, dense regions also leads to additional chemical complexity through reactions
that take place in ices at only a few tens of degrees above absolute zero. Although
densities are low compared to those in terrestrial environments, the extremely long
life times of interstellar clouds and their enormous sizes, enable complex molecules
to be synthesised and detected. I show that in some instances, particularly in
reactions involving deuterium, the rotational populations of reactants, together
with spin-selection rules, can determine the detailed abundances. Although the
review is mainly focused on regions associated with star formation, I also consider
chemistry in other interesting astronomical regions—in the early Universe and in the
envelopes formed by mass loss during the final stages of stellar evolution.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {745},
pages = {91},
Abstract = {Observations of H-3(+) in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium have
   led to various surprising results, including the conclusion that the
   cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta(2)) is about one order of magnitude
   larger than previously thought. The present survey expands the sample of
   diffuse cloud sight lines with H-3(+) observations to 50, with
   detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates inferred from these
   observations are in the range (1.7 +/- 1.3) x 10(-16) s(-1) < zeta(2) <
   (10.6 +/- 8.2) x 10(-16) s(-1) with a mean value of zeta(2) =
   (3.5(-3.0)(+5.3)) x 10(-16) s(-1). Upper limits (3 sigma) derived from
   non-detections of H-3(+) are as low as.2 < 0.4 x 10-16 s-1. These low
   upper limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray
   ionization rates, indicate variations in zeta(2) between different
   diffuse cloud sight lines. A study of zeta(2) versus N-H (total hydrogen
   column density) shows that the two parameters are not correlated for
   diffuse molecular cloud sight lines, but that the ionization rate
   decreases when NH increases to values typical of dense molecular clouds.
   Both the difference in ionization rates between diffuse and dense clouds
   and the variation of zeta(2) among diffuse cloud sight lines are likely
   the result of particle propagation effects. The lower ionization rate in
   dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy (few MeV) protons to
   penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in diffuse clouds is
   controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site of particle
   acceleration.},

    two lowest ro–vibrational levels to final levels up to 16 700 cm−1, almost
    half way to the dissociation limit, have been measured, involving up to eight
    vibrational quanta. The observed transitions are more than six orders of magnitude
    less intense than the  fundamental band and yet another order of magnitude
    weaker than reached by previous sensitive action spectroscopy in the near-infrared

    Laser-induced chemical reactions lead to the formation of ArH+ ions detected
    with single-ion sensitivity. These visible measurements, together with the
    previous near-infrared measurements, have helped to further develop empirically
    corrected calculations and have provided essential benchmarks for new ab initio
    calculations that now reach a spectroscopic accuracy of 0.1 cm−1 on average up
    to the highest observed transition. Highly sensitive action spectroscopy and
    the attained high-accuracy predictions will enable us to find and measure
    transitions even further into the visible region of H, paving the way towards
    the dissociation limit.},

of H3+ into H2+ + H fragments by transitions into the first excited singlet state
with 266 and 532 nm laser beams. A clear signal could be observed up to 5 ms of
storage, indicating that enough highly excited rovibrational states survive on
the millisecond time scale of the experiment. The decay into H2+ + H shows an
effective time constant between about 1 and 1.5 ms. The initial photodissociating
states are estimated to lie roughly 1 eV below the dissociation limit of 4.4 eV.
The expected low population of these levels gives rise to an effective cross section
of several 10−20 cm2 for ultraviolet and some 10−21 cm2 for visible light. For using
multistep resonant dissociation schemes to monitor rotational populations of cold H3+
in low-density environments, these measurements open promising perspectives.},

   vibrational computations. The vibrational states of H$_3^+$ up to

Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {8373-8386},
Abstract = {Several techniques of varying efficiency are investigated, which treat
   all singularities present in the triatomic vibrational kinetic energy
   operator given in orthogonal internal coordinates of the two
   distances-one angle type. The strategies are based on the use of a
   direct-product basis built from one-imensional discrete variable
   representation (DVR) bases corresponding to the two distances and
   orthogonal Legendre polynomials, or the corresponding Legendre-DVR
   basis, corresponding to the angle. The use of Legendre functions ensures
   the efficient treatment of the angular singularity. Matrix elements of
   the singular radial operators are calculated employing DVRs using the
   quadrature approximation as well as special DVRs satisfying the boundary
   conditions and thus allowing for the use of exact DVR expressions.
   Potential optimized ( PO) radial DVRs, based on one-dimensional
   Hamiltonians with potentials obtained by fixing or relaxing the two
   non-active coordinates, are also studied. The numerical calculations
   employed Hermite-DVR, spherical-oscillator-DVR, and Bessel-DVR bases as
   the primitive radial functions. A new analytical formula is given for
   the determination of the matrix elements of the singular radial operator
   using the Bessel-DVR basis. The usually claimed failure of the
   quadrature approximation in certain singular integrals is revisited in
   one and three dimensions. It is shown that as long as no potential
   optimization is carried out the quadrature approximation works almost as
   well as the exact DVR expressions. If wave functions with finite
   amplitude at the boundary are to be computed, the basis sets need to
   meet the required boundary conditions. The present numerical results
   also confirm that PO-DVRs should be constructed employing relaxed
   potentials and PO-DVRs can be useful for optimizing quadrature points
   for calculations applying large coordinate intervals and describing
   large-amplitude motions. The utility and efficiency of the different
   algorithms is demonstrated by the computation of converged
   near-dissociation vibrational energy levels for the H-3(+) molecular ion.},

   Eight infrared sources within 30 Pc of the galactic center}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2008},

Abstract = {Infrared absorption lines of H-3(+), including the metastable R(3, 3)(l)
   line, have been observed toward eight bright infrared sources associated
   with hot and massive stars located in and between the Galactic center
   cluster and the Quintuplet cluster 30 pc to the east. The absorption
   lines with high-velocity dispersion arise in the Galaxy's central
   molecular zone (CMZ) as well as in foreground spiral arms. The
   temperature and density of the gas in the CMZ, as determined from the
   relative strengths of the H-3(+) lines, are T 200-300 K and n <= 50-200
   cm(-3). The detection of high column densities of H-3(+) toward all
   eight stars implies that this warm and diffuse gaseous environment is
   widespread in the CMZ. The products of the ionization rate and path
   length for these sight lines are 1000 and 10 times higher than in dense
   and diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk, respectively, indicating that
   the ionization rate, zeta, is not less than 10(-15) s(-1) and that L is
   at least on the order of 50 pc. The warm and diffuse gas is an important
   component of the CMZ, in addition to the three previously known gaseous
   environments: ( 1) cold molecular clouds observed by radio emission of
   CO and other molecules; (2) hot (T = 10(4)-10(6) K) and highly ionized
   diffuse gas (n(e) = 10-100 cm(-3)) seen in radio recombination lines,
   far infrared atomic lines, and radio-wave scattering; and (3) ultrahot
   (T = 10(7)-10(8) K) X-ray emitting plasma. Its prevalence significantly
   changes the understanding of the environment of the CMZ. The sight line
   toward GC IRS 3 is unique in showing an additional H-3(+) absorption
   component, which is interpreted as being due to either a cloud
   associated with circumnuclear disk or the ``50 km s(-1) cloud'' known
   from radio observations. An infrared pumping scheme is examined as a
   mechanism to populate the (3,3) metastable level in this cloud.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we have computed the rovibrational spectrum of the H-3(+)

   all permutations of the nuclei, that includes the long range
   electrostatic interactions analytically. The energy levels are obtained
   by a variational calculation using hyperspherical coordinates. From the
   comparison with available experimental results for low lying levels, we
   conclude that our accuracy is of the order of 0.1 cm(-1) for states
   localized in the vicinity of equilateral triangular configurations of
   the nuclei, and changes to the order of 1 cm(-1) when the system is
   distorted away from equilateral configurations. Full rovibrational
   spectra up to the H++H-2 dissociation energy limit have been computed.
   The statistical properties of this spectrum (nearest neighbor
   distribution and spectral rigidity) show the quantum signature of
   classical chaos and are consistent with random matrix theory. On the
   other hand, the correlation function, even when convoluted with a
   smoothing function, exhibits oscillations which are not described by
   random matrix theory. We discuss a possible similarity between these

Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {456},
Pages = {214-217},
Abstract = {The majority of planetary aurorae are produced by electrical currents
   flowing between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere which accelerate
   energetic charged particles that hit the upper atmosphere. At Saturn,
   these processes collisionally excite hydrogen, causing ultraviolet
   emission(1-8), and ionize the hydrogen, leading to H-3(+) infrared
   emission(9-15). Although the morphology of these aurorae is affected by
   changes in the solar wind(6,11), the source of the currents which
   produce them is a matter of debate(16,17). Recent models predict only
   weak emission away from the main auroral oval(18). Here we report images
   that show emission both poleward and equatorward of the main oval
   (separated by a region of low emission). The extensive polar emission is
   highly variable with time, and disappears when the main oval has a
   spiral morphology; this suggests that although the polar emission may be
   associated with minor increases in the dynamic pressure from the solar
   wind, it is not directly linked to strong magnetospheric compressions.
   This aurora appears to be unique to Saturn and cannot be explained using
   our current understanding of Saturn's magnetosphere. The equatorward arc
   of emission exists only on the nightside of the planet, and arises from
   internal magnetospheric processes that are currently unknown.},

Abstract = {Planetary aurorae are formed by energetic charged particles streaming
   along the planet's magnetic field lines into the upper atmosphere from

   through interactions with the solar wind(1), whereas that at Jupiter is
   formed through interactions with plasma from the moon Io inside its
   magnetic field (although other processes form aurorae at both
   planets(2,3)). At Saturn, only the main auroral oval has previously been
   observed and there remains much debate over its origin. Here we report
   the discovery of a secondary oval at Saturn that is similar to 25 per
   cent as bright as the main oval, and we show this to be caused by
   interaction with the middle magnetosphere around the planet. This is a
   weak equivalent of Jupiter's main oval, its relative dimness being due
   to the lack of as large a source of ions as Jupiter's volcanic moon Io.
   This result suggests that differences seen in the auroral emissions from
   Saturn and Jupiter are due to scaling differences in the conditions at
   each of these two planets, whereas the underlying formation processes

Here we show that there is a sharp breakdown in atmospheric stability between 0.14
and 0.16 au for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a solar-type star. These results
are in contrast to earlier modelling4,8 that implied much higher thermospheric
temperatures and more significant evaporation farther from the star. (We use a
three-dimensional, time-dependent coupled thermosphere–ionosphere model6 and properly
include cooling by H3+ ions, allowing us to model globally the redistribution of
heat and changes in molecular composition.) Between 0.2 and 0.16 au cooling by
H3+ ions balances heating by the star, but inside 0.16 au molecular hydrogen
dissociates thermally, suppressing the formation of H3+ and effectively shutting
down that mode of cooling.},

collision dynamics are available to date, especially at the low energies required
for astrochemistry. Instead of treating state-to-state dynamics with state of the
art methods, predictions are still based on: (i) simple thermodynamical arguments,
(ii) crude reaction models such as H atom exchange or proton jump, or (iii)
statistical considerations used for describing processes proceeding via long-lived
or strongly interacting collision complexes. A central problem is to properly
account for the consequences of the fact that H and D are fermions and bosons,
respectively. In the experimental and results sections, it is emphasized that
although a variety of innovative techniques are available and have been used for
measuring rate coefficients, cross-sections or state-to-state transition probabilities,
the definitive experiments are still pending. In the centre of this contribution
are our activities on various m+n=5 systems. We report a few selected additional
results for collisions of hydrogen ions with p-H2, o-H2, HD, D2 or well-defined
mixtures of these neutrals. Most of the recent experiments are based on temperature
variable multipole ion traps and their combination with pulsed gas inlets,
molecular beams, laser probing or electron beams. Based on the state-specific
model calculations, it is concluded that for completely understanding the gas
phase formation and destruction of Inline Formula in a trap, an in situ characterization
of all the experimental parameters is required with unprecedented accuracy.
Finally, the need to understand the hydrogen chemistry relevant for dense pre-stellar

Abstract = {Simulations of the thermal and dynamical evolution of primordial gas
   typically focus on the role played by H-2 cooling. H-2 is the dominant
   coolant in low-density primordial gas and it is usually assumed that it
   remains dominant at high densities. However, H-2 is not an effective
   coolant at high densities, owing to the low critical density at which it
   reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium and to the large opacities that
   develop in its emission lines. It is therefore important to quantify the
   contribution made to the cooling rate by emission from the other
   molecules and ions present in the gas. A particularly interesting
   candidate is the H-3(+) ion, which is known to be an effective coolant
   at high densities in planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we present
   results from simulations of the thermal and chemical evolution of
   gravitationally collapsing primordial gas, which include a detailed
   treatment of H-3(+) chemistry and an approximate treatment of H-3(+)
   cooling. We show that in most cases, the contribution from H-3(+) is too
   small to be important, but if a sufficiently strong ionizing background
   is present, then H-3(+) cooling may become significant.},

abstract = {In the past several years, great progress has been made on the spectroscopy
of polyatomic molecules in diffuse interstellar clouds. In this talk, I will
review recent developments involving H, C, and the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs).
The simplest polyatomic molecular ion, H, has long been recognized as the cornerstone
of ion-neutral chemistry in dense molecular clouds (Herbst & Klemperer 1973; Watson 1973).
However, in diffuse clouds (where electrons are abundantly produced from photoionization
of atomic carbon) the H number density was expected to be considerably lower than in dense
clouds, owing to the efficiency of electron recombination. It was, therefore, a surprise
when a large column density of H was detected (McCall et al.1998) in the diffuse
line of sight towards Cygnus OB2 12, and subsequently in a sample of heavily reddened
diffuse sightlines (McCall et al.2002). Recently, we have detected H even in the
classical diffuse cloud sightline towards Persei; together with a new measurement
of the electron recombination rate coefficient, this result suggests that the
cosmic-ray ionization rate is much higher in diffuse clouds than in dense clouds (McCall et al. 2003a)!
In 2001, interstellar C was first detected by J. P. Maier and colleagues (maier et al. 2001)
in three diffuse cloud sightlines. This was quickly followed up by another detection
(Roueff et al. 2002) and a survey conducted at low-resolution (Okaet al. 2003).
This was followed by a high-resolution survey (Ádámkovics, Blake, & McCall 2003)
that yielded rotationally resolved spectra of C in 10 sightlines. Much like C,
C has no permanent dipole moment, and therefore its rotational distribution serves
as a sensitive diagnostic of both temperature and density. The existence of larger
polyatomic molecules in diffuse clouds is clear from the presence of the DIBs,
which have remained an enigma since their discovery some eight decades ago. A
recent survey of the DIBs at the Apache Point Observatory has resulted in a uniform
sample of DIB spectra with much higher signal-to-noise ratios than previously
available. Some early results from the analysis of the survey data include the
identification of a set of DIBs that are related to C (Thorburn et al. 2003) as
well as some well-correlated pairs of DIBs. I will discuss our recent results.},

Abstract = {Using an absorption line from the metastable (J; K) ( 3; 3) level of
   H-3(+) together with other lines of H-3(+) and CO observed along several
   sight lines, we have discovered a vast amount of high-temperature (T
   similar to 250 K) and low-density (n similar to 100 cm(-3)) gas with a
   large velocity dispersion in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the
   Galaxy, i. e., within 200 pc of the center. Approximately three-fourths
   of the H-3(+) along the line of sight to the brightest source we
   observed, the Quintuplet object GCS 3-2, is inferred to be in the CMZ,
   with the remaining H-3(+) located in intervening spiral arms. About half
   of the H-3(+) in the CMZ has velocities near similar to -100 km s(-1),
   indicating that it is associated with the 180 pc radius expanding
   molecular ring, which approximately forms the outer boundary of the CMZ.
   The other half, with velocities of similar to -50 and similar to 0 km
   s(-1), is probably closer to the center. CO is not very abundant in
   these clouds. Hot and diffuse gas in which the (3, 3) level is populated
   was not detected toward several dense clouds and diffuse clouds in the
   Galactic disk where large column densities of colder H-3(+) have been
   reported previously. Thus, the newly discovered environment appears to
   be unique to the CMZ. The large observed H-3(+) column densities in the
   CMZ suggest an ionization rate much higher than in the diffuse
   interstellar medium in the Galactic disk. Our finding that the H-3(+) in
   the CMZ is almost entirely in diffuse clouds indicates that the reported
   volume filling factor (f >= 0.1) for n >= 10(4) cm(-3) clouds in the CMZ
   is an overestimate by at least an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Although Himg1.gif is nonpolar in the equilateral triangle equilibrium
structure, symmetry breakdown due to centrifugal distortion causes a small dipole
moment and hence rotational transitions. The spontaneous emission times are on the
order of a few weeks for low rotational levels and are comparable to collision
intervals in interstellar space. Moreover, there are metastable rotational levels
such as J = K = 3, from which spontaneous emissions are rigorously forbidden.
A very nonthermal rotational distribution is produced. We present a model calculation
simulating the thermalization of Himg1.gif. Since the lifetime of Himg1.gif in
interstellar space is orders of magnitude longer than the spontaneous emission
time and collision intervals, a steady state approximation is assumed. Accurate
theoretical values by ab initio theory are used for spontaneous emission rates.
The rates of collision-induced transitions between rotational levels are calculated
on the assumption of completely random selection rules using an approximate
formula that satisfies the principle of detailed balancing. The results indicate
that the observed high population of Himg1.gif in the (3, 3) metastable level
toward the Galactic center (M. Goto and coworkers) signifies the presence of
very large high-temperature (T ≥ 300 K) and low-density [n(H2) ≤ 70 cm-3] clouds.
It is shown that other higher metastable levels may accommodate observable Himg1.gif
in such clouds and that the excitation temperature determined from the observed
relative populations of (1, 0) and (1, 1) should provide crucial information on
the condition of such clouds.},

abstract = {The H3+ molecular ion plays a fundamental role in interstellar chemistry,
as it initiates a network of chemical reactions that produce many molecules1,2.
In dense interstellar clouds, the H3+ abundance is understood using a simple
chemical model, from which observations of H3+ yield valuable estimates of cloud
path length, density and temperature3,4. But observations of diffuse clouds have
suggested that H3+ is considerably more abundant than expected from the chemical
models5,6,7. Models of diffuse clouds have, however, been hampered by the uncertain
values of three key parameters: the rate of H3+ destruction by electrons (e-), the
electron fraction, and the cosmic-ray ionization rate. Here we report a direct
experimental measurement of the H3+ destruction rate under nearly interstellar
conditions. We also report the observation of H3+ in a diffuse cloud (towards ζ Persei)
where the electron fraction is already known. From these, we find that the cosmic-ray
ionization rate along this line of sight is 40 times faster than previously assumed.
If such a high cosmic-ray flux is ubiquitous in diffuse clouds, the discrepancy
between chemical models and the previous observations5,6,7 of H3+ can be resolved.},

   line of the R(3, 3)(l) transition arising from the metastable (J, K) =
   (3, 3) state has been tentatively detected for the first time in the
   interstellar medium, where previous observations of H-3(+) had been
   limited to absorption lines from the lowest levels: (J, K) = (1, 0) of
   ortho-H-3(+) and (1, 1) of para-H-3(+).
   The H-3(+) absorption toward the Galactic center takes place in dense
   and diffuse clouds along the line of sight as well as the molecular
   complex close to the Galactic nucleus. At least four kinematic
   components are found in the H-3(+) absorption lines. We suggest
   identifications of the velocity components with those of H I, CO, and
   H2CO previously reported from radio and infrared observations. H I
   components with velocities that match those of weak and sharp CO and
   H2CO lines are attributed to diffuse clouds. Our observation has
   revealed a striking difference between the absorption profiles of H-3(+)
   and CO, demonstrating that the spectroscopy of H-3(+) provides
   information complementary to that obtained from CO spectroscopy.
   The tentative detection of the R(3, 3)(l) line and the non-detection of
   spectral lines from other J > 1 levels provide observational evidence
   for the metastability of the (3, 3) level, which is theoretically
   expected. This suggests that other metastable J = K levels with higher J
   may also be populated.},

two-body predissociation into H+H 2 (v, J), and photoemission to the H 3 ground
state surface with subsequent two-body decay are competing channels. In the case
of two-body predissociation, we determine the rovibrational population in the
H 2 (v, J) fragment. The vibrational distribution of H 2 is compared with approximate
theoretical predictions. For three-body decay, we measure the six-fold differential
photodissociation cross-section. To determine accurate final state distributions,
the geometric collection efficiency of the apparatus is calculated by a Monte
Carlo simulation, and the raw data are corrected for apparatus efficiency. The
final state momentum distribution shows pronounced correlation patterns which
are characteristic for the dissociation mechanism. For a three-body decay process
with a discrete kinetic energy release we have developed a novel data reduction
procedure based on the detection of two fragments. The final state distribution
determined by this independent method agrees extremely well with that observed in
the triple-coincidence data. In addition, this method allows us to fully explore
the phase space of the final state and to determine the branching ratios between

assembling all of the data into a single source. We have reviewed all reported

them based on a comparison with recent theoretical calculations. We have also
developed a complete labeling scheme for all energy levels below 9000 cm-1, which
alleviates the confusion in assigning H3+ transitions that results from the
difficulty of labeling the rovibrational energy levels of a molecule with such
strong mixing. Our comprehensive linelist was then used to produce a set of 526

chemical reactions that have been theoretically anticipated by Quack [M. Quack,
Mol. Phys. 34, 477 (1997)]. The abundance ratio of ortho-H+3 (I=3/2) and para-H+3
(I=1/2), R=[o-H+3]/[p-H+3], has been measured from relative intensities of their
infrared spectral lines in hydrogen plasmas using para-H2 and normal-H2 (75% o-H2 and 25% p-H2).
The observed clear differences in the value of R between the p-H2 and n-H2 plasmas
demonstrate the spin memory of protons even after ion-neutral reactions, and thus
the existence of selection rules for spin modifications. Both positive column
discharges and hollow cathode discharges have been used to demonstrate the effect.
Experiments using pulsed plasmas have been conducted in the hollow cathode to minimize
the uncertainty due to long-term conversion between p-H2 and o-H2 and to study
the time dependence of the o-H+3 to p-H+3 ratio. The observed R(t) has been analyzed
using simultaneous rate equations assuming the nuclear spin branching ratios
calculated from Quack’s theory. In p-H2 plasmas, the electron impact ionization
followed by the ion-neutral reaction H+2+H2→H+3+H produces pure p-H+3, but the
subsequent reaction between p-H+3 and p-H2 scrambles protons. While the proton
hop reaction (rate constant kH) maintains the purity of p-H+3, the hydrogen exchange
reaction (rate constant kE) produces o-H+3 and acts as the gateway for nuclear
spin conversion. The value of R(t), therefore, depends critically on the ratio
of their reaction rates α=kH/kE. From observed values of R(t), the ratio has been
determined to be α=2.4. This is in approximate agreement with the value reported
by Gerlich using isotopic species.},

Journal = ApJS,
Year = {1997},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {339-387},
Abstract = {Photometric and spectroscopic observations of 110 cool white dwarf stars
   are presented and analyzed with state-of-the-art model atmosphere
   calculations appropriate for cool white dwarfs with pure hydrogen and
   pure helium, as well as mixed H/He compositions. High signal-to-noise
   spectroscopy reveals the presence of H alpha in 20 white dwarfs
   previously classified as DC stars, four of which are magnetic. Cool
   white dwarfs are shown to form a narrow sequence in both color-color and
   color-magnitude diagrams, with little evidence for separation between
   hydrogen- and helium-rich compositions in these diagrams. The observed
   energy distributions are obtained from a combination of both optical
   BVRI and infrared JHK photometric data and used to derive both the
   effective temperature and the atmospheric composition of each star.
   Stellar masses are also obtained for 60 white dwarfs with known
   trigonometric parallaxes. Some discrepancies between the observed energy
   distributions and those predicted by the model atmospheres are
   described. In particular, evidence for the presence of a UV opacity
   source in the coolest hydrogen-rich white dwarfs is interpreted in terms
   of a pseudo continuum opacity originating from the Lyman edge.
   The simultaneous analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic
   observations provides a detailed picture of the chemical composition of
   cool white dwarfs. Most cool white dwarfs have energy distributions that
   are well reproduced by either pure hydrogen or pure helium models, with
   little evidence for objects with mixed atmospheric compositions. We
   identify a peculiar class of non-DA star with T-eff > 6000 K whose
   energy distributions are well reproduced by pure hydrogen models but
   whose spectra do not show Ha. Our results reveal an inhomogeneous
   temperature distribution of hydrogen- and helium-rich white dwarfs, and
   in particular the presence of a non-DA gap in the range 5000 less than
   or similar to T-eff less than or similar to 6000 K. The chemical
   evolution of cool white dwarfs is discussed at length with respect to
   our findings. We show that no known physical mechanisms (e.g.,
   convective mixing, convective dredge-up, accretion from the interstellar
   medium) can account for the temperature distribution of hydrogen- and
   helium-rich white dwarfs. Possible new mechanisms that could explain our
   results are presented. We propose a mechanism by which hydrogen is
   accreted onto the surface of helium-rich white dwarfs while remaining
   spectroscopically invisible. Observational evidence that supports our
   hypothesis is discussed.
   Lower limits for the age of the local Galactic disk are obtained by
   determining the age of the oldest white dwarfs in our sample. Ages in
   the range 6.5-10 Gyr are derived from evolutionary models with various
   core compositions and helium envelope masses.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional variational calculations of bound and resonance
   spectra of the H-3(+) molecular ion for the total angular momentum J = 0
   are presented. All N-E + N-A1 + N-A2 = 2 x 604 + 358 + 256 bound states
   of the MBB PES and some N-H + N-A1 + N-A2 = 2 x 264 + 142 + 119
   resonances with widths Gamma < 100 cm(-1) are computed.
   Such calculations are very challenging due to (i) a very deep
   potential-energy well which gives rise to a high density of bound and
   resonance states and (ii) the floppiness of the H,+ molecular ion which
   leads to various numerical difficulties. The computation was done using
   the filter diagonalization method. Here a series of subspace
   diagonalizations is performed on a Hamiltonian with a complex absorbing
   potential, (H) over cap - <i(W)over cap>, represented in a relatively
   small adapted basis set. Each small basis set is obtained by acting with
   the ABC (absorbing boundary conditions) Green's function on an initial
   wavepacket, using the modified by ABC Chebyshev recursion polynomial
   expansion. The method is described in some detail. Additionally, we
   describe an efficient and simple procedure of using Jacobi coordinate
   DVR (discrete variable representation) for a floppy triatomic molecule
   resulting in a sparse Hamiltonian matrix with a small spectral range,
   which in particular, overcomes the slow convergence of iterative Krylov
   type methods. Comparison between the present version of the filter
   diagonalization and the Lanczos method is made.
   The level statistics of the H-3(+) bound and resonance states are
   analysed showing the strongly chaotic nature of the spectra, starting
   already at very moderate energies, caused by the extreme floppiness of
   the system. The widths of computed resonances fluctuate by orders of
   magnitude. At energies just above the dissociation threshold the
   resonances are essentially very narrow and isolated, but start to
   overlap very quickly as energy increases. The number of resonance states
   per effective decay channel is sufficient to carry out a statistical
   analysis of decay rates by fitting their distribution to the chi(2)
   distribution with nu(eff) degrees of freedom, where nu(eff) is the
   effective number of decay channels. The result of this analysis is
   however negative, suggesting that the concept of average width on which
   it is partially based is not correct when resonances are overlapping,
   and that more reliable statistical theories of the effective Hamiltonian
   must be developed for the barrierless reactions.},

present review discusses how to unravel such spectra through the use of theoretical

this class of techniques permits a quantitative prediction or reproduction of
experimental spectra for some of the more challenging atomic systems under investigation.
It is shown that multichannel spectroscopy marries the techniques of multichannel
quantum-defect theory to the eigenchannel R-matrix method (or related methods).
It has long been appreciated that multichannel quantum-defect theory can successfully
use a collision-theory framework to interpret enormously complicated Rydberg spectra.
However, the capabilities of multichannel quantum-defect theory have increased
dramatically during the past decade, through the development of nearly ab initio
methods for the calculation of the short-range scattering parameters that control
the interactions of closed and open channels. In this review, emphasis is given to
the alkaline-earth atoms, for which many different observables have been successfully
compared with experiment over broad ranges of energy and resolution. Applications
of the method to describe the photoionization spectra of more complex open-shell

Abstract = {The assigned infrared spectrum of the D-3(+) molecular ion is extended
   from 84 to 529 lines by three types of spectroscopic measurements on
   hollow-cathode electrical discharges through deuterium gas: (i) emission
   from a small hollow cathode, in which the D-3(+) lines were
   distinguished from the electronic transitions of D-2 by the pressure
   dependence of their intensities; (ii) absorption in the same hollow
   cathode with discharge amplitude modulation; and (iii) absorption in a
   larger hollow cathode cell with discharge amplitude modulation. The
   observed lines belong mainly to the upsilon(2)(1)-0 fundamental and its
   hot bands 2 upsilon(2)(0)-upsilon(2)(1), 2 upsilon(2)(2)-upsilon(2)(1)
   and upsilon(1) + upsilon(2)(1) - v(1) in the 1330-2530 cm(-1) region in
   experiments (i) and (ii), and to the first overtone band 2 upsilon(2)(2)
   - 0 in the 3160-4000 cm(-1) region in experiment (iii). The lines were
   assigned by means of calculations with a large vibration-rotation basis,
   using a Morse-based discrete variable representation for the vibrations.
   This method overcomes the convergence problems for the centrifugal terms
   in the effective Hamiltonian approach. Six coefficients in the
   Meyer-Botschwina-Burton ab initio potential were adjusted in order to
   fit these data with a standard deviation of 0.059 cm(-1).},

  From the fit the vibrational term values for the fundamental bands and some
  overtones of H+3, H2D+, HD+2, and D+3 were computed by means of the TRIATOM package
  of Tennyson and Miller. The computed frequencies are in better agreement with
  experiment (maximum error ∼0.5 cm−1) than those of all previous ab initio calculations

  beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation and to take care of the finite mass

Title = {{A general discrete variable method to calculate vibrational-energy
   levels of 3-atom and 4-atom molecules}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {8519-8541},
Abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
   levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation.  The
   method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
   of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
   iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
   vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
   as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions in each
   off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more than cn(f+1)
   multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates. Choosing a
   (potential optimized) discrete variable representation (DVR) in each
   dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal. The rate-determining
   step is now the multiplication of a vector by the kinetic energy matrix
   and c is effectively (with rare exceptions) at most two. The n(f+1)
   scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed second derivative operators.
   The method is directly applicable to any three-atom and any nonlinear
   four-atom molecule. We use a variety of coordinate systems (Jacobi,
   Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond), for which the total number of
   factorizable terms in the exact kinetic energy operator is never large,
   to calculate very well-converged band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1,
   of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1, and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying
   levels of H2O2. The results for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify
   the causes of discrepancies in published work. The product basis results
   in very large matrices (up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the
   cost is within an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis
   approaches using explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis
   approaches are molecule and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to
   apply the DVR-Lanczos method to all the examples presented here with a
   single computer program. The principal advantage of our method is thus
   its generality, and in this context it is efficient, with the cost
   scaling slowly with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

journal  = JCP,
year     = {1993},
volume   = {98},
pages    = {1073-1092},
abstract = {The infrared predissociation spectrum of the H3+ ion has attracted
considerable attention; theoretical models have been developed which account
for many of the observed features and which make further predictions. This paper
describes the results of experiments designed to test these predictions. The
spectrum is recorded by bringing a mass‐selected H3+ ion beam into parallel or
antiparallel coincidence with a cw carbon dioxide infrared laser beam. In the
earlier work, 27 000 lines were observed over the range 874–1094 cm−1, each line
being recorded by detecting H+ fragment ions produced by predissociation. The
spectrum varied according to the H+ kinetic energy window selected, and it was
proved that many of the lines arise from metastable states of H3+ lying above
the H2+H+ dissociation limit. The spectrum showed no immediately recognizable
pattern, but low resolution convolutions revealed the existence of a coarse‐grained
structure of four main peaks. The isotopic species H2D+ and D2H+ showed similarly
complex spectra which, however, differed depending on whether H+ or D+ fragments
were detected. The most important conclusion from subsequent theoretical models
is that the metastable states involved are in a region of classical chaos and
hence cannot be simply assigned in terms of vibrational modes. However, the
coarse‐grained spectrum is associated with the remnants of a periodic orbit in
which quasilinear H3+ undergoes a large amplitude bending motion.
Rotational angular momentum barriers lead to trapping of these essentially regular
states, which are embedded in a classically chaotic manifold. Semiclassical
trajectory studies and three‐dimensional quantum mechanical calculations are
consistent with each other. Our present experimental methods are described and
questions concerning reproducibility are addressed. We describe new measurements
over the range 964–992 cm−1 spanning the position of one of the peaks observed
earlier in the convoluted spectrum. The H3+ spectrum is recorded for a series of
different H+ kinetic energy windows and the results are summarized in bar charts.
Convolutions of the data recorded for H+ ions with very small center‐of‐mass kinetic
energies are consistent with the earlier results and with theoretical predictions,
but also reveal additional structure. Convolutions for large H+ kinetic energies
(≥500 cm−1) reveal less evidence of characteristic structure. Measurements over
the region 1025–1045 cm−1 are also described; they are only for very small H+
kinetic energy release, but the linewidths are also tabulated. Most of the metastable
states of H3+ predissociate predominantly through a single channel, but examples
of multiple dissociation channels have also been recorded. Direct measurements
of some predissociation lifetimes are presented. Selected regions of the spectra
of D2H+ and H2D+, measured by recording H+ and D+ fragments separately with kinetic
energy windows from 0 to 3000 cm−1, are described. The results are in excellent
agreement with theoretical predictions, as also are measurements of the background
spontaneous predissociation.},

Abstract = {Protonated hydrogen, H-3+, composed of three protons and two electrons,

   its discovery by J. J. Thomson in 1912, but its first spectrum was
   observed only in 1980. The infrared spectrum has since been extended to
   higher vibrational and rotational states. The existence of a large
   amount of H-3+ in Nature was first demonstrated in the serendipitous
   discovery of its infrared emission bands in the polar auroral regions of
   the Jupiter ionosphere. The spectrum is extremely intense and pure and
   can be used to monitor the morphology and temporal variation of the
   dynamic Jovian plasmas. Early this year, an identification of H-3+
   emission was claimed in Supernova 1987A. In April strong H-3+ infrared

abstract = {The Heidelberg heavy ion test storage ring TSR started operation in
May 1988. The lifetimes of the ion beams observed in the first experiments can
be explained by interactions with the residual gas. Multiple Coulomb scattering,
single Coulomb scattering, electron capture and electron stripping are the
relevant processes. Electron cooling of ions as heavy as O8+ has been observed
for the first time. With increasing particle number, the longitudinal Schottky
noise spectrum becomes dominated by collective waves for cooled beams, allowing
a determination of velocities of sound. After correcting for these coherent distortions
fo the Schottky spectrum, the longitudinal beam temperature could be extracted.
The observed longitudinal equilibrium beam temperatures increase strongly with
the charge of the ions. For a cooled C6+ beam, temperatures a factor of 120 higher
were measured compared to a proton beam with the same particle number. The shrinking
of the beam diameter due to electron cooling was observed with detectors which
measured the profile of charge-changed ions behind a bending magnet. A strong
laser-induced fluorescence was detected when storing metastable 7Li+ ions in the
ring. Via the Doppler effect a very accurate measurement of the ion velocity
profile could be performed. First attempts to observe laser cooling failed, probably
due to heating effects from intrabeam scattering and a coupling between longitudinal
and transversal motion in the beam. Several experiments under preparation are outlined.},

   at a potential of from 1.2 to 10.5 kV is aligned to be collinear with an infrared
   laser beam from a carbon dioxide cw laser. Photodissociation occurs to produce
   fragment H+ ions which are separated from the parent H+3 ions using an electrostatic
   analyzer. Doppler tuning is accomplished by scanning the H+3 ion beam potential
   and resonance lines corresponding to an increase in fragment H+ ion current are

   with a wide range of lifetimes exist. The vibration‐rotation levels of the H2⋅⋅⋅H+
   system are discussed in terms of the theoretical models which have been developed
   for van der Waals complexes and semiquantitative calculations using an ab initio
   H2⋅⋅⋅H+ interaction potential are described. Measurements of the H+ center‐of‐mass
   kinetic energy associated with individual resonance lines are described; they
   provide information about the energy of the predissociating H+3 level relative
   to its H2+H+ dissociation channel. Many of the resonance lines are associated
   with a relatively small energy release (10–500 cm−1), but energy releases of
   over 3500 cm−1 are also observed, which must arise from transitions between pairs
   of levels, both of which lie well above the lowest dissociation limit. This large
   energy release is almost certainly due to vibrational predissociation, while the
   smaller energy releases are associated either with rotational predissociation or
   tunnelling through a centrifugal barrier. Preliminary observations of similarly
   complex predissociation spectra of D+3, D2H+, and DH+2 have been made. A striking
   result is that spectra of D2H+ detected by monitoring either H+ or D+ photofragment
   ions are different. The results described have important implications for studies
   of reactive scattering processes and for our understanding of the potential energy
   surfaces for polyatomic molecules.},

   constants are evaluated, including the vibrational dependence of the quartic
   centrifugal and Coriolis constants. The inertial and centrifugal planarity defects
   are proportional to (V2 + 1). To a good approximation, the energies are diagonal
   in the quantum number G = |k − l2| and are given by a secular equation of dimension
   (V2 + 1) or lower. Explicit rotational energy level formulas are given for the
   vibrational states with any value of V1 and with V2 = 0 or 1.},

abstract = {A technique is described, that allows the measurement of integral
cross sections for ion-molecule reactions and electron-transfer processes in the
energy range from typically 0.1 to 20 eV (lab). Basically similar to the tandem
mass spectrometer method, it uses inhomogeneous oscillatory electric fields for
the storage and guidance of the primary ions and for the collection of the secondary
ions. By these means a reduction of the number of excited ions in the primary beam
and a good definition of the kinetic energy are obtained, together with a collection
and detection probability for the secondary ions, that approaches unity for all
scattering angles in a broad energy band. Tire ion beam intensity (105 to 107 ions
per second) is only weakly dependent on the kinetic energy down to typically 0.15 eV (lab).
The distribution of the collision energies is mainly determined by the thermal
motion of the reactant gas in the scattering chamber (T ≈ 300 K). Measurements
are reported for the reactions Ar+ + D2 → ArD+ + D and Ne+ + CO → C+ Ne+O.},
