Abstract = {Soft chemical ionization mass spectrometry techniques, particularly the
   well-established proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, PTR-MS, and
   selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry, SIFT-MS, are widely used for
   real-time quantification of volatile organic compounds in ambient air
   and exhaled breath with applications ranging from environmental science
   to medicine. The most common reagent ions H3O+, NO+, or O-2(+center dot)
   can be selected either by quadrupole mass filtering from a discharge ion
   source, which is relatively inefficient, or by switching the gas/vapor
   in the ion source, which is relatively slow. The chosen reagent ions are
   introduced into a flow tube or flow-drift tube reactor where they react
   with analyte molecules in sample gas. This article describes a new
   electrostatic reagent ion switching, ERIS, technique by which H3O+, NO+,
   and O-2(+center dot) reagent ions, produced simultaneously in three
   separate gas discharges, can be purified in post-discharge source drift
   tubes, switched rapidly, and selected for transport into a flow-drift
   tube reactor. The construction of the device and the ion molecule
   chemistry exploited to purify the individual reagent ions are described.
   The speed and sensitivity of ERIS coupled to a selected ion flow drift
   tube mass spectrometry, SIFDT-MS, is demonstrated by the simultaneous
   quantification of methanol with H3O+, acetone with NO+, and dimethyl
   sulfide with O-2(+center dot) reagent ions in single breath exhalations.
   The present ERIS approach is shown to be preferable to the previously
   used quadrupole filtering, as it increases analytical sensitivity of the
   SIFDT-MS instrument while reducing its size and the required number of
   vacuum pumps.},

Title = {{Production of Hydronium Ion (H3O)(+) and Protonated Water Clusters
(H2O)(n)H+ after Energetic Ion Bombardment of Water Ice in Astrophysical Environments}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {123},

Pages = {8001-8008},
Abstract = {Water ice exists on many objects in space. The most abundant icy
   species, among them water, are present in the icy satellites of the
   outer Solar System giant planets. The nuclei of comets, which are mainly
   composed of water ice, give another example of its abundance. In the
   interstellar medium (ISM), ice mantles, formed by molecular species
   sticking on dust grains, consist mainly of water ice. All these objects
   are exposed to ionizing radiation like ions, UV photons, and electrons.
   Sputtering of atoms, molecules, ions, and radicals from icy surfaces may
   populate and maintain exospheres of icy objects in the Solar System. In
   other respects, ionized hydrides such as OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ have been
   detected in the gas phase in star-forming regions. Interactions with
   cosmic rays could be an additional explanation to the current models for
   the formation of those species. In fact, laboratory simulations showed
   that the main components of the sputtered ionic species from water ice
   are oxygen hydrides. In this work, water ice targets were irradiated at
   several temperatures (10-200 K) by 90 keV O6+ ions, yielding an
   electronic stopping power of about 12 eV/angstrom, when the nuclear
   stopping power is comparable to the electronic stopping power.
   Sputtering of secondary ions after bombardment of the ice target was
   analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Besides
   hydrogen ions (H+, H-2(+), H-3(+)), also O+, O2+, OH+, (H2O)(+), and
   clusters of (H2O)(n)H+ with n = 1-8 are emitted. Our results show a
   progressive yield decrease with increasing temperature of all of the
   detected species. This is related to the structure of the ice: the ionic
   sputtering yield for crystalline ice is much lower than for an amorphous
   ice. For instance, amorphous ice at 10 K exhibits a yield of the order
   of 2 x 10(-6) secondary (H2O)(n)H+ hydride ions/projectile (with n =
   1-8). As the temperature is increasing toward the phase transition to
   crystalline ice, the yields decrease by about one order of magnitude.},

Title = {{Evidence of the Key Role of H3O+ in Phospholipid Membrane Morphology}},
Journal = {Langmuir},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {10725-10734},
Abstract = {This study explains the importance of the phosphate moiety and H3O+ in
   controlling the ionic flux through phospholipid membranes. We show that
   despite an increase in the H3O+. concentration when the pH is decreased,
   the level of ionic conduction through phospholipid bilayers is reduced.
   By modifying the lipid structure, we show the dominant determinant of
   membrane conduction is the hydrogen bonding between the phosphate
   oxygens on adjacent phospholipids: The modulation of conduction with pH
   is proposed to arise from the varying H3O+ concentrations altering the
   molecular area per lipid and modifying, the geometry of conductive
   defects already present in the membrane. Given the geometrical
   constraints that control the lipid phase structure of membranes, these,
   area changes predict that organisms evolving in environments with
   different pHs will select for different phospholipid chain lengths, as
   is found for organisms near highly acidic volcanic vents (short chains)
   or in highly alkaline salt lakes (long chains). The stabilizing effect
   of the hydration shells around phosphate groups also accounts for the
   prevalence of phospholipids across biology. Measurement of ion
   permeation through lipid bilayers was made tractable using sparsely
   tethered bilayer lipid membranes with-swept frequency electrical
   impedance spectroscopy and ramped dc amperometry. Additional evidence of
   the effect of a change, in pH on lipid packing density is obtained from
   neutron reflectometry data of tethered membranes containing
   perdeuterated lipids.},

   Representation of the Hydrated Proton?}},
Journal = JCTC,

Volume = {12},
Pages = {5284-5292},
Abstract = {We report a new potential energy surface (PES) for hydronium that
   dissociates to H+ + H2O. The PES is a permutationally invariant fit to a
   data set of nearly 100,000 electronic energies, of which most are
   CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVQZ, plus a small set of MRCI-aug-cc-pVTZ diabatic
   energies in the region where the CCSD(T) method fails. The long-range
   part of the PES is described accurately by a classical Coulomb
   interaction between the proton and H2O using partial charges obtained
   from an accurate, full-dimensional dipole moment surface. A switching
   function connects the fitted PES to this long-range interaction.The
   fidelity of this global PES is determined by a combination of standard
   geometry and harmonic analyses at the minimum and inversion saddle
   point. In addition, VSCF/VCI calculations of the fundamentals and
   tunneling splittings are reported; all of these are within 3 cm(-1) or
   less of experimental values. A diffusion Monte Carlo calculation is also
   reported for the zero-point state. The PES is used in a two-body
   representation of the interaction of the proton with two water
   molecules, including a 2-body H2O-H2O interaction, and is shown to give
   a realistic description of the Zundel cation H5O2+. This demonstrates
   that the PES may be usable as a component in a many-body potential
   describing the hydrated proton, especially for vibrational calculations
   of protonated water clusters.},

We considered six key vibrational normal modes{,} namely: a hindered rotation{,}
two H–O–H bends{,} and three O–H stretches. Between the O–H stretches and the H–O–H
bends{,} the first is more sensitive to solvation strength. Our calculations revealed
that the Fermi resonance between the first overtones of O–H bends and the fundamentals
of O–H stretches led to complex spectral features from 3000 to 3500 cm-1. Such
an interaction is not only sensitive to the type of rare gas messengers surrounding
the H3O+ ion{,} it also exhibits an anomalous H -> D isotope effect. Although it
is accepted that visible combination tones (1900 cm-1) arise from the complex
coupling between the hindered rotation and the H–O–H bends{,} the origin of their
intensities is not yet clearly understood. We found that the intensity of these
combination tones could be much stronger than their fundamental H–O–H bends. Within
our theoretical framework{,} we tracked the combination tone{'}s intensity back to
the asymmetric O–H stretches. This simple notion of intensity borrowing is confirmed
by examining eight complexes (H3O+·Rg3 and D3O+·Rg3) with spectral features awaiting

abstract = {In diffuse interstellar clouds the chemistry that leads to the formation
of the oxygen-bearing ions OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ begins with the ionization of atomic
hydrogen by cosmic rays, and continues through subsequent hydrogen abstraction
reactions involving H2. Given these reaction pathways, the observed abundances
of these molecules are useful in constraining both the total cosmic-ray ionization
rate of atomic hydrogen (H) and molecular hydrogen fraction (). We present observations
targeting transitions of OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ made with the Herschel Space Observatory
along 20 Galactic sight lines toward bright submillimeter continuum sources.
Both OH+ and H2O+ are detected in absorption in multiple velocity components
along every sight line, but H3O+ is only detected along 7 sight lines. From the
molecular abundances we compute  in multiple distinct components along each line
of sight, and find a Gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviation 0.042 ± 0.018.
This confirms previous findings that OH+ and H2O+ primarily reside in gas with
low H2 fractions. We also infer H throughout our sample, and find a lognormal
distribution with mean log (H) = –15.75 (H = 1.78  10–16 s–1) and standard deviation 0.29
for gas within the Galactic disk, but outside of the Galactic center. This is in
good agreement with the mean and distribution of cosmic-ray ionization rates previously
inferred from H observations. Ionization rates in the Galactic center tend to
be 10-100 times larger than found in the Galactic disk, also in accord with prior studies.},

Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {8362-8372},
Abstract = {The infrared laser direct absorption spectrum of H2DO+ in the OH
   stretching region was reported quite recently revealing large amplitude
   tunneling dynamics. The large rotational constants make the jet-cooled
   spectrum relatively sparse at low rotational temperatures and
   assignments thus challenging. Transitions were assigned through ground
   state combination differences, with additional tentative assignments
   made via comparison of predicted/observed spectra. More recently, 9
   rotation-inversion transitions were recorded in the sub-millimeter
   (sub-mm) region, which yielded tunneling splittings and rotational
   constants differing slightly from IR results. This has prompted the
   present reinvestigation of the H2DO+ spectra, which now takes full
   advantage of the combined data from both studies. While previous
   analyses considered each tunneling state as independent and
   non-interacting, the present analysis is based on a
   tunneling-Hamiltonian model for the well studied, isoelectronic NH2D
   molecule, modified to account for the larger tunneling splitting. The
   combined analysis revealed rotational interaction between tunneling
   states as well as between the two OH stretching modes and permitted a
   substantial number of new assignments to be made, including one
   sub-millimeter transition while only few IR assignments had to be
   corrected or omitted. It leads to improvement in parameters for both the
   ground as well as for the OH stretching states of this important
   molecular ion, which reproduce the assigned lines within experimental
   uncertainties, provides guidance, e. g., for the spectral search in the
   OD stretch region, and yields deeper insight into the tunneling dynamics.},

   and assignment of the relatively weak band (nu(-)(1)<- 0(+)) that
   crosses the inversion tunneling gap, which is optically forbidden in

Abstract = {New potential energy surfaces are calculated for the hydronium ion using

   especially for the inversion part of the full surface. Electronic
   energies obtained with different correlation consistent basis sets are
   extrapolated to the infinite basis set limit. Core-valence and first
   order relativistic effects are also included. The influence of these two
   contributions and basis set sizes on both the inversion barrier height
   and equilibrium geometry are investigated thoroughly. The same methods
   are also adopted for ammonia in order to further improve a recently
   published surface {[}J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6358 (2003)]. The vibrational
   eigenvalues are calculated variationally both for the symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers using exact six-dimensional kinetic energy
   operators and successive basis set contractions. With the new surfaces,
   the mean absolute deviations obtained for all experimentally observed

   real values. The value for ammonia is also close to the height
   determined from published experimental data in our previous work. The
   lowest energies for the high-frequency modes are computed with the mean
   absolute deviation being less than 2 cm(-1) for isotopomers of H(3)O(+)

Abstract = {The maps presented in Paper I are here used to infer the variation of
   the column densities of HCO+, DCO+, N2H+, and N2D+ as a function of
   distance from the dust peak. These results are interpreted with the aid
   of a crude chemical model that predicts the abundances of these species
   as a function of radius in a spherically symmetric model with radial
   density distribution inferred from the observations of dust emission at
   millimeter wavelengths and dust absorption in the infrared. Our main
   observational finding is that the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) column density ratio
   is of order 0.2 toward the L1544 dust peak as compared to
   N(DCO+)/N(HCO+) = 0.04. We conclude that this result, as well as the
   general finding that N2H+ and N2D+ correlate well with the dust, is
   caused by CO being depleted to a much higher degree than molecular
   nitrogen in the high-density core of L1544. Depletion also favors
   deuterium enhancement, and thus N2D+, which traces the dense and highly
   CO-depleted core nucleus, is much more enhanced than DCO+. Our models do
   not uniquely define the chemistry in the high-density depleted nucleus
   of L1544, but they do suggest that the ionization degree is a few times
   10(-9) and that the ambipolar diffusion timescale is locally similar to
   the free-fall time. It seems likely that the lower limit, which one
   obtains to ionization degree by summing all observable molecular ions,
   is not a great underestimate of the true ionization degree. We predict
   that atomic oxygen is abundant in the dense core and, if so, H3O+ may be
   the main ion in the central highly depleted region of the core.},

Abstract = {The vibrational relaxation of H-3(+) molecules from a conventional
   plasma ion source is studied performing Coulomb explosion imaging on the
   ions extracted from a storage ring after variable times of storage.
   Storage for 2 s is found sufficient for radiative relaxation of the
   breathing excitation and the fragment velocity distribution in the
   breathing coordinate then agrees well with simulations based on the
   calculated ground-state wave function. The radiative decay of the two
   lowest pure breathing levels (1,0(0)) and (2,0(0)) is seen to be
   considerably faster than expected from rotationless calculations.
   Assuming a high rotational excitation of the H-3(+) ions, as suggested
   already in earlier experiments, the theoretical transition probabilities
   of the University College London line list for H-3(+) [L. Neale, S.
   Miller, and J. Tennyson, Astrophys. J. 464, 516 (1996)] can explain the
   increase of the vibrational cooling rates and reproduce the observed
   decay curve for the lowest breathing-excited level, confirming the
   absolute transition probabilities of these line tables. The observations
   give evidence for a quasistable population of high-lying rotational
   levels in the stored ion beam, relevant for the interpretation of

   densities are calculated to show central holes of radius 7000 and 4000
   AU, respectively, while the column density of N(2)H(+) is centrally
   peaked. These predictions are consistent with observations of L1544. If
   the dynamical timescale of the core is larger than that of the
   Larson-Penston solution owing to magnetic fields, rotation, or
   turbulence, the column densities of CO and CCS are smaller, and their
   holes are larger than in the Larson-Penston core with the same central
   gas density. On the other hand, N(2)H(+) and NH(3) are more abundant in
   the more slowly collapsing core. Therefore, molecular distributions can
   probe the collapse timescale of prestellar cores. Deuterium
   fractionation has also been studied via numerical calculations. The
   deuterium fraction in molecules increases as a core evolves and
   molecular depletion onto grains proceeds. When the central density of
   the core is n(H) = 3 x 10(6) cm(-3), the ratio DCO(+)/HCO(+) at the
   center is in the range 0.06-0.27, depending on the collapse timescale
   and adsorption energy; this range is in reasonable agreement with the
   observed value in L1544.},

Abstract = {We report the first far-infrared detection of the hydronium ion (H3O+)
   toward the Sagittarius B2 molecular cloud, near the Galactic center.
   Using the Infrared Space Observatory Long-Wavelength Spectrometer, we
   have detected three lines arising from the nu (2) ground-state inversion
   mode (0(+)-->0(-)) at 55.3 cm(-1). All transitions are observed in
   absorption against the optically thick infrared continuum emission of
   the dust. Two different absorption regions can be distinguished, the
   H3O+ associated with the Sgr B2 extended envelope and that of foreground
   gas along the line of sight. The derived abundances for both components
   are rather similar, less than or similar to1 x 10(-9), and may explain
   the high water abundance found in the low-density gas toward Sgr B2 as
   its dissociative recombination leads to the formation of important
   molecules OH and H2O. Contribution of the Q(1, 1) line of para-H3O+ to
   the 2(12)-1(01) line of (H2O)-O-18 is also analyzed. This allows a
   better determination of water abundance from far-infrared observations.
   The corrected H2O abundances are less than or equal to 10(-6) for the
   diffuse clouds along the line of sight and a few times 10(-6) for the
   gas associated with the Sgr B2 envelope, in good agreement with water
   vapor observations from the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite.},

Abstract = {Dissociative recombination of the polyatomic ions D3O+ and H3O+ with
   electrons have been studied at the heavy-ion storage ring CRYRING (Manne
   Siegbahn Laboratory, Stockholm University). Absolute cross sections have
   been determined from 0.001 eV to 0.25 eV center-of-mass energy for D3O+
   and from 0.001 eV to 28 eV for H3O+. The cross sections are large
   (7.3x10(-13) cm(2) for D3O+ and 3.3x10(-12) cm(2) for H3O+ at 0.001 eV).
   At low energies, the cross sections for D3O+ are E-1 energy dependent
   whereas it is slightly steeper for H3O+. A similar E-1 energy dependence
   was also observed by Mul {[}J. Phys. B 16, 3099 (1983)] with a merged
   electron-ion beam technique for both H3O+ and D3O+ and by
   Vejby-Christensen {[}Astrophys. J. 483, 531 (1997)] with the ASTRID
   storage ring in Denmark, who presented relative cross sections for H3O+.
   A resonance has been observed around 11 eV for H3O+. It reflects an
   electron capture to Rydberg states converging to an excited ionic core.
   A similar structure was reported by Vejby-Christensen Our absolute
   measurements are in fairly good agreement with those from Mul , which
   were first divided by 2 (Mitchell, 1999, private communication) and from
   Heppner {[}Phys. Rev. A 13, 1000 (1976)] for H3O+. Thermal rates were
   deduced from the measured cross sections for electron temperatures
   ranging from 50 K to 30 000 K. At 300 K, the thermal rate is equal to
   7.6x10(-7) cm(3) s(-1) for H3O+ and to 3.5x10(-7) cm(3) s(-1) for D3O+.
   Complete branching ratios for all the possible product channels have
   been determined from 0 eV to 0.005 eV center-of-mass energy for D3O+ and
   at 0 eV for H3O+, using a well-characterized transmission grid in front
   of an energy-sensitive surface-barrier detector. No isotope effect was
   observed within the experimental uncertainties. The three-body break-up
   channel OX+X+X (where X stands for H or D) is found to occur for
   67\%-70\% of the dissociations. Water or heavy water is produced with an
   18\%-17\% probability and the production of oxygen atoms is negligible.
   These results support the three-body break-up dominance already found by
   Vejby-Christensen for the DR of H3O+ in a similar heavy-ion storage ring
   experiment. However, even if the general trend is the same for both
   storage rings, significant differences have been observed and will be
   discussed.},

   surface points is carried out using the correlation corrected
   vibrational self-consistent field (CC-VSCF) method. This method includes
   anharmonicity and the coupling between different vibrational modes. The
   combined electronic structure/vibrational algorithm thus provides
   first-principles calculations of vibrational spectroscopy at a fairly

   In the cases of (H(2)O)(3) and H(2)O-CH(3)OH, over 13 000 potential
   surface points are computed. For each system treated, all the
   fundamental transitions are computed, but the experimental data for
   comparison is mostly available for the OH stretches or other stiff modes
   only. The results show very good agreement between the calculated and
   experimental frequencies for all systems. The typical deviation for OH
   stretching modes is on the order of 50 cm(-1), indicating that the ab
   initio potential surfaces are of good accuracy. This is very encouraging
   for further pursuing MP2 calculations of potential energy surfaces of

   Inclusion of Delta k = +/-3n interactions in the Hamiltonian was

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {1992},

Pages = {533-550},
Abstract = {We present an interstellar medium study of the three reasonably
   accessible low-lying submillimeter lines of the H3O+ molecular ion at
   396, 364, and 307 GHz. Emission at the frequencies of the latter two
   lines has previously been reported, but only from the spectroscopically
   confused regions Orion/KL and SgrB2. This work reports the first study
   of the 396 GHz line and, possibly more significantly, the detection of
   H3O+ lines in less confused regions. In particular, there is a clear
   detection of H3O+ in the W3 IRS 5 cloud where, in the case of the 396
   GHz line at least, no other spectral features are visible in the
   observing band.
   An analysis of the H3O+ line ratios shows that under high-density
   (n(H-2) almost-equal-to 10(6)-10(7) cm-3), high-temperature conditions
   (T(kin) greater than or similar to 50 K), the 396 GHz line is about a
   factor of 2 stronger than the 364 GHz line, with the 307 GHz line much
   weaker, in agreement with the observations on sources such as W3 IRS 5,
   Orion/KL, and G34.3 + 0.15. However, for lower densities, the excitation
   of the 364 GHz line can be very sensitive to dust radiation pumping and
   it is shown that this seems to be the case in Sgr B2, resulting in the
   364 GHz line being a factor of 2-3 stronger than the 396 GHz line. Under
   almost all conditions the 307 GHz line will be weak, the exception being
   for densities n(H-2) greater than or similar to 10(7) CM-3.
   H3O+ is an important molecular ion, intimately involved in the chemistry
   of oxygen and water. The fractional interstellar abundance, x(H3O+), is
   shown to be typically in the range from 1 x 10(-10) to 3 x 10(-9), in
   agreement with, or slightly below the theoretical values of (1-4) x
   10(-9). From a simple chemical model we show that if H3O+ is the main
   precursor Of 02 and H2O, x(H2O) almost-equal-to 10(3) x(H3O+) and X(O2)
   almost-equal-to 10(4) x (H3O+), SO providing order-of-magnitude
   predictions of the H2O and O2 abundances for the clouds observed in
   H3O+. The predicted X(O2) almost-equal-to 10(-6)-10(-5) are close to the
   measured upper limits for 02. The estimated water abundances, x(H2O)
   almost-equal-to 10(-7)-10(-6), are somewhat lower than those derived
   from other observations and suggest that additional processes may play a
   role in the water production. A possible mechanism is grain surface
   formation of H2O followed by release back into the gas phase when the
   grains are heated to sufficiently high temperatures by radiation from
   newly-formed stars.},
