Journal =MP,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {1873-1883},
Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models are investigated,
   which help to understand the unusual rovibrational energy-level
   structure of the astronomically relevant and chemically interesting
   astructural molecular ion H-5(+). Due to the very low hindering barrier
   characterising the 1D torsion-only vibrational model of H-5(+), this
   model yields strongly divergent energy levels. The results obtained
   using a realistic model for the torsion potential, including the
   computed (near) degeneracies, can be rationalised in terms of the model
   with no barrier. Coupling of the torsional motion with a single
   rotational degree of freedom is also investigated in detail. It is shown
   how the embedding-dependent rovibrational models yield energy levels
   that can be rationalised via the 2D vibrational model containing two
   independent torsions. Insight into the complex rovibrational energy
   level structure of the models and of H-5(+) is gained via variational
   nuclear motion and diffusion Monte Carlo computations and by the
   analysis of the wavefunctions they provide. The modelling results
   describing the transition from the zero barrier limit to the large
   barrier limit should prove to be useful for the important class of
   molecules and molecular ions that contain two weakly coupled internal
   rotors.}},

Pages = {11725-11736},
Abstract = {{The results of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations of the ground
   and selected excited states of H-5(+) and its deuterated analogues are
   presented. Comparisons are made between the results obtained from two
   recently reported potential surfaces. Both of these surfaces are based
   on CCSD(T) electronic energies, but the fits display substantial
   differences in the energies of low-lying stationary points. Little
   sensitivity to these features is found in the DMC results, which yield
   zero-point energies based on the two surfaces that differ by between 20
   and 30 cm(-1) for all twelve isotopologues of H-5(+). Likewise,
   projections of the ground state probability amplitudes, evaluated for
   the two surfaces, are virtually identical. By using the ground state
   probability amplitudes, vibrationally averaged rotational constants and
   dipole moments were calculated. On the basis of these calculations, all
   isotopologues are shown to be near-prolate symmetric tops. Further, in
   cases where the ion had a nonzero dipole moment, the magnitude of the
   vibrationally averaged dipole moment was found to range from 0.33 to
   1.15 D, which is comparable to the dipole moments of H2D+ and HD2+.
   Excited states with up to three quanta in the shared proton stretch and
   one quantum in the in-phase stretch of the outer H-2 groups were also
   investigated. Trends in the energies and the properties of these states
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced dimensional quantum dynamics calculations of the infrared
   spectrum of the H-5(+) and D-5(+) clusters are reported in both low,
   300-2200 cm(-1), and high, 2400-4500 cm(-1), energy regions. The
   proposed four-dimensional quantum model describes the motion of the
   proton between the two vibrating hydrogen molecules. The simulations are
   performed using time-dependent and time-independent approaches within
   the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method. Propagation of the
   wavepackets includes an absorbing scheme to deal with vibrational
   dissociating states, and to assign the different spectral lines, block
   improved relaxation computations are performed for both bound and
   predissociative vibrational states of the systems. The reported
   computations make use of an analytical ab initio-based potential energy,
   and ``on the fly{''} DFT dipole moment surfaces. The predominant
   features in the spectra are assigned to the excitations of the
   shared-proton stretch mode, and above dissociation the symmetric and
   antisymmetric stretching of the two H-2 and the breathing mode of H-3(+)
   are also involved. The computed infrared absorption spectra for both
   cations are in very good agreement with the recent experimental
   measurements available from multiple-photon dissociation and
   mass-selected single-photon photodissociation spectroscopy techniques.
   Comparison of the present results with previous theoretical calculations
   on these systems is also presented. Such comparisons between different
   theoretical approaches and experimental measurements can serve to
   evaluate the approximations employed, and to guide higher-order

Abstract = {{H-5(+) is the smallest proton-bound dimer. As such, its potential energy
   surface and spectroscopy are highly complex, with extreme anharmonicity
   and vibrational state mixing; this system provides an important
   benchmark for modern theoretical methods. Unfortunately, previous
   measurements covered only the higher-frequency region of the infrared
   spectrum. Here, spectra for H-5(+) and D-5(+) are extended to the mid-
   and far-IR, where the fundamental of the proton stretch and its
   combinations with other low-frequency vibrations are expected. Ions in a
   supersonic molecular beam are mass-selected and studied with
   multiple-photon dissociation spectroscopy using the FELIX free electron
   laser. A transition at 379 cm(-1) is assigned tentatively to the
   fundamental of the proton stretch of H-5(+), and bands throughout the
   300-2200 cm(-1) region are assigned to combinations of this mode with
   bending and torsional vibrations. Coupled vibrational calculations,
   using ab initio potential and dipole moment surfaces, account for the

Title = {{A new accurate and full dimensional potential energy surface of H-5(+)
   based on a triatomics-in-molecules analytic functional form}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{133}},
Abstract = {{In this work a reliable full nine-dimensional potential energy surface
   for studying the dynamics of H-5(+) is constructed, which is completely
   symmetric under any permutation of the nuclei. For this purpose, we
   develop a triatoms-in-molecules method as an extension of the more
   common diatoms-in-molecules one, which allows a very accurate
   description of the asymptotic regions by including correctly the
   charge-induced dipole and quadrupole interactions. Moreover, this
   treatment provides a semiquantitative description of all the topological
   features of the global potential compared with coupled cluster results.
   In particular, the hop of the proton between two H-2 fragments produces
   a double well in the potential. This resonant structure involving the
   five atoms produces a stabilization, lowering the barrier, and the
   triatoms-in-molecules yields to a barrier significantly higher than the
   ab initio results. Therefore, to improve the triatomics-in-molecules
   potential surface, two five-body terms are added, which are fitted to
   more than 110 000 coupled-cluster ab initio points. The global potential
   energy surface thus obtained in this work has an overall root mean
   square error of 0.079 kcal/mol for energies below 27 kcal/mol above the
   global well. The features of the potential are described and compared
   with previous available surfaces. }},

Title = {{Interpretation of the vibrational energy level structure of the

Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Abstract = {{Variational nuclear motion computations, employing an exact kinetic
   energy operator and two different potential energy surfaces, are
   performed to study the first 60 vibrational states of the molecular ion
   H-5(+)  {[}H-2-H-H-2](+) and all of its deuterated isotopologues and
   isotopomers, altogether 12 species. Detailed investigation of the
   vibrational wavefunctions mostly results in physically intuitive labels
   not only for the fundamentals but also for the overtone and combination
   states computed. The torsional motion associated with the left and right
   diatomics appears to be well separated from the other vibrational
   degrees of freedom for all species. The unusual structure of the
   higher-lying bending states and the heavy mixing of the internal motions
   is partly due to the astructural character of all these molecular ions.
   The existence of distinct isotopomers in the H5-nDn+, n = 1-4 cases, in
   the energy range studied, is confirmed. Two rules determine the
   stability order of the isotopomers: first, when possible, H prefers to
   stay in the middle of the ions rather than at the sides, and, second,
   the isotopomer with a homonuclear diatomic at the side is always lower
   in energy. The large number of precise vibrational energies of the
   present study, as well as the detailed assignment of the states, should
   serve as benchmarks for future studies by more approximate
   nuclear-motion treatments, such as diffusion Monte Carlo and
   multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree. }},
