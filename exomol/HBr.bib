Abstract = {Introduction The electronic structure of the HBr molecule was
   investigated with particular attention to the spin-orbit coupling
   effect, aiming to assess its suitability for laser cooling
   applications.Methods Ab initio CASSCF/MRCI+Q calculations were carried
   out to obtain low-lying adiabatic potential energy curves with and
   without spin-orbit coupling taken into consideration. Static and
   transition dipole moments were evaluated, and the DUO and ExoCross
   programs were employed to simulate rovibronic spectra. Franck-Condon
   factors were calculated for transitions between the ground and excited
   electronic states.Results The spectroscopic constants of several
   electronic states were derived and compared with available literature
   values, showing good agreement. The Franck-Condon factor analysis
   identified a transition as favorable for Doppler and Sisyphus laser
   cooling. Radiative lifetimes, branching ratios, Doppler and recoil
   temperatures, and slowing distances were determined. A four-laser
   cooling scheme in the deep-UV region was proposed. Simulated absorption
   spectra for the P(2) and R(7) transitions in the first-overtone (v =
   0-2) band reproduced experimental data with reasonable
   accuracy.Discussion These findings confirm HBr as a promising candidate
   for laser cooling, supported by reasonably accurate ab initio potential
   and dipole moment curves. The proposed scheme and agreement with
   experimental spectra strengthen the feasibility of experimental
   implementation.},

Abstract = {The isotopically independent parameters U-mj, Delta(H)(mj) and
   Delta(Br)(mj )of the HBr molecule were determinedbased on the analysis
   of the experimental frequencies of transitions of six isotopic
   modifications. The result-ing values were used to calculate both the
   vibrational-rotational energies and transition frequencies up to
   thevibrational state v = 8 and the RKR potentials of six isotopologues.
   The calculated transition frequencies werecompared with data from the
   HITRAN database},
