Abstract = {The isotopically independent parameters U-mj, Delta(H)(mj) and
   Delta(Br)(mj )of the HBr molecule were determinedbased on the analysis
   of the experimental frequencies of transitions of six isotopic
   modifications. The result-ing values were used to calculate both the
   vibrational-rotational energies and transition frequencies up to
   thevibrational state v = 8 and the RKR potentials of six isotopologues.
   The calculated transition frequencies werecompared with data from the
   HITRAN database},
