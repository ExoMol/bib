abstract = {High-resolution infrared spectra of diacetylene (HC4H) are recorded in the 3 um CH stretch region using continuous wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy (cw-CRDS). The HC4H molecules are generated in a pulsed and supersonic planar plasma expansion by discharging a C2H2/He/Ar gas mixture. The jet-cooling realizes a low rotational temperature of Trot7K. Vibrational temperatures are found to be relatively high, allowing the detection of vibrationally excited HC4H in direct absorption with energies up to 1800cm1. In total, sixteen ro-vibrational bands are identified, where nine of them were not reported before. Detailed and systematic rotational analyses are presented, yielding spectroscopic parameters for a series of vibrational levels over energy regions of 0–1800 and 3300–5100cm 1. Using the observed infrared band intensities, two vibrational excitation temperatures of HC4H in the plasma jet, 570(50) K for the 6, 7 and 8 bending vibrations, and 125(10) K for the 9 bending vibration, are deduced.}
