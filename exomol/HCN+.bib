  abstract = {Electronic spectra of HCN+ are measured using leak-out spectroscopy (LOS), providing 
    insight into the nature of the excited state electronic wavefunction and demonstrating the 
    effectiveness of LOS for high-resolution electronic spectroscopy. The \~A2{$\Sigma$}+ \textleftarrow{} \~X2{$\Pi$} 
    electronic transition of the fundamental HCN+ ion is reported. The spectrum exhibits a 
    rotational, fine, and hyperfine structure that provides insights into the geometries and 
    wavefunctions of the \~A2{$\Sigma$}+ and \~X2{$\Pi$} states. The extracted spectroscopic constants 
    for the \~A state include (in cm-1) Te = 3238.8224(2), B = .39568(3), D = 2.27(9) \texttimes{} 10-5,
    {$\gamma$} = -0.07332(7), {$\gamma$} D = 1.87(3) \texttimes{} 10-4, and the Fermi contact hyperfine 
    constant for the HCN+ nitrogen atom bF  = 0.0059(1). Based on this value, the \~A2{$\Sigma$}1/2+               
    state electronic wavefunction is estimated to have 11.5 \textpm{} 0.2\% s orbital character. The 
    spin--orbit coupling constant for the \~X state was also determined with high precision ASO = -49.3122(4) cm-1.
    This work illustrates that leak-out spectroscopy can be applied to measure high-resolution spectra of 
    low energy electronic transitions.},
