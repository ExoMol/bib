Pages = {3126-3131},
Abstract = {Starting from ab initio electronic structure data, we develop
   parametrized analytic potential energy surfaces for the HCN and HNC
   isomers by variationally calculating rovibrational energy levels and
   adjusting the potential parameters so as to get agreement with
   experimentally derived transition frequencies to within about 1 cm(-1).
   We also determine an analytic expression in terms of molecular
   parameters to effortlessly calculate the rovibrational energy levels. We
   use the obtained empirical potentials to calculate rovibrational levels
   for eight isotopologues of HCN and eight of HNC up to about 4000 cm(-1)
   above the ground state. The energy levels are estimated to be accurate
   to within about 3 cm(-1) based on comparison to experimental
   rovibrational transition frequencies for (HCN)-C-12-N-14,
   (HCN)-C-12-N-14, (HCN)-C-13-N-14, and (HCN)-C-12-N-15. For all 16
   isotopologues, we calculate the zero-point energy and in nine cases we
   can compare with experimentally derived values. In these comparisons,
   the variationally obtained ZPE is within 5 cm(-1) of the experimentally
   derived value, while the closed expression gives values within 6 cm(-1)
   of the experimental values. For all 16 isotopologues, we also give
   molecular parameters from which the energy levels can easily be
   calculated using the closed expression. Endo- and exoergicities are
   given for 12 isotopic exchange reactions involving HCN/HNC and some
   isotopologues together with pre-exponential factors that should be
   useful in future modelling studies of rare isotopologues.},

Title = {Hubble WFC3 Spectroscopy of the Rocky Planet L 98-59 b: No Evidence for
   a Cloud-free Primordial Atmosphere},
Journal = AJ,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {164},
Abstract = {We are using archived data from HST of transiting exoplanet L 98-59 b to
   place constraints on its potentially hot atmosphere. We analyze the data
   from five transit visits and extract the final combined transmission
   spectrum using Iraclis. Then we use the inverse atmospheric retrieval
   code TauREx to analyze the combined transmission spectrum. There is a
   weak absorption feature near 1.40 mu m and 1.55 mu m in the transmission
   spectrum, which can be modeled by a cloudy atmosphere with abundant
   hydrogen cyanide (HCN). However, the unrealistically high abundance of
   HCN derived cannot be explained by any equilibrium chemical model with
   reasonable assumptions. Thus, the likeliest scenario is that L 98-59 b
   has a flat, featureless transmission spectrum in the WFC3/G141 bandpass
   due to a thin atmosphere with high mean molecular weight, an atmosphere
   with an opaque aerosol layer, or no atmosphere, and it is very unlikely
   for L 98-59 b to have a clear hydrogen-dominated primary atmosphere. Due
   to the narrow wavelength coverage and low spectral resolution of
   HST/WFC3 G141 grism observation, we cannot tell these different
   scenarios apart. Our simulation shows future higher precision
   measurements over wider wavelengths from the James Webb Space Telescope
   can be used to better characterize the planetary atmosphere of L 98-59b.},

Title = {{An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of HCN Production in the
   Hadean Earth Atmosphere}},
Journal = {ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY},
Abstract = {A critical early stage for the origin of life on Earth may have involved
   the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in a reducing, predominantly H2
   atmosphere. HCN is crucial for the origin of life as it is a possible
   precursor to several biomolecules that make up RNA and proteins
   including nucleobases, nucleotides, amino acids, and ribose. In this
   work, we perform an in-depth experimental and theoretical investigation
   of HCN production in reducing atmospheric conditions (89-95\% H-2)
   possibly representing the earliest stages of the Hadean eon,similar to
   4.5-4.3 billion years ago. We make use of cold plasma discharges-a
   laboratory analog to shortwave UV radiation-to simulate HCN production
   in the upper layers of the atmosphere for CH4 abundances ranging from
   0.1 to 6.5\%. We then combine experimental mass spectrum measurements
   with our theoretical plasma models to estimate the HCN concentrations
   produced in our experiments. We find that upper atmospheric HCN
   production scales linearly with CH(4 )abundance with the relation
   {[}HCN] = 0.13 +/- 0.01{[}CH4]. Concentrations of HCN near the surface
   of the Hadean Earth are expected to be about 2-3 orders of magnitude
   lower. The addition of 1\% water to our experiments results in a similar
   to 50\% reduction in HCN production. We find that four reactions are
   primarily responsible for HCN production in our experiments: (i) 4N +
   CH3 -> H2CN + H -> HCN + H-2, (ii) 4N + CH-{*} CN + H followed by CN +
   CH4 -> HCN + CH3, (iii) C2H4 + 4N -> HCN + CH3, and (iv) 4N + 3CH(2)->
   HCN + H. The most prebiotically favorable Hadean atmosphere would have
   been very rich in CH4 (> 5\%), and as a result of greenhouse effects,
   the surface would be likely very hot. In such a prebiotic scenario, it
   may have been important to incorporate HCN into organic hazes that could
   later release biomolecules and precursors into the first ponds.},

Title = {{Toward RNA Life on Early Earth: From Atmospheric HCN to Biomolecule
   Production in Warm Little Ponds}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {932},
Abstract = {The origin of life on Earth involves the early appearance of an
   information-containing molecule such as RNA. The basic building blocks
   of RNA could have been delivered by carbon-rich meteorites or produced
   in situ by processes beginning with the synthesis of hydrogen cyanide
   (HCN) in the early Earth's atmosphere. Here, we construct a robust
   physical and nonequilibrium chemical model of the early Earth's
   atmosphere. The atmosphere is supplied with hydrogen from impact
   degassing of meteorites, water evaporated from the oceans, carbon
   dioxide from volcanoes, and methane from undersea hydrothermal vents,
   and in it lightning and external UV-driven chemistry produce HCN. This
   allows us to calculate the rain-out of HCN into warm little ponds
   (WLPs). We then use a comprehensive numerical model of sources and sinks
   to compute the resulting abundances of nucleobases, ribose, and
   nucleotide precursors such as 2-aminooxazole resulting from aqueous and
   UV-driven chemistry within them. We find that 4.4 billion years ago the
   limit of adenine concentrations in ponds for habitable surfaces is 0.05
   mu M in the absence of seepage. Meteorite delivery of adenine to WLPs
   can provide boosts in concentration by 2-3 orders of magnitude, but
   these boosts deplete within months by UV photodissociation, seepage, and
   hydrolysis. The early evolution of the atmosphere is dominated by the
   decrease in hydrogen due to falling impact rates and atmospheric escape,
   and the rise of oxygenated species such as OH from H2O photolysis. The
   source of HCN is predominantly from UV radiation rather than lightning.
   Our work points to an early origin of RNA on Earth within similar to 200
   Myr of the Moon-forming impact.},

Title = {{Exploring HNC and HCN line emission as probes of the protoplanetary disk
   temperature}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {647},
pages = {A118},
Abstract = {Context. The distributions and abundances of molecules in protoplanetary
   disks are powerful tracers of the physical and chemical disk structures.
   The abundance ratios of HCN and its isomer HNC are known to be sensitive
   to gas temperature. Their line ratios might therefore offer a unique
   opportunity to probe the properties of the emitting gas.
   Aims. We investigate the HNC and HCN line emission in disks at
   (sub-)millimeter wavelengths and explore their potential utility for
   probing disk temperature and other disk properties.Methods. Using the 2D
   thermochemical code DALI, we ran a set of disk models accounting for
   different stellar properties and radial and vertical disk structures,
   with an updated chemical network for the nitrogen chemistry. These
   modeling results were then compared with observations, including new
   observations obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
   Array (ALMA) of HNC J = 3-2 for the TW Hya disk and HNC J = 1-0 for 29
   disks in Lupus.
   Results. Similar to CN, HCN and HNC have brighter line emission in
   models with larger disk flaring angles and higher UV fluxes. HNC and HCN
   are predicted to be abundant in the warm surface layer and outer
   midplane region, which results in ring-shaped emission patterns.
   However, the precise emitting regions and emission morphology depend on
   the probed transition, as well as on other parameters such as C and O
   abundances. The modeled HNC-to-HCN line intensity ratio increases from
   <0.1 in the inner disk to up to 0.8 in the outer disk regions, which can
   be explained by efficient HNC destruction at high temperatures.
   Disk-integrated HNC line fluxes from current scarce observations and its
   radial distribution in the TW Hya disk are broadly consistent with our
   model predictions.
   Conclusions. The HNC-to-HCN flux ratio robustly increases with radius
   (decreasing temperature), but its use as a chemical thermometer in disks
   is affected by other factors, including UV flux and C and O abundances.
   High-spatial resolution ALMA disk observations of HNC and HCN that can
   locate the emitting layers would have the great potential to constrain
   both the disk thermal and UV radiation structures, and also to verify
   our understanding of the nitrogen chemistry.},

   Probing the Extreme Environment toward the Orion Hot Core}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {907},
pages = {51},
Abstract = {We present the first mid-infrared (MIR) detections of HNC and (HCN)-C-13
   in the interstellar medium, and numerous resolved HCN rovibrational
   transitions. Our observations span 12.8-22.9 mu m toward the hot core
   Orion IRc2, obtained with the Echelon-Cross-Echelle Spectrograph aboard
   the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). In
   particular, similar to 5 km.s(-1) resolution distinguishes individual
   rovibrational transitions of the HNC and HCN P, Q, and R branches; and
   the (HCN)-C-13 R branch. This allows direct measurement of the species'
   excitation temperatures, column densities, and relative abundances. HNC
   and (HCN)-C-13 exhibit a local standard of rest velocity of -7 km.s(-1)
   that may be associated with an outflow from nearby radio source I and an
   excitation temperature of about 100 K. We resolve two velocity
   components for HCN, the primary component also being at -7 km.s(-1) with
   a temperature of 165 K. The hottest component, which had never before
   been observed, is at 1 km.s(-1) with a temperature of 309 K. This is the
   closest component to the hot core's center measured to date. The derived
   C-12/C-13 = 13 +/- 2 is below expectation for Orion's Galactocentric
   distance, but the derived HCN/ HNC = 72 +/- 7 is expected for this
   extreme environment. Compared to previous sub-millimeter and millimeter
   observations, our SOFIA line survey of this region shows that the
   resolved MIR molecular transitions are probing a distinct physical
   component and isolating the chemistry closest to the hot core.},

   devolatilization phase of straw pellets gasification is demonstrated
   with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mid-infrared degenerate
   four-wave mixing (IR-DFWM) measurements of HCN were performed by probing
   the interference-free P(20) line in the v(1) vibrational band at around
   3 mu m and the IR-DFWM signal was detected with an upconversion-based
   detector, providing discrimination of thermal noise and increased
   sensitivity. A novel single-pellet setup consisting of a multi-jet
   burner was used to provide hot flue gas environments with an even and
   well-defined temperature distribution, for single straw pellet
   gasification at atmospheric pressure. The environments had temperatures
   of 1380 K, 1540 K and 1630 K with a constant oxygen concentration of 0.5
   vol\%. In order to quantify the amount of HCN released during the
   devolatilization of straw pellets, calibration measurements were
   performed in well-defined HCN gas flows. Selected hot water lines were
   probed with IR-DFWM in the interrogated volume to obtain the
   instantaneous temperature, which were used to correct the temperature
   effect. HCN concentrations up to 1500 ppm were detected during the
   devolatilization stage, and the results indicate a strong temperature
   dependence of the HCN release. },

Abstract = {High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy provides a powerful means for
   chemical detections in exoplanetary atmospheres. This approach involves
   monitoring hundreds of molecular lines in the planetary spectrum Doppler
   shifted by the orbital motion of the planet. The molecules are detected
   by cross-correlating the observed spectrum of the system with a model
   planetary spectrum. The method has led to molecular detections of H2O,
   CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large ground-based telescopes.
   Critical to this method, however, is the accurate removal of the stellar
   and telluric features from the observed spectrum, also known as
   detrending. Previous molecular detections have relied on specific
   choices of detrending methods and parameters. However, the robustness of
   molecular detections across the different choices has not been
   investigated in detail. We conduct a systematic investigation of the
   effect of detrending algorithms, parameters, and optimizations on
   chemical detections using high-resolution spectroscopy. As a case study,
   we consider the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Using multiple methods, we
   confirm high-significance detections of H2O (4.8 sigma) and CO (4.7
   sigma). Additionally, we report evidence for HCN at high significance
   (5.0 sigma). On the other hand, our results highlight the need for
   improved metrics and extended observations for robust confirmations of
   such detections. In particular, we show that detection significances of
   greater than or similar to 4 sigma can be obtained by optimizing
   detrending at incorrect locations in the planetary velocity space; such
   false-positives can occur in nearly 30 per cent of cases. We discuss
   approaches to help distinguish molecular detections from spurious noise.},

   This method involves monitoring the spectral lines of the planetary

Abstract = {The impact of the photodissociation of HCN and HNC isomers is analyzed
   in different astrophysical environments. For this purpose, the
   individual photodissociation cross sections of HCN and HNC isomers have
   been calculated in the 7-13.6 eV photon energy range for a temperature
   of 10 K. These calculations are based on the ab initio calculation of
   three-dimensional adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the 21 lower
   electronic states. The cross sections are then obtained using a quantum
   wave packet calculation of the rotational transitions needed to simulate
   a rotational temperature of 10 K. The cross section calculated for HCN
   shows significant differences with respect to the experimental one, and
   this is attributed to the need to consider non-adiabatic transitions.
   Ratios between the photodissociation rates of HCN and HNC under
   different ultraviolet radiation fields have been computed by
   renormalizing the rates to the experimental value. It is found that HNC
   is photodissociated faster than HCN by a factor of 2.2 for the local
   interstellar radiation field and 9.2 for the solar radiation field, at 1
   au. We conclude that to properly describe the HNC/ HCN abundance ratio
   in astronomical environments illuminated by an intense ultraviolet
   radiation field, it is necessary to use different photodissociation
   rates for each of the two isomers, which are obtained by integrating the
   product of the photodissociation cross sections and ultraviolet
   radiation field over the relevant wavelength range.},

Journal = {Energy Fuels},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {2156-2163},
Abstract = {Hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) has been proposed as an important intermediate
   in oxidation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in combustion, but details of its
   chemistry are still in discussion. At higher temperatures, HCN and HNC
   equilibrate rapidly, and being more reactive than HCN, HNC offers a fast
   alternative route of oxidation for cyanides. However, in previous
   modeling, it has been required to omit the HNC subset partly or fully in
   the reaction mechanisms to obtain satisfactory predictions. In the
   present work, we re-examine the chemistry of HNC and its role in
   combustion nitrogen chemistry. The HNC + O-2 reaction is studied by ab
   initio methods and is shown to have a high barrier. Consequently, the
   omission of this reaction in recent modeling studies is justified. With
   the present knowledge of the HNC chemistry, including an accurate value
   of the heat of formation for HNC and improved rate constants for HNC +
   O-2 and HNC + OH, it is possible to reconcile the modeling issues and
   provide a satisfactory prediction of a wide range of experimental
   results on HCN oxidation. In the burned gases of fuel-rich flames, HCN
   and the CN radical are partially equilibrated and the sequence HCN
   ->(+M) HNC ->+(OH) HNCO is the major consumption path for HCN. Under
   lean conditions, HNC is shown to be less important than indicated by the
   early work by Lin and co-workers, but it acts to accelerate HCN
   oxidation and promotes the formation of HNCO.},

abstract = {We present a dual-comb spectrometer based on two passively mode-locked
waveguide lasers integrated in a single Er-doped ZBLAN chip. This original design
yields two free-running frequency combs having a high level of mutual stability.
We developed in parallel a self-correction algorithm that compensates residual
relative fluctuations and yields mode-resolved spectra without the help of any
reference laser or control system. Fluctuations are extracted directly from the
interferograms using the concept of ambiguity function, which leads to a significant
simplification of the instrument that will greatly ease its widespread adoption
and commercial deployment. Comparison with a correction algorithm relying on a
single-frequency laser indicates discrepancies of only 50 attoseconds on optical
timings. The capacities of this instrument are finally demonstrated with the acquisition
of a high-resolution molecular spectrum covering 20 nm. This new chip-based multi-laser
platform is ideal for the development of high-repetition-rate, compact and fieldable
comb spectrometers in the near- and mid-infrared.},

Abstract = {Aims. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) radiates effectively at infrared
   wavelengths in cometary atmospheres, and a new quantum-band model is
   needed to properly interpret high-resolution spectra. HCN spectra of
   comets 8P/Tuttle, C/2007 W1 (Boattini), and C/2008 Q3 (Garradd) have
   been recorded by our team using the high-resolution CRyogenic InfraRed
   Echelle Spectometer (CRIRES) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT),
   ultimately posing an excellent test for our newly developed model.
   Methods. We developed a quantum-band model for the nu(1) fundamental of
   HCN using the latest spectroscopic parameters available and with it
   retrieved HCN in the above mentioned three comets. For each comet, we
   sampled several lines of HCN in the spectral region near 3 mu m, and
   retrieved molecular production rates, mixing ratios, and rotational
   temperatures.
   Results. When compared to other comets, 8P/Tuttle is relatively depleted
   in HCN, while C/2007 W1 (Boattini) appears to be enriched and C/2008 Q3
   (Garradd) normal. The spatial profile of HCN observed in 8P/Tuttle is
   symmetric, consistent with isotropic outgassing from the nucleus, while
   in comet C/2007 W1 we observed an asymmetric excess of HCN in the
   anti-solar direction. We investigated the HCN-CN parentage by comparing
   our production rate ratios (HCN/H2O) with those of CN/OH derived at
   optical wavelengths. In comet C/2007 W1 the two mixing ratios are
   comparable, while in 8P/Tuttle our derived HCN abundance is too low to
   support the HCN molecule as the only parent of the CN radical.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {733},
pages = {102},
Abstract = {We report high signal-to-noise Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of
   a sample of 11 classical T Tauri stars. Molecular emission from
   rotational transitions of H2O and OH and rovibrational bands of simple
   organic molecules (CO2, HCN, C2H2) is common among the sources in the
   sample. The emission shows a range in both flux and line-to-continuum
   ratio for each molecule and in the flux ratios of different molecular
   species. The gas temperatures (200-800 K) and emitting areas we derive
   are consistent with the emission originating in a warm disk atmosphere
   in the inner planet formation region at radii <2 AU. The H2O emission
   appears to form under a limited range of excitation conditions, as
   demonstrated by the similarity in relative strengths of H2O features
   from star to star and the narrow range in derived temperature and column
   density. Emission from highly excited rotational levels of OH is present
   in all stars; the OH emission flux increases with the stellar accretion
   rate, and the OH/H2O flux ratio shows a relatively small scatter. We
   interpret these results as evidence for OH production via FUV
   photodissociation of H2O in the disk surface layers. No obvious
   explanation is found for the observed range in the relative emission
   strengths of different organic molecules or in their strength with
   respect to water. We put forward the possibility that these variations
   reflect a diversity in organic abundances due to star-to-star
   differences in the C/O ratio of the inner disk gas. Stars with the
   largest HCN/H2O flux ratios in our sample have the largest disk masses.
   While larger samples are required to confirm this, we speculate that
   such a trend could result if higher mass disks are more efficient at
   planetesimal formation and sequestration of water in the outer disk,
   leading to enhanced C/O ratios and abundances of organic molecules in
   the inner disk. A comparison of our derived HCN-to-H2O column density
   ratio to comets, hot cores, and outer T Tauri star disks suggests that
   the inner disks are chemically active.},

   perturbation theoretical calculations are no more valid. We show that

   the accommodation of the vibrational states to the double well structure
   of the potential takes place. },

Vibrational Levels on Automatically Generated IMLS Potential Energy Surfaces}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {4709-4721},
Abstract = {We report here calculated J = 0 vibrational frequenc for (CH2)-C-1
   and HCN with root-mean-square error relative to available measurements
   of 2.0 cm(-1) and 3.2 cm(-1), respectively. These results are obtained
   with DVR calculations with a dense grid on ab initio potential energy
   surfaces (PESs). The ab initio electronic structure calculations
   employed are Davidson-corrected MRCI calculations with double-, triple-,
   and quadruple-zeta basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set
   (CBS) limit. In the (CH2)-C-1 case, Full Cl tests of the Davidson
   correction at small basis set levels lead to a scaling of the correction
   with the bend angle that can be profitably applied at the CBS limit.
   Core-valence corrections are added derived from CCSD(T) calculations
   with and without frozen cores. Relativistic and non-Born-Oppenheimer
   corrections are available for HCN and were applied. CBS limit CCSD(T)
   and CASPT2 calculations with the same basis sets were also tried for
   HCN. The CCSD(T) results are noticeably less accurate than the MRCI
   results while the CASPT2 results are much poorer. The PESs were
   generated automatically using the local interpolative moving
   least-squares method (L-IMLS). A general triatomic code is described
   where the L-IMLS method is interfaced with several common electronic
   structure packages. All PESs were computed with this code running in
   parallel on eight processors. The L-IMLS method provides global and
   local fitting error measures important in automatically growing the PES
   from initial ab initio seed points. The reliability of this approach was
   tested for (CH2)-C-1 by comparing DVR-calculated vibrational levels on
   an L-IMLS ab initio surface with levels generated by an explicit ab
   initio calculation at each DVR grid point. For all levels (similar to
   200) below 20 000 cm(-1), the mean unsigned difference between the
   levels of these two calculations was 0.1 cm(-1), consistent with the
   L-IMLS estimated mean unsigned fitting error of 0.3 cm(-1). All L-IMLS
   PESs used in this work have comparable mean unsigned fitting errors,
   implying that fitting errors have a negligible role in the final errors
   of the computed vibrational levels with experiment. Less than 500 ab
   initio calculations of the energy and gradients are required to achieve
   this level of accuracy.},

   stars, significantly adding to the known population of optically
   invisible carbon stars in the LMC. We also present spectra for six
   IR-bright stars in or near three clusters in the LMC, identifying four
   of them as carbon stars and two as oxygen-rich supergiants. We analyse
   the molecular bands of C2H2 at 3.1 and 3.8 mu m, HCN at 3.57 mu m, and
   sharp absorption features in the 3.70-3.78 mu m region that we attribute
   to C2H2. There is evidence for a generally high abundance of C2H2 in LMC
   carbon stars, suggestive of high carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios at
   the low metallicity in the LMC. The low initial metallicity is also
   likely to have resulted in less abundant HCN and CS. The sample of IR
   carbon stars exhibits a range in C2H2:HCN abundance ratio. We do not
   find strong correlations between the properties of the molecular
   atmosphere and circumstellar dust envelope, but the observed differences
   in the strengths and shapes of the absorption bands can be explained by
   differences in excitation temperature. High mass-loss rates and strong
   pulsation would then be seen to be associated with a large scale height

Abstract = {Observations of Jupiter by Cassini/CIRS, acquired during the December
   2000 flyby, provide the latitudinal distribution of HCN and CO2 in
   Jupiter's stratosphere with unprecedented spatial resolution and
   coverage. Following up on a preliminary study by Kunde et al. {[}Kunde,
   VG., and 41 colleagues, 2004. Science 305, 1582-1587], the analysis of
   these observations leads to two unexpected results (i) the total HCN
   mass in Jupiter's stratosphere in 2000 was (6.0 +/- 1.5) x 10(13) g,
   i.e., at least three times larger than measured immediately after the
   Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) impacts in July 1994 and (ii) the latitudinal
   distributions of HCN and CO2 are strikingly different: while HCN
   exhibits a maximum at 45 S and a sharp decrease towards high Southern
   latitudes, the CO2 column densities peak over the South Pole. The total
   CO2 mass is (2.9 +/- 1.2) x 10(13) g. A possible cause for the HCN mass
   increase is its production from the photolysis of NH3, although a
   problem remains because, while millimeter-wave observations clearly
   indicate that HCN is currently restricted to submillibar (similar to 0.3
   mbar) levels, immediate post-impact infrared observations have suggested
   that most of the ammonia was present in the lower stratosphere near 20
   mbar. HCN appears to be a good atmospheric tracer, with negligible
   chemical losses. Based on 1-dimensional (latitude) transport models, the
   HCN distribution is best interpreted as resulting from the combination
   of a sharp decrease (over an order of magnitude in K-yy) of wave-induced
   eddy mixing poleward of 40 and an equatorward transport with similar to
   7 cm s(-1) velocity. The CO2 distribution was investigated by coupling
   the transport model with an elementary chemical model, in which CO2 is
   produced from the conversion of water originating either from SL9 or
   from auroral input. The auroral source does not appear adequate to
   reproduce the CO2 peak over the South Pole, as required fluxes are
   unrealistically high and the shape of the CO2 bulge is not properly
   matched. In contrast, the CO2 distribution can be fit by invoking
   poleward transport with a similar to 30 cm s(-1) velocity and vigorous
   eddy mixing (K-yy = 2 x 10(11) cm(2) s(-1)). While the vertical
   distribution of CO2 is not measured, the combined HCN and CO2 results
   imply that the two species reside at different stratospheric levels.
   Comparing with the circulation regimes predicted by earlier
   radiative-dynamical models of Jupiter's stratosphere, and with
   inferences from the ethane and acetylene stratospheric latitudinal
   distribution, we suggest that CO2 lies in the middle stratosphere near
   or below the 5-mbar level.},

Pages = {112-136},
Abstract = {Measurements and modeling of the (3-2) rotational line of hydrogen
   cyanide at 265.9 GHz in Neptune's atmosphere are presented. High
   signal-to-noise observations, performed at IRAM in October 1991 and
   April 1992, provide information on the HCN vertical distribution in
   Neptune's stratosphere. The HCN mixing ratio is found to be nearly
   uniform with height above the condensation level (3 mbar). Best fits
   occur for HCN distributions that have a slight increase with altitude
   (HCN scale height approximately 5x the atmospheric scale height). A
   least-squares analysis yields a mixing ratio of (3.2 +/- 0.8) 10(-10) at
   2 mbar and a mean mixing ratio scale height of 250(+750/-110) km in the
   0.1-3 mbar region. To interpret these results, we developed a
   photochemical model of HCN, based in part upon the hydrocarbon model of
   Romani et al. (Icarus, 106, 442-463 (1993)). HCN formation is initiated
   by the reaction between CH3 radicals, produced from methane
   photochemistry, and N atoms. The primary sink for HCN is condensation,
   with minor contributions from photolysis and chemical losses. Two
   possible sources of N atoms are investigated: (1) infall of N escaped
   from Triton's upper atmosphere, and (2) galactic cosmic ray (GCR) impact
   on internal N2. For the Triton source, a total N flux of 5 x 10(24)
   atoms sec-1 is necessary to match the HCN abundance, and the observed
   HCN profile suggests an eddy diffusion profile with a rapid transition
   from slow mixing at p greater-than-or-equal-to 2 mbar to rapid mixing at
   lower pressures. The required N flux is approximately 50\% of the
   estimated N escape from Triton's upper atmosphere. For the GCR source, a
   simple model of ionization and dissociation of N2 by cosmic rays was
   developed. In this case, both smooth and discontinuous eddy K profiles
   satisfy the observations. The tropospheric N2 mixing ratio required to
   fit the HCN observations is in the range 0.3-1.7\% if our GCR
   interaction model is correct. The range results from uncertainties in
   the chemistry of the NH radical and in the eddy K profile. Our GCR
   model, however, disagrees with earlier models by Capone et al. (Icarus
   55, 73-82 (1983)) and, if the latter are correct, the required N2 mixing
   ratios are a factor of 6 larger. The GCR source leads to a higher
   formation rate of HCN ice than the Triton source, but one not large
   enough for HCN ice to be detected in the Voyager IRIS spectra.
   Additionally, the GCR source implies the possible formation of
   methylenimine (CH2NH) in amounts comparable to HCN. Given the
   uncertainties on (i) the transport and possible ionization of N in
   Neptune's magnetosphere, and the fate of N+ reaching Neptune's upper
   atmosphere and (ii) the N2 mixing ratio in Neptune' s deep atmosphere,
   we suggest that both sources of N atoms may significantly contribute to
   the formation of HCN. },

abstract = {Numerous bands of HCN and C2H2 are detected in high-resolution 3-micron
spectra of carbon stars. No prominent line absorption in the 3-micron band remains
unidentified. The strengths of the bands are very sensitive to stellar surface
temperature and cannot be readily interpreted as abundance indicators. No strong
evidence is found for a contribution to the 3-micron band by a continuous absorber
(e.g., C3 or grains), but a possible contribution in some cases cannot be ruled out.},
