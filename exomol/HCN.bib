Abstract = {{Transition state theory is central to our understanding of chemical

   the spacings of certain barrier-proximal vibrational levels-can be
   understood using the concept of effective frequency, omega(eff). The
   method is applied to the cis-trans conformational change in the S-1
   state of C2H2 and the bond-breaking HCN-HNC isomerization. In both
   cases, the barrier heights derived from spectroscopic data agree
   extremely well with previous ab initio calculations. We also show that

Abstract = {The {[}H,C,N] molecular system is a very important model system to many
   fields of chemical physics. The experimental characterization of highly
   excited vibrational states of this molecular system with a stable HCN
   and a metastable HNC isomer is of special interest. This work
   substantially extends the spectroscopic characterization of the
   rovibrational states of the {[}H,C, N] molecular system around the HNC
   minimum of the potential surface. The emission spectrum of the HNC
   isomer has been recorded at 1463 K using hot gas molecular emission
   (HOTGAME) spectroscopy from the far infrared up to the near infrared
   wavenumber region. The dense emission spectrum was analyzed using the
   spectrum analysis software SyMath (TM) implemented in the Mathematica
   (TM) computer algebra system. This work reports the analysis of highly
   excited rovibrational states. The rotational structure for 27
   vibrational states (0 nu(1)(2)1 states from nu(2) = 4 to nu(2) = 7, the
   0 nu(1)(2)2 from nu(2) =1 to nu(2) = 4 and 2 nu(1)(2)0 states from nu(2)
   = 3 to nu(2) = 4) have been characterized for the first time and for
   five known vibrational levels it was possible to improve the existing
   spectroscopic constants substantially. Together with the author's three
   recent papers accurate spectroscopic constants for 94 HNC rovibrational
   states have been determined. New expansion coefficients for the
   vibrational dependence of the spectroscopic constants are reported from
   the analysis of all these states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The {[}H, C, N] molecular system is a very important model system to

   HCN part of the potential surface using high temperature hot gas
   emission spectroscopy. The spectroscopic constants for the first 71
   vibrational states including highly excited bending vibrations up to
   nu(2) = 10 are reported. The perturbed eigenenergies for all 20
   rotational perturbations in the reported eigenenergy range have been
   determined. The 11 070 eigenenergies up to J = 90 for the first 123
   vibrational substates are included as supplement to this paper. We show
   that a complete ab initio rovibrational analysis for a polyatomic
   molecule is possible. Using such an analysis we can understand the
   molecular physics behind the Schrodinger equation for problems for which
   perturbation theoretical calculations are no more valid. We show that
   the vibrational structure of the linear HCN molecule persists
   approximately up to the isomerization barrier and only above the barrier
   the accommodation of the vibrational states to the double well structure
   of the potential takes place. }}

Volume = {{551}},
Abstract = {{Aims. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) radiates effectively at infrared
   wavelengths in cometary atmospheres, and a new quantum-band model is
   needed to properly interpret high-resolution spectra. HCN spectra of
   comets 8P/Tuttle, C/2007 W1 (Boattini), and C/2008 Q3 (Garradd) have
   been recorded by our team using the high-resolution CRyogenic InfraRed
   Echelle Spectometer (CRIRES) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT),
   ultimately posing an excellent test for our newly developed model.
   Methods. We developed a quantum-band model for the nu(1) fundamental of
   HCN using the latest spectroscopic parameters available and with it
   retrieved HCN in the above mentioned three comets. For each comet, we
   sampled several lines of HCN in the spectral region near 3 mu m, and
   retrieved molecular production rates, mixing ratios, and rotational
   temperatures.
   Results. When compared to other comets, 8P/Tuttle is relatively depleted
   in HCN, while C/2007 W1 (Boattini) appears to be enriched and C/2008 Q3
   (Garradd) normal. The spatial profile of HCN observed in 8P/Tuttle is
   symmetric, consistent with isotropic outgassing from the nucleus, while
   in comet C/2007 W1 we observed an asymmetric excess of HCN in the
   anti-solar direction. We investigated the HCN-CN parentage by comparing
   our production rate ratios (HCN/H2O) with those of CN/OH derived at
   optical wavelengths. In comet C/2007 W1 the two mixing ratios are
   comparable, while in 8P/Tuttle our derived HCN abundance is too low to
   support the HCN molecule as the only parent of the CN radical.}},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{733}},
Abstract = {{We report high signal-to-noise Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of
   a sample of 11 classical T Tauri stars. Molecular emission from
   rotational transitions of H2O and OH and rovibrational bands of simple
   organic molecules (CO2, HCN, C2H2) is common among the sources in the
   sample. The emission shows a range in both flux and line-to-continuum
   ratio for each molecule and in the flux ratios of different molecular
   species. The gas temperatures (200-800 K) and emitting areas we derive
   are consistent with the emission originating in a warm disk atmosphere
   in the inner planet formation region at radii <2 AU. The H2O emission
   appears to form under a limited range of excitation conditions, as
   demonstrated by the similarity in relative strengths of H2O features
   from star to star and the narrow range in derived temperature and column
   density. Emission from highly excited rotational levels of OH is present
   in all stars; the OH emission flux increases with the stellar accretion
   rate, and the OH/H2O flux ratio shows a relatively small scatter. We
   interpret these results as evidence for OH production via FUV
   photodissociation of H2O in the disk surface layers. No obvious
   explanation is found for the observed range in the relative emission
   strengths of different organic molecules or in their strength with
   respect to water. We put forward the possibility that these variations
   reflect a diversity in organic abundances due to star-to-star
   differences in the C/O ratio of the inner disk gas. Stars with the
   largest HCN/H2O flux ratios in our sample have the largest disk masses.
   While larger samples are required to confirm this, we speculate that
   such a trend could result if higher mass disks are more efficient at
   planetesimal formation and sequestration of water in the outer disk,
   leading to enhanced C/O ratios and abundances of organic molecules in
   the inner disk. A comparison of our derived HCN-to-H2O column density
   ratio to comets, hot cores, and outer T Tauri star disks suggests that
   the inner disks are chemically active.}},

   candidates. Out of 30 targets, 28 are positively identified as carbon
   stars, significantly adding to the known population of optically
   invisible carbon stars in the LMC. We also present spectra for six
   IR-bright stars in or near three clusters in the LMC, identifying four
   of them as carbon stars and two as oxygen-rich supergiants. We analyse
   the molecular bands of C2H2 at 3.1 and 3.8 mu m, HCN at 3.57 mu m, and
   sharp absorption features in the 3.70-3.78 mu m region that we attribute
   to C2H2. There is evidence for a generally high abundance of C2H2 in LMC
   carbon stars, suggestive of high carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios at
   the low metallicity in the LMC. The low initial metallicity is also
   likely to have resulted in less abundant HCN and CS. The sample of IR
   carbon stars exhibits a range in C2H2:HCN abundance ratio. We do not
   find strong correlations between the properties of the molecular
   atmosphere and circumstellar dust envelope, but the observed differences
   in the strengths and shapes of the absorption bands can be explained by
   differences in excitation temperature. High mass-loss rates and strong
   pulsation would then be seen to be associated with a large scale height
   of the molecular atmosphere.}},

   determined to be 0.54-4.5 in the observed dark cloud cores. These
   results are consistent with the idea that HCN and HNC are produced
   mainly by a recombination reaction of HCNH+ with electrons in dark cloud

   significant differences between star-forming cores and starless cores.

Abstract = {{We report here calculated J = 0 vibrational frequenc for (CH2)-C-1
   and HCN with root-mean-square error relative to available measurements
   of 2.0 cm(-1) and 3.2 cm(-1), respectively. These results are obtained
   with DVR calculations with a dense grid on ab initio potential energy
   surfaces (PESs). The ab initio electronic structure calculations
   employed are Davidson-corrected MRCI calculations with double-, triple-,
   and quadruple-zeta basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set
   (CBS) limit. In the (CH2)-C-1 case, Full Cl tests of the Davidson
   correction at small basis set levels lead to a scaling of the correction
   with the bend angle that can be profitably applied at the CBS limit.
   Core-valence corrections are added derived from CCSD(T) calculations
   with and without frozen cores. Relativistic and non-Born-Oppenheimer
   corrections are available for HCN and were applied. CBS limit CCSD(T)
   and CASPT2 calculations with the same basis sets were also tried for
   HCN. The CCSD(T) results are noticeably less accurate than the MRCI
   results while the CASPT2 results are much poorer. The PESs were
   generated automatically using the local interpolative moving
   least-squares method (L-IMLS). A general triatomic code is described
   where the L-IMLS method is interfaced with several common electronic
   structure packages. All PESs were computed with this code running in
   parallel on eight processors. The L-IMLS method provides global and
   local fitting error measures important in automatically growing the PES
   from initial ab initio seed points. The reliability of this approach was
   tested for (CH2)-C-1 by comparing DVR-calculated vibrational levels on
   an L-IMLS ab initio surface with levels generated by an explicit ab
   initio calculation at each DVR grid point. For all levels (similar to
   200) below 20 000 cm(-1), the mean unsigned difference between the
   levels of these two calculations was 0.1 cm(-1), consistent with the
   L-IMLS estimated mean unsigned fitting error of 0.3 cm(-1). All L-IMLS
   PESs used in this work have comparable mean unsigned fitting errors,
   implying that fitting errors have a negligible role in the final errors
   of the computed vibrational levels with experiment. Less than 500 ab
   initio calculations of the energy and gradients are required to achieve
   this level of accuracy.}},

   transitions of (HCN)-C-12-N-15 and (HCN)-C-13-N-15. These Q-branch
   transitions are forbidden even when the effects of l-type resonance are
   considered so they must get their intensity from some other Coriolis
   interactions, The much stronger P-and R-branch lines for the e levels of
   these same vibrational transitions were also measured and they are shown
   to get most of their intensity from l-type resonance. However, the same
   Coriolis resonance that gives intensity to the Q-branch transitions
   seems to affect the Delta J = +/-1 transitions as shown by the
   difference in the intensities of the Delta J = +1 and Delta J = -1
   transitions. Measurements of the intensity of the 03(3e)0-00(0)0 and
   03(3f)0-00(0)0 transitions shows that they derive most, but perhaps not
   all, of their intensity from I-type resonance. An unsuccessful search
   for forbidden Delta J = 0, e-e transitions for the strong 10(0)0-00(0)0
   band shows that there is no detectable mixing of the e and f levels.}},

Journal = {energy \&\ Fuels},

Pages = {2156-2163},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) has been proposed as an important intermediate
   in oxidation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in combustion, but details of its
   chemistry are still in discussion. At higher temperatures, HCN and HNC
   equilibrate rapidly, and being more reactive than HCN, HNC offers a fast
   alternative route of oxidation for cyanides. However, in previous
   modeling, it has been required to omit the HNC subset partly or fully in
   the reaction mechanisms to obtain satisfactory predictions. In the
   present work, we re-examine the chemistry of HNC and its role in
   combustion nitrogen chemistry. The HNC + O-2 reaction is studied by ab
   initio methods and is shown to have a high barrier. Consequently, the
   omission of this reaction in recent modeling studies is justified. With
   the present knowledge of the HNC chemistry, including an accurate value
   of the heat of formation for HNC and improved rate constants for HNC +
   O-2 and HNC + OH, it is possible to reconcile the modeling issues and
   provide a satisfactory prediction of a wide range of experimental
   results on HCN oxidation. In the burned gases of fuel-rich flames, HCN
   and the CN radical are partially equilibrated and the sequence HCN
   ->(+M) HNC ->+(OH) HNCO is the major consumption path for HCN. Under
   lean conditions, HNC is shown to be less important than indicated by the
   early work by Lin and co-workers, but it acts to accelerate HCN
   oxidation and promotes the formation of HNCO.}},

Title = {{The Photodissociation of HCN and HNC: Effects on the HNC/HCN Abundance
   Ratio in the Interstellar Medium}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{838}},
Abstract = {{The impact of the photodissociation of HCN and HNC isomers is analyzed
   in different astrophysical environments. For this purpose, the
   individual photodissociation cross sections of HCN and HNC isomers have
   been calculated in the 7-13.6 eV photon energy range for a temperature
   of 10 K. These calculations are based on the ab initio calculation of
   three-dimensional adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the 21 lower
   electronic states. The cross sections are then obtained using a quantum
   wave packet calculation of the rotational transitions needed to simulate
   a rotational temperature of 10 K. The cross section calculated for HCN
   shows significant differences with respect to the experimental one, and
   this is attributed to the need to consider non-adiabatic transitions.
   Ratios between the photodissociation rates of HCN and HNC under
   different ultraviolet radiation fields have been computed by
   renormalizing the rates to the experimental value. It is found that HNC
   is photodissociated faster than HCN by a factor of 2.2 for the local
   interstellar radiation field and 9.2 for the solar radiation field, at 1
   au. We conclude that to properly describe the HNC/ HCN abundance ratio
   in astronomical environments illuminated by an intense ultraviolet
   radiation field, it is necessary to use different photodissociation
   rates for each of the two isomers, which are obtained by integrating the
   product of the photodissociation cross sections and ultraviolet
   radiation field over the relevant wavelength range.}},
