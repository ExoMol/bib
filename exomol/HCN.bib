Abstract = {{Recent works have shown that the spectroscopic access to highly excited
   states provides enough information to characterize transition states in
   isomerization reactions. Here, we show that information about the
   transition state of the bond-breaking HCN-HNC isomerization reaction can
   also be achieved with the two-dimensional limit of the algebraic vibron
   model. We describe the system's bending vibration with the algebraic
   Hamiltonian and use its classical limit to characterize the transition
   state. Using either the coherent state formalism or a recently proposed
   approach by Baraban et al. {[}Science 2015, 350, 1338-1342], we obtain
   an accurate description of the isomerization transition state. In
   addition, we show that the energy-level dynamics and the transition
   state wave function structure indicate that the spectrum in the vicinity
   of the isomerization saddle point can be understood in terms of the
   formalism for excited-state quantum phase transitions.}},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{482}},
Pages = {4422-4436},
Abstract = {{High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy provides a powerful means for
   chemical detections in exoplanetary atmospheres. This approach involves
   monitoring hundreds of molecular lines in the planetary spectrum Doppler
   shifted by the orbital motion of the planet. The molecules are detected
   by cross-correlating the observed spectrum of the system with a model
   planetary spectrum. The method has led to molecular detections of H2O,
   CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large ground-based telescopes.
   Critical to this method, however, is the accurate removal of the stellar
   and telluric features from the observed spectrum, also known as
   detrending. Previous molecular detections have relied on specific
   choices of detrending methods and parameters. However, the robustness of
   molecular detections across the different choices has not been
   investigated in detail. We conduct a systematic investigation of the
   effect of detrending algorithms, parameters, and optimizations on
   chemical detections using high-resolution spectroscopy. As a case study,
   we consider the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Using multiple methods, we
   confirm high-significance detections of H2O (4.8 sigma) and CO (4.7
   sigma). Additionally, we report evidence for HCN at high significance
   (5.0 sigma). On the other hand, our results highlight the need for
   improved metrics and extended observations for robust confirmations of
   such detections. In particular, we show that detection significances of
   greater than or similar to 4 sigma can be obtained by optimizing
   detrending at incorrect locations in the planetary velocity space; such
   false-positives can occur in nearly 30 per cent of cases. We discuss
   approaches to help distinguish molecular detections from spurious noise.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular species in planetary atmospheres provide key insights into
   their atmospheric processes and formation conditions. In recent years,
   high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy in the near-infrared has allowed
   detections of H2O and CO in the atmospheres of several hot Jupiters.
   This method involves monitoring the spectral lines of the planetary
   thermal emission Doppler-shifted due to the radial velocity of the
   planet over its orbit. However, aside from CO and H2O, which are the
   primary oxygen-and carbon-bearing species in hot H-2-rich atmospheres,
   little else is known about the molecular compositions of hot Jupiters.
   Several recent studies have suggested the importance and detectability
   of nitrogen-bearing species in such atmospheres. In this Letter, we
   confirm potential detections of CO and H2O in the hot Jupiter HD 209458b
   using high-resolution spectroscopy. We also report a cross-correlation
   peak with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.7 from a search for HCN. The
   results are obtained using high-resolution phase-resolved spectroscopy
   with the Very Large Telescope CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle
   Spectrograph (VLT CRIRES) and standard analysis methods reported in the

   residuals would improve confidence and enable unambiguous molecular
   detections. The presence of HCN could provide constraints on the C/O
   ratio of HD 209458b and its potential origins.}},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{838}},
Abstract = {{The impact of the photodissociation of HCN and HNC isomers is analyzed
   in different astrophysical environments. For this purpose, the
   individual photodissociation cross sections of HCN and HNC isomers have
   been calculated in the 7-13.6 eV photon energy range for a temperature
   of 10 K. These calculations are based on the ab initio calculation of
   three-dimensional adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the 21 lower
   electronic states. The cross sections are then obtained using a quantum
   wave packet calculation of the rotational transitions needed to simulate
   a rotational temperature of 10 K. The cross section calculated for HCN
   shows significant differences with respect to the experimental one, and
   this is attributed to the need to consider non-adiabatic transitions.
   Ratios between the photodissociation rates of HCN and HNC under
   different ultraviolet radiation fields have been computed by
   renormalizing the rates to the experimental value. It is found that HNC
   is photodissociated faster than HCN by a factor of 2.2 for the local
   interstellar radiation field and 9.2 for the solar radiation field, at 1
   au. We conclude that to properly describe the HNC/ HCN abundance ratio
   in astronomical environments illuminated by an intense ultraviolet
   radiation field, it is necessary to use different photodissociation
   rates for each of the two isomers, which are obtained by integrating the
   product of the photodissociation cross sections and ultraviolet
   radiation field over the relevant wavelength range.}},

Pages = {2156-2163},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) has been proposed as an important intermediate
   in oxidation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in combustion, but details of its
   chemistry are still in discussion. At higher temperatures, HCN and HNC
   equilibrate rapidly, and being more reactive than HCN, HNC offers a fast
   alternative route of oxidation for cyanides. However, in previous
   modeling, it has been required to omit the HNC subset partly or fully in
   the reaction mechanisms to obtain satisfactory predictions. In the
   present work, we re-examine the chemistry of HNC and its role in
   combustion nitrogen chemistry. The HNC + O-2 reaction is studied by ab
   initio methods and is shown to have a high barrier. Consequently, the
   omission of this reaction in recent modeling studies is justified. With
   the present knowledge of the HNC chemistry, including an accurate value
   of the heat of formation for HNC and improved rate constants for HNC +
   O-2 and HNC + OH, it is possible to reconcile the modeling issues and
   provide a satisfactory prediction of a wide range of experimental
   results on HCN oxidation. In the burned gases of fuel-rich flames, HCN
   and the CN radical are partially equilibrated and the sequence HCN
   ->(+M) HNC ->+(OH) HNCO is the major consumption path for HCN. Under
   lean conditions, HNC is shown to be less important than indicated by the
   early work by Lin and co-workers, but it acts to accelerate HCN
   oxidation and promotes the formation of HNCO.}},

abstract = {We present a dual-comb spectrometer based on two passively mode-locked waveguide lasers integrated in a single Er-doped ZBLAN chip. This original design yields two free-running frequency combs having a high level of mutual stability. We developed in parallel a self-correction algorithm that compensates residual relative fluctuations and yields mode-resolved spectra without the help of any reference laser or control system. Fluctuations are extracted directly from the interferograms using the concept of ambiguity function, which leads to a significant simplification of the instrument that will greatly ease its widespread adoption and commercial deployment. Comparison with a correction algorithm relying on a single-frequency laser indicates discrepancies of only 50 attoseconds on optical timings. The capacities of this instrument are finally demonstrated with the acquisition of a high-resolution molecular spectrum covering 20 nm. This new chip-based multi-laser platform is ideal for the development of high-repetition-rate, compact and fieldable comb spectrometers in the near- and mid-infrared.}

The carbon and nitrogen ratios are consistent with and improve on the precision of previous results, confirming a factor of ∼2.3 elevation in 14 N/ 15 N in HCN compared to N 2 and a lack of fractionation in 12 C/ 13 C from the protosolar value.

   Methods. We developed a quantum-band model for the nu(1) fundamental of
   HCN using the latest spectroscopic parameters available and with it
   retrieved HCN in the above mentioned three comets. For each comet, we
   sampled several lines of HCN in the spectral region near 3 mu m, and

   temperatures.
   Results. When compared to other comets, 8P/Tuttle is relatively depleted

   (Garradd) normal. The spatial profile of HCN observed in 8P/Tuttle is
   symmetric, consistent with isotropic outgassing from the nucleus, while
   in comet C/2007 W1 we observed an asymmetric excess of HCN in the
   anti-solar direction. We investigated the HCN-CN parentage by comparing
   our production rate ratios (HCN/H2O) with those of CN/OH derived at

Abstract = {{We report high signal-to-noise Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph spectra of
   a sample of 11 classical T Tauri stars. Molecular emission from
   rotational transitions of H2O and OH and rovibrational bands of simple
   organic molecules (CO2, HCN, C2H2) is common among the sources in the
   sample. The emission shows a range in both flux and line-to-continuum
   ratio for each molecule and in the flux ratios of different molecular
   species. The gas temperatures (200-800 K) and emitting areas we derive
   are consistent with the emission originating in a warm disk atmosphere
   in the inner planet formation region at radii <2 AU. The H2O emission
   appears to form under a limited range of excitation conditions, as
   demonstrated by the similarity in relative strengths of H2O features
   from star to star and the narrow range in derived temperature and column
   density. Emission from highly excited rotational levels of OH is present
   in all stars; the OH emission flux increases with the stellar accretion
   rate, and the OH/H2O flux ratio shows a relatively small scatter. We
   interpret these results as evidence for OH production via FUV
   photodissociation of H2O in the disk surface layers. No obvious
   explanation is found for the observed range in the relative emission
   strengths of different organic molecules or in their strength with
   respect to water. We put forward the possibility that these variations
   reflect a diversity in organic abundances due to star-to-star
   differences in the C/O ratio of the inner disk gas. Stars with the
   largest HCN/H2O flux ratios in our sample have the largest disk masses.
   While larger samples are required to confirm this, we speculate that
   such a trend could result if higher mass disks are more efficient at
   planetesimal formation and sequestration of water in the outer disk,
   leading to enhanced C/O ratios and abundances of organic molecules in
   the inner disk. A comparison of our derived HCN-to-H2O column density
   ratio to comets, hot cores, and outer T Tauri star disks suggests that
   the inner disks are chemically active.}},

   fields of chemical physics. The experimental characterization of highly
   excited vibrational states of this molecular system with a stable HCN
   and a metastable HNC isomer is of special interest. This work
   substantially extends the spectroscopic characterization of the
   rovibrational states of the {[}H,C, N] molecular system around the HNC
   minimum of the potential surface. The emission spectrum of the HNC
   isomer has been recorded at 1463 K using hot gas molecular emission
   (HOTGAME) spectroscopy from the far infrared up to the near infrared
   wavenumber region. The dense emission spectrum was analyzed using the
   spectrum analysis software SyMath (TM) implemented in the Mathematica
   (TM) computer algebra system. This work reports the analysis of highly
   excited rovibrational states. The rotational structure for 27
   vibrational states (0 nu(1)(2)1 states from nu(2) = 4 to nu(2) = 7, the
   0 nu(1)(2)2 from nu(2) =1 to nu(2) = 4 and 2 nu(1)(2)0 states from nu(2)
   = 3 to nu(2) = 4) have been characterized for the first time and for
   five known vibrational levels it was possible to improve the existing
   spectroscopic constants substantially. Together with the author's three
   recent papers accurate spectroscopic constants for 94 HNC rovibrational
   states have been determined. New expansion coefficients for the
   vibrational dependence of the spectroscopic constants are reported from
   the analysis of all these states. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We report here calculated J = 0 vibrational frequenc for (CH2)-C-1
   and HCN with root-mean-square error relative to available measurements
   of 2.0 cm(-1) and 3.2 cm(-1), respectively. These results are obtained
   with DVR calculations with a dense grid on ab initio potential energy
   surfaces (PESs). The ab initio electronic structure calculations
   employed are Davidson-corrected MRCI calculations with double-, triple-,
   and quadruple-zeta basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set
   (CBS) limit. In the (CH2)-C-1 case, Full Cl tests of the Davidson
   correction at small basis set levels lead to a scaling of the correction
   with the bend angle that can be profitably applied at the CBS limit.
   Core-valence corrections are added derived from CCSD(T) calculations
   with and without frozen cores. Relativistic and non-Born-Oppenheimer
   corrections are available for HCN and were applied. CBS limit CCSD(T)
   and CASPT2 calculations with the same basis sets were also tried for
   HCN. The CCSD(T) results are noticeably less accurate than the MRCI
   results while the CASPT2 results are much poorer. The PESs were
   generated automatically using the local interpolative moving
   least-squares method (L-IMLS). A general triatomic code is described
   where the L-IMLS method is interfaced with several common electronic
   structure packages. All PESs were computed with this code running in
   parallel on eight processors. The L-IMLS method provides global and
   local fitting error measures important in automatically growing the PES
   from initial ab initio seed points. The reliability of this approach was
   tested for (CH2)-C-1 by comparing DVR-calculated vibrational levels on
   an L-IMLS ab initio surface with levels generated by an explicit ab
   initio calculation at each DVR grid point. For all levels (similar to
   200) below 20 000 cm(-1), the mean unsigned difference between the
   levels of these two calculations was 0.1 cm(-1), consistent with the
   L-IMLS estimated mean unsigned fitting error of 0.3 cm(-1). All L-IMLS
   PESs used in this work have comparable mean unsigned fitting errors,
   implying that fitting errors have a negligible role in the final errors
   of the computed vibrational levels with experiment. Less than 500 ab
   initio calculations of the energy and gradients are required to achieve
   this level of accuracy.}},

   candidates. Out of 30 targets, 28 are positively identified as carbon
   stars, significantly adding to the known population of optically
   invisible carbon stars in the LMC. We also present spectra for six
   IR-bright stars in or near three clusters in the LMC, identifying four
   of them as carbon stars and two as oxygen-rich supergiants. We analyse
   the molecular bands of C2H2 at 3.1 and 3.8 mu m, HCN at 3.57 mu m, and
   sharp absorption features in the 3.70-3.78 mu m region that we attribute
   to C2H2. There is evidence for a generally high abundance of C2H2 in LMC
   carbon stars, suggestive of high carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratios at
   the low metallicity in the LMC. The low initial metallicity is also
   likely to have resulted in less abundant HCN and CS. The sample of IR
   carbon stars exhibits a range in C2H2:HCN abundance ratio. We do not
   find strong correlations between the properties of the molecular
   atmosphere and circumstellar dust envelope, but the observed differences
   in the strengths and shapes of the absorption bands can be explained by
   differences in excitation temperature. High mass-loss rates and strong
   pulsation would then be seen to be associated with a large scale height
   of the molecular atmosphere.}},

   9600-CM(-1) - SOME NEW TRANSITIONS OF BENDING COMBINATION-MODES}},

Pages = {375-382},
Abstract = {{The transition moments and vibration-rotation constants of 18 previously
   unobserved combination and/or hot bands of (HCN)-C-12-N-14 are reported.
   Overtone absorption spectra were measured with a Fourier transform
   interferometer and a multipass absorption cell with a pathlength of up
   to 352 m. The transition wavenumber measurements were used to derive
   vibration-rotation constants, and the integrated line intensities were
   used to derive an estimate of the transition moments. The new
   transitions are 01(1)3-01(1)0, 11(1)2-00(0)0, 12(0)2-000, 32(0)0-02(0)0,
   32(2)0-02(2)0, 03(1)2-01(1)0, 03(1)2-00(0)0, 13(1)1-01(1)0,

Abstract = {{The rotational transitions of hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) and deuterium
   isocyanide (DNC) in the vibrationally excited states as well as in the
   ground states were observed in the millimeter and submillimeter wave
   region. These compounds were generated in a dc glow discharge plasma
   containing hydrogen (or deuterium), nitrogen, and carbon atoms. The
   stretching vibrational modes, v1 and v3 States, were selectively excited
   in the discharge plasma; on the other hand, the bending mode v2 state
   was thermally populated at the cell temperature. The precise rotational,
   centrifugal distortion and l-type doubling constants were obtained for
   all of the first vibrationally excited states as well as the ground
   states. The experimental equilibrium rotational constants B(e) are 45
   496.7769(45) and 38 207.7217(105) MHz for HNC and DNC, respectively,
   where uncertainties correspond to one standard deviation. The
   equilibrium internuclear distances are also determined to be r(e) (H-N)
   = 0.996 0643 (29) angstrom and r(e) (N=C) = 1.168 3506(16) angstrom.}},

No strong evidence is found for a contribution to the 3-micron band by a continuous absorber (e.g., C3 or grains), but a possible contribution in some cases cannot be ruled out.},
