abstract = {A millimeter wave spectrometer equipped with a free space cell and on-line computer averaging has been employed to measure the absorption spectrum of H12C14N16O in the frequency range from 40 to 300 GHz. For each rotational transition up to J = 11 → 12, all of the l-components of transitions in the following vibrational states have been observed and analyzed: 0000020, 2, 0000031, 3, 00020, 200, and 000(11)0, 2. The method of analysis, carried out on the basis of the Nielsen-Amat formulation of the rotation-vibration interaction in linear molecules, is discussed. The unperturbed rotational constants Bv and Dv as well as several vibration-rotation constants were determined using sum rules valid for each group of perturbed levels and lines. The vibrational anharmonicity constants gltlt′ were determined for the first time from pure rotational transitions. The following constants were obtained: gl5l5(v5=2)=−24.2±3.0 cm−1, gl4l4(v4=2)1.28±0.30 cm−1 gl5l5(v5=3)=−6.24±0.14 cm−1, gl4l5(v5=1; v5=1)=1.63±0.50 cm −1; An interpretation of the results of this analysis, especially for the v5 = 2 and v5 = 3 states, is given. The observed anomalies indicate the presence of a potential function with a hump disturbing the isotropic two-dimensional oscillator potential for ν5, the low-lying degenerate bending mode. In the case of the combination state 000(11)0, 2 the vibrational l-type doubling constants r45(0) = −0.81 ± 1.00 cm−1 and r45(1) = 0.6565 ± 0.0027 \{MHz\} have been evaluated for the first time from millimeter wave rotational transitions. }}
