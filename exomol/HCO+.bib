Title = {Observations and Chemical Modeling of the Isotopologues of Formaldehyde
   and the Cations of Formyl and Protonated Formaldehyde in the Hot
   Molecular Core G331.512-0.103},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {953},
Abstract = {In the interstellar cold gas, the chemistry of formaldehyde (H2CO) can
   be essential to explain the formation of complex organic molecules. On
   this matter, the massive and energetic protostellar object G331 is still
   unexplored; hence, we carried out a comprehensive study of the
   isotopologues of H2CO, the formyl cation (HCO+), and protonated
   formaldehyde (H2COH+) through the APEX observations in a spectral window
   of similar to 159-356 GHz. We employed observational and theoretical
   methods to derive the physical properties of the molecular gas combining
   LTE and non-LTE analyses. Formaldehyde was characterized via 35 lines of
   H2CO, H213 2C(18)O. The formyl cation was detected via eight lines of
   HCO+, (HCO+)-C-13, (HCO+)-O-18, and (HCO+)-O-17. Deuterium was clearly
   detected via HDCO, whereas DCO+ remained undetected. The H2COH+ was
   detected through three clean lines. According to the radiative analysis,
   formaldehyde appears to be embedded in a bulk gas with a wide range of
   temperatures (T`similar to 20-90 K), while HCO+ and H2COH+ are primarily
   associated with colder gas (T -> 30 K). The reaction H2CO+HCO+-> H2COH+
   + CO is crucial for the balance of the three species. We used the
   Nautilus gas-grain code to predict the evolution of their molecular
   abundances relative to H-2; their values at timescales of similar to
   10(3) yr matched the observations in G331: {[}H2CO] = (0.2-2) x 10(-8),
   {[}HCO+] = (0.5-4) x 10(-9), and {[}H2COH+] = (0.2-2) x 10(-10). Based
   on the molecular evolution of H2CO, HCO+, and H2COH+, we hypothesized
   about the young lifetime of G331, which is consistent with the active
   gas-grain chemistry of massive protostellar objects.},

Title = {Ro-vibrationally averaged dipole moments of linear triatomic molecules},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {362},
Pages = {29-36},
Abstract = {We discuss here which of the dipole moment components of a linear
   triatomic molecule (of type A-B-A or A-B-C) will vanish, and which can
   be observed with non-zero values. We aim to resolve some confusion
   arisen in connection with the relationship between vibrationally
   averaged structures and the values of components of the electric dipole
   moment mu. We have previously demonstrated that a linear triatomic
   molecule, whose equilibrium structure is linear, will necessarily be
   observed as being bent on rovibrational average (see J. Mol. Spectrosc.,
   343 (2018) 54-61, and references therein). Accordingly, the b-axis
   component mu(b) attains a non-zero value. However, it is `integrated
   away' when the rotation of the molecule about the a axis is considered;
   the a axis coincides with the molecular axis at the linear geometry.
   Therefore, for triatomic molecules of type A-B-C, with A not equal C,
   only the a-axis component mu(a) survives to be observed in Stark
   experiments, and an A-B-A linear molecule such as CO2 shows zero
   permanent dipole moment on observation. Numerical checks of these
   assertions were successfully done for the linear molecules CO2 and HCO+
   using wavefunctions and dipole moment functions determined ab initio.
   The <mu(a)>(0) value thus calculated for the vibrational ground state of
   (X) over tilde (1)Sigma(+) HCO+ is 3.933 D, which is in good agreement
   with experimental value of 3.922(31) D. The non-zero <mu(b)>(0) value,
   derived theoretically and experimentally for CO2, provides further
   evidence that this linear molecule shows a bent average structure on
   observation. Strategies for comparing experimental and calculated dipole
   moment values are suggested. },
