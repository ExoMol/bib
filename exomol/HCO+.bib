Abstract = {We discuss here which of the dipole moment components of a linear
   triatomic molecule (of type A-B-A or A-B-C) will vanish, and which can
   be observed with non-zero values. We aim to resolve some confusion
   arisen in connection with the relationship between vibrationally
   averaged structures and the values of components of the electric dipole
   moment mu. We have previously demonstrated that a linear triatomic
   molecule, whose equilibrium structure is linear, will necessarily be
   observed as being bent on rovibrational average (see J. Mol. Spectrosc.,
   343 (2018) 54-61, and references therein). Accordingly, the b-axis
   component mu(b) attains a non-zero value. However, it is `integrated
   away' when the rotation of the molecule about the a axis is considered;
   the a axis coincides with the molecular axis at the linear geometry.
   Therefore, for triatomic molecules of type A-B-C, with A not equal C,
   only the a-axis component mu(a) survives to be observed in Stark
   experiments, and an A-B-A linear molecule such as CO2 shows zero
   permanent dipole moment on observation. Numerical checks of these
   assertions were successfully done for the linear molecules CO2 and HCO+
   using wavefunctions and dipole moment functions determined ab initio.
   The <mu(a)>(0) value thus calculated for the vibrational ground state of
   (X) over tilde (1)Sigma(+) HCO+ is 3.933 D, which is in good agreement
   with experimental value of 3.922(31) D. The non-zero <mu(b)>(0) value,
   derived theoretically and experimentally for CO2, provides further
   evidence that this linear molecule shows a bent average structure on
   observation. Strategies for comparing experimental and calculated dipole
   moment values are suggested. },
