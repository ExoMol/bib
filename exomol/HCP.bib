Abstract = {The submillimeter-wave rotational spectra of the unstable
   phosphorus-bearing molecules HCCCP (phosphabutadiyne) and NCCP
   (C-cyanophosphaethyne) have been investigated in selected frequency
   regions between 490 and 815 GHz using the Cologne Terahertz
   Spectrometer. Both molecules were studied in their ground vibrational
   states. Additionally, vibrational satellites within the bending states
   v(4) = 1 and v(5) = 1 were recorded for NCCP. Furthermore, the ground
   state rotational spectra of the C-13 and N-15 isotopomers of NCCP were
   detected in natural abundance. The new measurements allowed us to
   evaluate the sextic centrifugal distortion constants for each isotopomer
   and vibrational state investigated. The pyrolysis reactions, through
   which HCCCP and NCCP were produced in situ, also yielded phosphaethyne,
   HCP, as a by-product. Some transitions of HCP and DCP were recorded in
   their ground vibrational states along with v(2) = 1 vibrational
   satellites of the former.},

Abstract = {A sample of HCP (phosphaethyne) was synthesized by pyrolysis of CH3PCl2
   (dichloromethylphosphane). (HCP)-C-13 was present in natural abundance.
   High resolution spectra were measured with a BRUKER IFS 120 HR Fourier
   transform spectrometer using a 3-m absorption cell, and a White-type
   cell with absorption path lengths up to 19.68 m. The wavenumber regions
   measured were 400-725, 1200-1850 and 2500-3600 cm(-1) with resolutions
   of 0.0018, 0.0024 and 0.0048 cm(-1), respectively. In the lowest
   wavenumber region, the v(2) fundamental band, hotbands from v(2) =
   1,2,3, and v(3) = 1, as well as one Fermi-resonance induced band,
   (v(1)v(2)(2)v(3))=(00(Oe)1)<--(01 O-le), were assigned and analysed. In
   the second region, the fundamental band v(3), its hot band from v(2) =
   1, and the overtone of v(2) and its hot bands could be measured, and in
   the third region, v(1) and its hot bands. The fundamental and overtone
   bands of the bending vibration of (HCP)-C-13, and its hotbands from v(2)
   = 1 and 2, as well as the vi fundamental were also assigned and
   analysed. The bands observed for the first time in this work are: for
   (HCP)-C-12: (011)-(001), (001)-(010), (030)-(020), (011)-(010),
   (040)-(030), and for (HCP)-C-13: (020)-(010), (020)-(000). Spectroscopic
   constants including Fermi resonance parameters for (HCP)-C-12 and
   (HCP)-C-13 of the effective Hamiltonian for linear molecules are given.},

Abstract = {The molecular parameters of phosphaethyne, HCP, have been determined in

   of core correlation on the structural parameters was investigated. The
   equilibrium structure of the molecule was found to be linear, with the
   bond lengths r(HC) = 1.0706 Angstrom and r(CP) = 1.5399 Angstrom. The
   full anharmonic quartic force field was determined. The spectroscopic
   constants of HCP were calculated using perturbation theory and
   accounting for the effects of a Fermi resonance. The calculated
   molecular constants were found to be in excellent agreement with
   experimental data.},

Title = {{Stimulated emission pumping spectroscopy of HCP near the isomerization
   barrier: E(VIB)<=25,315 cm(-1)}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {1996},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {7383-7401},
Abstract = {Rotation-vibration levels in the energy region near the HCP<->HPC (X)
   over tilde(1) Sigma(+) isomerization barrier (i.e., the HPC geometry)
   were observed by HCP (A) over tilde-(X) over tilde and (C) over
   tilde-(X) over tilde stimulated emission pumping (SEP) spectroscopy.
   Unlike HCN<->HNC, where the unstable isomer corresponds to a local
   minimum on the potential energy surface, the HPC isomer corresponds to a
   saddle point. In the (A) over tilde-(X) over tilde SEP spectra, the l=0
   and 2 components of purl bend overtone levels (0,26 less than or equal
   to upsilon(2) less than or equal to 42,0) and the bend-CP stretch
   combination levels, (0,24,1) and (0,26,1), were sampled. On the other
   hand, in the (C) over tilde-(X) over tilde SEP spectra, which sample l=0
   components exclusively, 2 omega(2):1 omega(3) polyads were identified.
   These polyads appeared in the SEP spectra as a regular, easily
   recognizable pattern. Since the (C) over tilde-(X) over tilde SEP
   spectra appeared to be almost totally Franck-Condon nonselective (a
   large fraction of the predicted total density of l=0 levels was
   observed), the polyad pattern was the key to vibrational assignments of
   highly excited vibrational levels. It was found that the bending
   vibration exhibits very regular (Morse-type) behavior up to at least
   upsilon(2)=42. However, an abrupt change was found in the
   upsilon(2)-dependence of all of the vibrational fine structure constants
   above upsilon(2) = 36, E((0,36,0)) = 22 048 cm(-1). In addition, a
   sudden turning on of perturbations in the pure bend overtone levels was
   also observed to occur at upsilon(2)=32. These abrupt changes in the
   level structure could be related to an abrupt change in curvature of the
   potential energy surface along directions perpendicular to the bending
   coordinate when the bending coordinate is far from equilibrium.},

Abstract = {The ground state potential energy surface for HCP has been investigated
   theoretically, A large fraction of electron correlation is included by
   multireference internally contracted configuration interaction from
   CASSCF reference wave functions using large orbital expansions. The
   origin of the potential is then shifted and the force constants scaled
   to reproduce all spectroscopic data available for the four isotopically
   substituted species. Variational calculations of vibrational and
   rotational frequencies for transitions up to J = 7 <-- 6 have finally
   been performed, with accuracy which is typically +/- 5 cm(-1) for
   vibrations and +/- 10 MHz for most rotations. By comparison with the
   results of the perturbation treatment the importance of the nu(1):2
   nu(3) Fermi interaction for vibrational frequencies and effective
   rotational constants has been determined. From computed and experimental
   ground state rotational constants, the molecular equilibrium geometry
   has also been estimated.},
