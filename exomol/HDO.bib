Abstract = {A non-linear spectroscopic study of the HDO molecule is performed in the
   wavelength range of 1.36-1.42 mu m using noise-immune cavity-enhanced
   optical-heterodyne molecular spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS). More than 100
   rovibrational Lamb dips are recorded, with an experimental precision of
   2-20 kHz, related to the first overtone of the O-H stretch fundamental
   of HD16O and HD18O. Significant perturbations, including distortions,
   shifts, and splittings, have been observed for a number of Lamb dips.
   These spectral perturbations are traced back to an AC-Stark effect,
   arising due to the strong laser field applied in all
   saturation-spectroscopy experiments. The AC-Stark effect mixes parity
   pairs, that is pairs of rovibrational states whose assignment differs
   solely in the Kc quantum number, where Kc is part of the standard JKa,Kc
   asymmetric-top rotational label. Parity-pair mixing seems to be
   especially large for parity pairs with Ka >= 3, whereby their energy
   splittings become as small as a few MHz, resulting in multi-component
   asymmetric Lamb-dip profiles of gradually increasing complexity. These
   complex profiles often include crossover resonances. This effect is well
   known in saturation spectroscopy, but has not been reported in
   combination with parity-pair mixing. Parity-pair mixing is not seen in
   H216O and H 18 2 O, because their parity pairs correspond to ortho and
   para nuclear-spin isomers, whose interaction is prohibited. Despite the
   frequency shifts observed for HD16O and HD18O, the absolute accuracy of
   the detected transitions still exceeds that achievable by
   Doppler-limited techniques. },

abstract = {A new spectroscopically determined potential energy surface (PES)
	for (HDO)-O-16 is presented. This surface is constructed by adjusting
	the high accuracy ab initio PES of Polyansky {[}Science 299, 539
	(2003)] by fitting to both published experimental data and our still
	unpublished data. This refinement used experimentally derived term
	values up to 25 000 {cm$^{-1}$} and with J <= 8: a data set of 3478 energy
	levels once some levels with ambiguous assignment is excluded. To
	improve the extrapolation properties of the empirical PES, the restraint
	that the resulting PESs remain close to the ab initio surface was
	imposed. The new HDO\_07 PES reproduces the experimental data, including
	high J levels not included in the fit, with a root mean square error
	of 0.035 {cm$^{-1}$}. Predictions for rotation-vibration term values up
	to J=12 are made.},
