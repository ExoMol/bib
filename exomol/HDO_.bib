  abstract = {A new spectroscopically determined potential energy surface (PES)
	for (HDO)-O-16 is presented. This surface is constructed by adjusting
	the high accuracy ab initio PES of Polyansky {[}Science 299, 539
	(2003)] by fitting to both published experimental data and our still
	unpublished data. This refinement used experimentally derived term
	values up to 25 000 {cm$^{-1}$} and with J <= 8: a data set of 3478 energy
	levels once some levels with ambiguous assignment is excluded. To
	improve the extrapolation properties of the empirical PES, the restraint
	that the resulting PESs remain close to the ab initio surface was
	imposed. The new HDO\_07 PES reproduces the experimental data, including
	high J levels not included in the fit, with a root mean square error
	of 0.035 {cm$^{-1}$}. Predictions for rotation-vibration term values up
	to J=12 are made.},

	the entire temperature range that are of importance for astrophysics.
	The line list can be used for deuterium-rich environments, such as
	the atmosphere of Venus, and to construct a possible `deuterium test'
	to distinguish brown dwarfs from planetary mass objects.},
