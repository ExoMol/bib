	abstract = {The nuclear hyperfine structure constants and the electric dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride, H1F19, in the ground-vibration and first excited rotation state have been measured in a molecular beam electric resonance experiment. The hfs constants are: cF=307.6±1.5 kc/sec, cp=-70.6±1.3 kc/sec, 25gpgF𝜇nm2h⟨r3⟩=57.6±0.44 kc/sec. The apparatus was calibrated by observing Stark transitions in the ground-vibration and first excited rotation state of carbonyl sulfide, O16C12S32, which gave 𝜇HF𝜇OCS=2.554±0.0037, or 𝜇HF=1.8195±0.0026 D, by using 𝜇OCS=0.7124±0.0002 D. An absolute measurement of the OCS electric dipole moment gave 𝜇OCS=0.7120±0.003 D. A digitally computed solution of the Stark effect with magnetic hyperfine structure was necessary to interpret the data. The theory and experiment are in good agreement over the range of electric-field strengths used in the experiment. The hfs constants are in excellent agreement with the averaged absolute values of these constants as measured in a molecular beam magnetic resonance experiment. The agreement has significance because of discrepancies between the results from the two resonance methods, for some other molecules, in previous experiments.},

Title = {The fluorine abundance in a Galactic bulge AGB star measured from CRIRES
   spectra},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {682},
Pages = {509-514},
Abstract = {We present measurements of the fluorine abundance in a Galactic bulge
   asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The measurements were performed
   using high-resolution K-band spectra obtained with the CRIRES
   spectrograph, which has been recently installed at ESO's VLT, together
   with state-of-the-art model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. This
   represents the first fluorine abundance measurement in a Galactic bulge
   star, and one of few measurements of this kind in a third dredge-up
   oxygen-rich AGB star. The F abundance is found to be close to the solar
   value scaled down to the metallicity of the star, and in agreement with
   disk giants that are comparable to the bulge giant studied here. The
   measurement is of astrophysical interest also because the star's mass
   can be estimated rather accurately (1.4 less than or similar to
   M/M-circle dot less than or similar to 2.0). AGB nucleosynthesis models
   predict only a very mild enrichment of F in such low mass AGB stars.
   Thus, we suggest that the fluorine abundance found in the studied star
   is representative for the star's natal cloud, and that fluorine must
   have been produced at a similar level in the bulge and in the disk.},

abstract = {Absolute cross sectional measurements are reported of the valence-shell dipole excitation spectrum of HF obtained from suitably calibrated high impact energy, small momentum transfer, electron energy-loss scattering intensities. Detailed assignments are provided of all prominent features observed on the basis of concomitant single- and coupled-channel RPAE calculations. The measured spectrum, obtained at an energy resolution of = 0.06 eV (fwhm) in the = 9 to 21 eV interval, includes a dissociative feature centered at = 10.35 eV assigned as X1Σ+ → (1π−14σ)A1Π, as well as numerous strong, sharp bands in the = 13 to 16 eV excitation energy region. These bands are attributed on basis of the present calculations to Rydberg (1π−1 npπ)-valence (3σ−14σ) mixing in X1Σ+ → 1Σ+ excitation symmetry, which gives rise to a long conventional progression, and to strong 1π → nsσ, moderate 1π → ndσ, and weak 1π → npσ Rydberg series in X1Σ+ → 1Π excitation symmetry. A weaker 1π → ndπ Rydberg series also contributes to the spectrum in X1Σ+ → 1Σ+ symmetry. The calculated and measured excitation energies and f numbers, particularly for the X1Σ → (1π−14σ)A1Π, → (1π−13pπ)B1Σ+, → (1π−13sσ)C1Π, and → (3σ−14σ)D1Σ+ transitions, are in good quantitative accord, suggesting that the overall nature of the HF spectrum is generally clarified on basis of the present studies. Finally, tentative assignments are provided of weak features observed above the 1π−1 ionization threshold. As in previously reported joint experimental and theoretical studies of the valence-shell spectrum of F2, high-resolution optical VUV measurements and calculated potential energy curves aid in the assignment and clarification of the HF spectrum.}
