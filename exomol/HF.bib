Title = {{The ESO SupJup Survey VI. <SUP>12</SUP>C/<SUP>13</SUP>C isotope ratio
   comparison of three L-type brown dwarfs}},

Abstract = {Context. Recent research suggests that the distinct formation processes
   of exoplanets and brown dwarfs may have an influence on the chemical and
   isotopic composition of their atmospheres. Variations in the carbon
   C-12/C-13 isotope ratio have been observed and tentatively linked to the
   top-down formation of brown dwarfs and the core accretion pathway of
   super-Jupiters. The ESO SupJup Survey, conducted with CRIRES+ on the
   Very Large Telescope, aims to characterise the atmospheres of young
   brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters, specifically by investigating the
   C-12/C-13 ratio as a tracer of their formation pathways. Aims. We
   present the atmospheric characterisation of three isolated L-type brown
   dwarfs (2MASS J08354256-0819237, 2MASS J05012406-0010452, and 2MASS
   J05002100+0330501) included in the ESO SupJup Survey. We aim to
   constrain the C/O and C-12/C-13 ratios, and investigate whether the
   oxygen O-16/O-18 isotope ratio can be probed. Methods. We analysed the
   CRIRES+ K-band spectra of the three targets using our atmospheric
   retrieval framework. This framework couples the radiative transfer code
   petitRADTRANS with the sampling algorithm MultiNest. Results. We report
   C-12/C-13 ratios of 89(-11)(+11) and 117(-17)(+20) for J0835 and J0500
   with strong (CO)-C-13 significance (>6.5 sigma) and a tentative (3
   sigma) detection of (CO)-C-13 for J0501, resulting in a carbon isotope
   ratio of 155(-53)(+56). Only a weak detection of the (H2O)-O-18 isotope
   was found in J0835. The C/O ratios are found to be in the range 0.65 to
   0.71 for the three targets, and all exhibit strong detections of HF.
   Conclusions. The C-12/C-13 ratios appear to be higher than that of the
   interstellar medium.},

abstract = {Hydrogen fluoride (HF) has served as a benchmark molecule for ab initio methods. Consequently, it has been extensively investigated in the past few decades. The energy ordering of the low-lying triplet electronic states has proven controversial in previous computational studies. In this work, the Gaussian basis of F and H atoms are calibrated by adding diffuse functions to the aug-cc-pV5Z valence basis sets. The electronic structure of HF molecule is studied by the multireference configuration interaction method plus Davidson correction method (MRCI+Q). The potential energy curves (PECs) of 19 electronic states are computed, and the spectroscopic constants of the bound states are determined. The low-lying triplet Rydberg electronic states 23Σ+ (3Σ+R1), 23Π (3ΠR1) and 13Δ (3ΔR1) are characterized and compared with the previous computational results. The transition dipole moments (TDMs) and Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) between the electronic states are subsequently calculated. Finally, the spontaneous radiative lifetimes of four spin-allowed transitions are obtained. The results of this paper will improve the understanding on the electronic excited states of HF molecule, especially the electronic structure and spectra characteristics of the triplet excited states.}

Title = {The fluorine abundance in a Galactic bulge AGB star measured from CRIRES
   spectra},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {682},
Pages = {509-514},
Abstract = {We present measurements of the fluorine abundance in a Galactic bulge
   asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The measurements were performed
   using high-resolution K-band spectra obtained with the CRIRES
   spectrograph, which has been recently installed at ESO's VLT, together
   with state-of-the-art model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. This
   represents the first fluorine abundance measurement in a Galactic bulge
   star, and one of few measurements of this kind in a third dredge-up
   oxygen-rich AGB star. The F abundance is found to be close to the solar
   value scaled down to the metallicity of the star, and in agreement with
   disk giants that are comparable to the bulge giant studied here. The
   measurement is of astrophysical interest also because the star's mass
   can be estimated rather accurately (1.4 less than or similar to
   M/M-circle dot less than or similar to 2.0). AGB nucleosynthesis models
   predict only a very mild enrichment of F in such low mass AGB stars.
   Thus, we suggest that the fluorine abundance found in the studied star
   is representative for the star's natal cloud, and that fluorine must
   have been produced at a similar level in the bulge and in the disk.},

journal = CP,
year = {1984},

abstract = {Absolute cross sectional measurements are reported of the valence-shell
dipole excitation spectrum of HF obtained from suitably calibrated high impact energy,
small momentum transfer, electron energy-loss scattering intensities. Detailed assignments
are provided of all prominent features observed on the basis of concomitant single-
and coupled-channel RPAE calculations. The measured spectrum, obtained at an energy
resolution of = 0.06 eV (fwhm) in the = 9 to 21 eV interval, includes a dissociative
feature centered at = 10.35 eV assigned as X1Σ+ → (1π−14σ)A1Π, as well as numerous
strong, sharp bands in the = 13 to 16 eV excitation energy region. These bands are
attributed on basis of the present calculations to Rydberg (1π−1 npπ)-valence (3σ−14σ)
mixing in X1Σ+ → 1Σ+ excitation symmetry, which gives rise to a long conventional
progression, and to strong 1π → nsσ, moderate 1π → ndσ, and weak 1π → npσ Rydberg
series in X1Σ+ → 1Π excitation symmetry. A weaker 1π → ndπ Rydberg series also
contributes to the spectrum in X1Σ+ → 1Σ+ symmetry. The calculated and measured
excitation energies and f numbers, particularly for the X1Σ → (1π−14σ)A1Π, → (1π−13pπ)B1Σ+, → (1π−13sσ)C1Π,
and → (3σ−14σ)D1Σ+ transitions, are in good quantitative accord, suggesting that
the overall nature of the HF spectrum is generally clarified on basis of the present
studies. Finally, tentative assignments are provided of weak features observed
above the 1π−1 ionization threshold. As in previously reported joint experimental
and theoretical studies of the valence-shell spectrum of F2, high-resolution optical
VUV measurements and calculated potential energy curves aid in the assignment
and clarification of the HF spectrum.},
