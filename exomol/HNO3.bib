Title = {New Analysis of the 1.13 and 7.14 Bands of HNO3 in the 7.6 mu m Region},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {13236-13248},
Abstract = {A new line position analysis of the v3 and v, bands of nitric acid
   (FINO3) at 1326.186 and 1303.072 cm(-1) together with its associated
   interacting bands is presented. The 31 and 41 energy levels were
   obtained, from an extended analysis of high-resolution Fourier transform
   spectra recorded at Giessen in the 7.6 pm region. The energy levels of
   31 and 41 upper states of nitric acid are strongly interacting with
   those of the 93, 62, 5191, and 7181 dark states centered at 1288.899,
   1289.46, 1341.05, and 1343.78 cm-1, respectively. Informations on these
   perturbing dark states were achieved through previous partial
   investigations of hot bands in high-resolution Fourier transform spectra
   recorded at 22 pm in Giessen (for 31192v9 and 3119-115), at 12 pm in
   Denver (for 3v(9)-v(9)), and at 11 pm in Orsay (for v(s)+v(9)-v(9)). The
   energy levels calculation accounts for the various Fermi, anharmonic,
   A-type, B-type, and C-type Coriolis resonances, which couple together
   the \{62,93,41,31,5191,7.181\} interacting energy levels. For nitric
   acid, the 119 mode (OH torsion relative to the NO2 moiety) is a large
   amplitude motion. The theoretical model used in this work accounts also
   for large amplitude effects in the 93 dark state, which lead to a
   splitting of the 93 energy levels of about 0.060 cm(-1). In this way,
   the existence of torsional splittings for several v, perturbed lines was
   explained by the occurrence of local A-type and B-type Coriolis
   resonances coupling the 41 energy levels with those of 9(3) Because four
   dark bands had to be accounted for in the model, the results of the
   energy level calculations are reasonable, although not perfect. However,
   a very significant improvement was achieved in terms of understanding
   the 7.6 pm absorbing bands of nitric acid as compared to the analysis of
   the 113 and 114 bands performed several years ago {[}Pen-in, A.;
   Lado-Bordowski, O.; Valentin, A. Mot Phys. 1989, 67, 249-267]. Finally,
   the present analysis also features, for the first time, the
   v(3)+v(9)-v(9) hot band located at 1331.09 cm(-1). This study will help
   to improve HNO3 measurements by satellites. This will be indeed the case
   for the ``Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer{''} (/ASI)
   experiment.},

Abstract = {Previously, a reduced dimensionality approach was used to determine the
   vibrational contribution to nonlinear optical properties for molecules
   with large amplitude anharmonic modes that takes into account tunneling
   between potential wells (Luis, J.M.; Reis, H.; Papadopoulos, M.G.;
   Kirtman, B.J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 131, 034116). Here, the treatment is
   extended, again using ammonia as an example, to include the remaining
   modes at several approximate levels. It is shown that this extension is
   essential to obtaining the correct results. Our new approach fully
   accounts for tunneling and avoids possible convergence problems
   associated with the normal coordinate expansion of the potential energy
   surface in a single-well treatment. For accurate numerical values, a
   good treatment of electron correlation is required along with a flexible
   basis set including diffuse functions.},

Title = {Solving the vibrational Schrodinger equation using bases pruned to
   include strongly coupled functions and compatible quadratures},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {137},
Abstract = {In this paper, we present new basis pruning schemes and compatible
   quadrature grids for solving the vibrational Schroumldinger equation.
   The new basis is designed to include the product basis functions coupled
   by the largest terms in the potential and important for computing
   low-lying vibrational levels. To solve the vibrational Schrodinger
   equation without approximating the potential, one must use quadrature to
   compute potential matrix elements. For a molecule with more than five
   atoms, the use of iterative methods is imperative, due to the size of
   the basis and the quadrature grid. When using iterative methods in
   conjunction with quadrature, it is important to evaluate matrix-vector
   products by doing sums sequentially. This is only possible if both the
   basis and the grid have structure. Although it is designed to include
   only functions coupled by the largest terms in the potential, the new
   basis and also the quadrature for doing integrals with the basis have
   enough structure to make efficient matrix-vector products possible. When
   results obtained with a multimode approximation to the potential are
   accurate enough, full-dimensional quadrature is not necessary. Using the
   quadrature methods of this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of
   calculations made by making multimode approximations. (C) 2012 American

   various depths below the surface. Further aspects concern the molecular

   proton transfer to produce a solvent-separated ion pair from that

Abstract = {The analysis of the rotational spectrum of HNO3 has been extended to
   include the upsilon(8) = upsilon(9) = 1 state at 1205.7 cm(-1) and the
   upsilon(6) = upsilon(7) = 1 state at 1223.4 cm(-1). Based on 78-519 GHz
   data, the assignments in the 8191 vibrational state have been
   significantly expanded from the previously reported microwave
   measurements {[}T.M. Goyette, F.C. De Lucia, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 139
   (1990) 241-243]. A new microwave analysis is also reported for the
   6(1)7(1) vibrational state. A simultaneous analysis takes into account
   the localized Delta K-a = +/-2 Fermi resonances between the vibrational
   states, describes the torsional splitting of 3.3 and 1.4 MHz for the
   8191 and 6171 states respectively, and fits to experimental accuracy

   experimental accuracy. Measurement of strongly perturbed transitions in
   each vibrational state provide a determination of the band origin
   difference of 17.733184(17) cm(-1). The rotational constants agree well
   with those predicted by vibrational-rotational constants of the
   fundamental modes. Furthermore, the analysis will provide a very

   the HITRAN spectroscopic database have recently been revisited in the
   interval corresponding to the WAS spectral range. For the 11.3 mu m

   to solve some of these problems. Based on the analysis of N-2-broadened

Pages = {99-107},
Abstract = {The quadratic, cubic and semi-diagonal quartic force field of nitric
   acid has been calculated at the CCSD(T) level of theory employing a
   basis set of triple-zeta quality. A semi-experimental equilibrium
   structure has been derived from experimental ground state rotational
   constants and rovibrational interaction parameters calculated from the
   ab initio force field. It is found that the A and B semi-experimental
   equilibrium rotational constants of the (18)O isotopologues (for which
   the rotation of principal axes is large) cannot be accurately
   reproduced. This problem is discussed and a remedy is proposed. Finally,
   the semi-experimental structure is in agreement with the ab initio
   structure calculated at the CCSD(T) level of theory using a basis set of
   at least quadruple-zeta quality and a core correlation correction,
   except for the long N-O single bond for which the CCSD(T) value is too
   short due to inadequate treatment of electron correlation. The empirical
   structures are also determined and their accuracy is discussed. The best
   equilibrium structure is: r(e)(N=O(syn)) = 1.209(1) angstrom,

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {110},
Pages = {6886-6897},
Abstract = {Although heterogeneous chemistry on surfaces in the troposphere is known
   to be important, there are currently only a few techniques available for
   studying the nature of surface-adsorbed species as well as their
   chemistry and photochemistry under atmospheric conditions of 1 atm
   pressure and in the presence of water vapor. We report here a new
   laboratory approach using a combination of long path Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR) and attenuated total reflectance (ATR)
   FTIR that allows the simultaneous observation and measurement of gases
   and surface species. Theory is used to identify the surface-adsorbed
   intermediates and products, and to estimate their relative
   concentrations. At intermediate relative humidities typical of the
   tropospheric boundary layer, the nitric acid formed during NO2
   heterogeneous hydrolysis is shown to exist both as nitrate ions from the
   dissociation of nitric acid formed on the surface and as molecular
   nitric acid. In both cases, the ions and HNO3 are complexed to water
   molecules. Upon pumping, water is selectively removed, shifting the
   NO3-HNO3(H2O)(y) equilibria toward more dehydrated forms of HNO3 and
   ultimately to nitric acid dimers. Irradiation of the nitric acid-water
   film using 300-400 nm radiation generates gaseous NO, while irradiation
   at 254 nm generates both NO and HONO, resulting in conversion of
   surface-adsorbed nitrogen oxides into photochemically active NOx. These
   studies suggest that the assumption that deposition or formation of
   nitric acid provides a permanent removal mechanism from the atmosphere
   may not be correct. Furthermore, a potential role of surface-adsorbed
   nitric acid and other species formed during the heterogeneous hydrolysis
   of NO2 in the oxidation of organics on surfaces, and in the generation
   of gas-phase HONO on local to global scales, should be considered.},

Abstract = {Nitric acid (HNO3) plays an important role in the Earth's atmosphere as
   a reservoir molecule of NO, species. It has a strong infrared signature
   at 11 mu m which is one of the most commonly used for the infrared
   retrieval of this species in the atmosphere since this spectral region
   coincides with an atmospheric window. It is therefore essential to have
   high quality spectral parameters in this spectral region. For the
   (HNO3)-N-14 (main) isotopic species, the 11 mu m bands were already the
   subject of numerous extensive studies which involve not only the nu(5)
   and 2 nu(9) cold bands but also the first hot bands. The present work is
   the first high resolution Fourier transform analysis of the 11 mu m
   bands for (HNO3)-N-15, which is the second most abundant isotopomer of
   nitric acid {[}a congruent to 0.00365(7)]. In this way, the analysis of

   and 9(2) rotational levels. The theoretical model that we used to
   compute the line positions and line intensities is directly issued from
   the one which we used recently for (HNO3)-N-14 {[}A. Perrin, J. Orphal,
   J.-M. Flaud, S. Klee, G. Mellau, H. Mader. D. Walbrodt, M. Winnewisser,
   J. Mol. Spectrosc. 228 (2004) 375-391]. Actually, for the (HNO3)-N-15
   line positions, the Hamiltonian matrix accounts for the rather strong
   Fermi and the weaker Coriolis interactions linking the 5(1)double left
   right arrow 9(2) rotational levels. Using this model which accounts
   correctly for the strong mixing of the 5(1) and 9(2) upper state energy
   levels, the nu(5) and 2 nu(9) line intensities for (HNO3)-N-15 were
   satisfactorily computed using the nu(5) and 2 nu(9) transition moment
   operators achieved previously for the N-14 (main) isotopic species. In
   this way. the transfer of intensities from the nu(5) fundamental (and
   presumably strong) band to the 2 nu(9) overtone (and presumably weak)
   band could be explained for (HNO3)-N-15 as it was done previously for
   the N-14 (main) isotopic species. Finally, the position of the
   (HNO)-N-15 nu(5) + nu(9) - nu(9) hot band was identified at 875.245
   cm(-1). },

Abstract = {The rotational spectra of the first three vibrational states of nitric
   acid above 1000 cm(-1), 7(1)9(1), 6(1)9(1), and 7(2), have been measured
   and analyzed. The 7(2) state, along with the previously published 7(1)
   state, show the rotational and centrifugal distortional constants have a
   near linear dependence on the nu(7) vibrational quantum number. Large
   changes for several centrifugal distortion constants of the nu(7) = n
   series of states are attributed to a c-type Coriolis resonance manifold
   between the nu(7) and nu(6) vibrational modes and the Hamiltonian
   reduction and representation used to fit the spectra. The 7(1)9(1) and
   6(1)9(1) states have torsional splittings of 12.361(8) and 22.47(1) MHz,
   respectively. These splittings are large compared to 2.340(8) MHz of the
   9(1) state and can be explained by a similar to 1-2\% mixing through
   anharmonic Fermi resonances with the 9(3) state, which has a large
   torsional splitting of similar to 1760 MHz. The
   millimeter/submillimeter-wave spectrum of each state was fit separately
   to the experimental uncertainty of the measurements. The resultant
   rotational constants, distortional constants and inertial defects agree
   well with DFT calculations.},

   millimeter wave techniques: line positions and intensities},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {228},
Pages = {375-391},
Abstract = {Nitric acid (HNO3) plays an important role in the Earth's atmosphere as
   a reservoir molecule of NOx species. It has a strong infrared signature
   at 11 mum which is one of the most commonly used for the infrared
   retrieval of this species in the atmosphere since this spectral region
   coincides with an atmospheric window. It is therefore essential to have
   high quality spectral parameters in this spectral region. The main goal
   of this work is then to generate as reliable as possible line positions
   and intensities for the nu(5) and 2nu(9) cold bands centered at 879.1075
   and 896.4467 cm(-1), respectively. In particular the existing line
   parameters need improvement in the wings of the 11 mum window in order
   to retrieve more accurately the CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2)
   atmospheric species at similar to850 and similar to920 cm(-1).
   respectively. This work is also motivated by theoretical considerations.
   Very strong resonances couple indeed the 5(1) and 9(2) rotational
   levels. In addition the nu(9) mode (OH torsion) is a ``large
   amplitude{''} motion, and torsional splittings affect both the nu(9) = 2
   and the nu(5) = 1 rotational transitions. In the present study, these
   effects are accounted for simultaneously both for the line position and
   line intensity calculations. To calculate the line positions the
   Hamiltonian matrix accounts for the very strong Fermi and the weaker
   Coriolis interactions linking the 5(1) double left right arrow 9(2)
   rotational levels, and the torsional effects are accounted for within
   the frame of the IAM (Internal Axis Method) approach. In addition, the
   nu-diagonal blocks involve non-orthorhombic operators together with
   Watson's type rotational operators. This means that the z-quantization
   axis deviates from the a inertial axis for both the 5(1) and 9(2)
   vibrational states. The line intensity calculations were performed
   accounting also for the axis switching effects. As far as the
   experimental line positions are concerned we have used the millimeter
   wave data available in the literature {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc., 175 (1996)
   395; J. Mol. Spectrosc., 208 (2001) 121; and references therein], as
   well as new centimeter wave measurements performed in Kiel and new
   Fourier transform infrared spectra recorded in Giessen. For the line
   intensities we have used an extensive set of individual line intensities
   measured recently {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc., 218 (2003) 15 1]. All these
   experimental data were very satisfactorily reproduced using the
   theoretical model described above and an improved set of line positions
   and intensities was generated for the nu(5) and 2nu(9) bands allowing
   one to better model the HNO3 absorption in the 11 mum spectral domain.

Abstract = {We have investigated whether the v(4) feature of NH4+ is a viable
   candidate for the 6.85 mum absorption band seen towards embedded young
   stellar objects. To produce NH4+ astrophysical ice analogs consisting of
   H2O, CO2, NH3 and O-2 were UV photolysed. The IR spectra reveal peaks
   that are identified with the NH4+, NO2-, NO3- and HCO3- ions. It is
   shown that the NH4+ matches two absorption features that are observed
   towards embedded young stellar objects, i.e., the strong 6.85 mum
   feature and the 3.26 mum feature. The characteristic redshift with
   temperature of the interstellar 6.85 pm feature is well reproduced. The
   abundance of NH4+ in interstellar ices would be typically 10\% relative
   to H2O. The experiments show that the counterions produce little
   distinct spectral signature but rather a pseudo-continuum if a variety
   of them is present in a H2O dominated environment. The anions could
   therefore go undetected in IR spectra of interstellar ice. In the ISM,
   where additional mechanisms such as surface chemistry and additional
   elements such as sulfur are available many acids and an even wider
   variety of anions could be produced. These components may be detectable
   once the ices sublime, e.g., in hot cores.},

   More than 4800 lines were assigned in the nu(8) + nu(9) band, which

   nonnegligible B-type transitions could be clearly identified among the
   much stronger A-type lines. Accordingly, a set of individual line

Abstract = {Numerous studies of HNO3 spectra have been performed recently in the
   infrared, far infrared or microwave regions leading to very significant
   improvements in the quantitative spectral parameters of HNO3, i.e. line
   positions and line intensities. The present paper will sumarize recent
   results concerning either isolated or interacting infrared bands of HNO3
   of atmospheric interest. These bands are indeed used for the atmospheric
   detection of HNO3 by infrared methods. Also, the torsional splitting
   which affects mainly the nu(9) = n states, and which is due to the large
   amplitude torsional motion of the OH band relative to the O-NO2 frame
   will be described. },

Journal = JMS,
Year = {1995},
Volume = {172},
Pages = {352-368},
Abstract = {In an attempt to account for the large-amplitude torsional v(y) mode of
   nitric acid, a formalism is set up, based on an
   internal-axis-method-like approach previously developed for high-barrier
   tunneling problems. This formalism is applied to the calculation of the
   tunneling-rotational-vibrational energy of the interacting v(9) = 2 and
   v(5) = 1 vibrational states and accounts for the relational dependence
   of the tunneling splitting and for the strong Coriolis and Fermi
   resonances between these two vibrational states. With the help of this
   formalism, it is shown that the effects of the large-amplitude motion
   may be very different depending on the way the rotational states are
   clustered. For large K-a values, shifts of about 0.001 cm(-1) are
   predicted, while splittings of roughly the same value occur for large
   K-c values. This formalism is used to carry out a simultaneous analysis
   of the microwave data relevant to the two vibrational states (Goyette et
   al., J. Mol. iol. Spectrosc. 167, 365-374. 1994) and of the infrared
   transitions belonging to the 2v(9) and v(5) bands (Perrin et al., J.
   Mol. Spectrosc. 157, 112-1211 1993). The frequency of the microwave
   transitions and the wavenumber of the infrared transitions are
   satisfactorily reproduced and it is possible to point out the effects of
   the large-amplitude motion in the latter data set. },

Abstract = {The rotational spectrum of DNO3 in the ground vibrational state has been
   investigated in the region 16-40 GHz and analysed to give rotational
   constants and centrifugal distortion constants. Microwave data for eight
   isotopomers of HNO3 have been used to derive the zero-point average
   structure after the necessary vibrational corrections: r(O-H)=0.941(3)
   angstrom, r(N-OH)=1.410(2) angstrom, r(N-O)syn=1.213(2) angstrom,

   For comparison, zero-point average structures for the two conformers of

   Inertial defect calculations demonstrate all three molecules to be
   strictly planar in the ground vibrational state. In each case for the
   parent and deuterated species, the inertial defect for the average

Pages = {650-657},
Abstract = {The equilibrium structure and infrared spectrum of HNO3 (nitric acid)
   and its protonated forms have been determined using double-zeta plus
   polarization and triple-zeta plus double polarization basis sets in
   conjunction with several ab initio electronic structure methods. 
   Namely, the self-consistent field (SCF), second order Moller-Plesset
   perturbation theory (MP2), and the single and double excitation
   coupled-cluster (CCSD) methods have been used.  Results using the
   CCSD(T) method, which includes a perturbational estimate of the effects
   of connected triple excitations, are also presented.  Accurate energy
   differences have been determined by computing CCSD(T) energies using
   large atomic natural orbital basis sets.  Four different isomers of
   H2NO3(4) have been investigated, and it is found that the lowest energy
   form of protonated nitric acid corresponds to a complex between H2O and
   NO2+, consistent with earlier theoretical and experimental studies. 
   There are two isomers of the complex, differing by rotation of H2O
   relative to NO2+, that are very close energetically (DELTA-E < 0.5
   kcal/mol), although only the planar form is found to be a minimum on the
   potential energy surface.  The other two isomers of H2NO3+ that have
   been investigated both correspond to local minima on the potential
   energy surface and are very close in energy.  These two isomers are
   about 20 kcal/mol less stable than the complex.  The proton affinity of
   nitric acihan the recent experimental estimate of Cacace et al. (168 +/- 3
   kcal/mod is computed to be 182.5 +/- 4.0 kcal/mol, which is somewhat
   larger tl).  The binding energy of the complex is determined to be 17.3
   +/- 2.0 kcal/mol.},

Title = {{Infrared overtone spectroscopy and vibrational analysis of a Fermi
   resonance in nitric acid: Experiment and theory}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{125}},
pages = {074310},
Abstract = {{High resolution infrared spectra of nitric acid have been recorded in
   the first OH overtone region under jet-cooled conditions using a
   sequential IR-UV excitation method. Vibrational bands observed at
   6933.39(3), 6938.75(4), and 6951.985(3) cm(-1) (origins) with relative
   intensities of 0.42(1), 0.38(1), and 0.20(1) are attributed to strongly
   mixed states involved in a Fermi resonance. A vibrational deperturbation
   analysis suggests that the optically bright OH overtone stretch (2
   nu(1)) at 6939.2(1) cm(-1) is coupled directly to the nu(1)+2 nu(2)
   state at 6946.4(1) cm(-1) and indirectly to the 3 nu(2)+nu(3)+nu(7)
   state at 6938.5(1) cm(-1). Both the identity of the zero-order states
   and the indirect coupling scheme are deduced from complementary CCSD(T)
   calculations in conjunction with second-order vibrational perturbation
   theory. The deperturbation analysis also yields the experimental
   coupling between 2 nu(1) and nu(1)+2 nu(2) of -6.9(1) cm(-1), and that
   between the two dark states of +5.0(1) cm(-1). The calculated
   vibrational energies and couplings are in near quantitative agreement
   with experimentally derived values except for a predicted twofold
   stronger coupling of 2 nu(1) to nu(1)+2 nu(2). Weaker coupling of the
   strongly mixed states to a dense background of vibrational states via
   intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution is evident from the
   experimental linewidths of 0.08 and 0.25 cm(-1) for the higher energy
   and two overlapping lower energy bands, respectively. A comprehensive
   rotational analysis of the higher energy band yields spectroscopic
   parameters and the direction of the OH overtone transition dipole
   moment. }},

   spectrum of nitric acid},
Journal = JCP},

Volume = {142},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Rotation-vibration spectra of the nitric acid molecule, HNO3(,) are
   calculated for wavenumbers up to 7000 cm(-1). Calculations are performed
   using a Hamiltonian expressed in internal curvilinear vibrational
   coordinates employing a hybrid variational-perturbation method. An
   initial potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment function (DMF)
   are calculated ab initio at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ level of theory.
   Parameters of the PES and DMF are varied to minimize differences between
   the calculated and experimental transition frequencies and intensities.
   The average, absolute deviation between calculated and experimental
   values is 0.2 cm(-1) for frequencies in the fundamental bands and 0.4
   cm(-1) for those in the first overtone and lowest combination bands. For
   the intensities, the calculated and experimental values differ by 0.3\%
   and 40\% for the fundamentals and overtones, respectively. The optimized
   PES and DMF are used to calculate the room-temperature ro-vibrational
   spectrum. These calculation reproduce both the form of the absorption
   bands and fine details of the observed spectra, including the rotational
   structure of the vibrational bands and the numerous hot absorption band.
   Many of these hot bands are found to be missing from the compilation in
   HITRAN. A room temperature line list comprising 2 x 10(9) lines is
   computed. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract ={Nitric acid is a possible biomarker in the atmospheres of exoplanets. An accurate line list of rotational and rotational–vibrational transitions is computed for nitric acid (HNO3). This line list covers wavelengths longer than 1.42 μm (0–7000 cm−1) and temperatures up to 500 K. The line list is computed using a hybrid variational – perturbation theory and empirically tuned potential energy and dipole surfaces. It comprises almost seven billion transitions involving rotations up to J = 100. Comparisons with spectra from the HITRAN and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory data bases demonstrate the accuracy of our calculations. Synthetic spectra of water–nitric acid mixtures suggest that nitric acid has features at 7.5 and 11.25 μm that are capable of providing a clear signature for HNO3; the feature at 11.25 μm is particularly promising. Partition functions plus full line lists of transitions are made available in an electronic form as supplementary data to the article and at www.exomol.com.},

Title = {{Atmospheric effects of stellar cosmic rays on Earth-like exoplanets
   orbiting M-dwarfs}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{585}},
Abstract = {{M-dwarf stars are generally considered favourable for rocky planet
   detection. However, such planets may be subject to extreme conditions
   due to possible high stellar activity. The goal of this work is to
   determine the potential effect of stellar cosmic rays on key atmospheric
   species of Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone of M-dwarf
   stars and show corresponding changes in the planetary spectra. We build
   upon the cosmic rays model scheme of previous works, who considered
   cosmic ray induced NOx production, by adding further cosmic ray induced
   production mechanisms (e.g. for HOx) and introducing primary protons of
   a wider energy range (16 MeV-0.5 TeV). Previous studies suggested that
   planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaring
   conditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their
   ozone biosignature is completely destroyed. Our current study shows,
   however, that adding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a
   decrease in atmospheric methane abundance of up to 80\%. Furthermore,
   the cosmic ray induced HOx molecules react with NOx to produce HNO3,
   which produces strong HNO3 signals in the theoretical spectra and
   reduces NOx-induced catalytic destruction of ozone so that more than
   25\% of the ozone column remains. Hence, an ozone signal remains visible
   in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with a weaker intensity) when
   incorporating the new cosmic ray induced NOx and HOx schemes, even for a
   constantly flaring M-star case. We also find that HNO3 levels may be
   high enough to be potentially detectable. Since ozone concentrations,
   which act as the key shield against harmful UV radiation, are affected
   by cosmic rays via NOx-induced catalytic destruction of ozone, the
   impact of stellar cosmic rays on surface UV fluxes is also studied.}},
