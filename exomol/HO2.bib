Abstract = {The Earth's mesopause region between about 75 and 105 km is
   characterised by chemiluminescent emission from various lines of
   different molecules and atoms. This emission was and is important for
   the study of the chemistry and dynamics in this altitude region at
   nighttime. However, our understanding is still very limited with respect
   to molecular emissions with low intensities and high line densities that
   are challenging to resolve. Based on 10 years of data from the
   astronomical X-shooter echelle spectrograph at Cerro Paranal in Chile,
   we have characterised in detail this nightglow (pseudo-)continuum in the
   wavelength range from 300 to 1800 nm . We studied the spectral features,
   derived continuum components with similar variability, calculated
   climatologies, studied the response to solar activity, and even
   estimated the effective emission heights. The results indicate that the
   nightglow continuum at Cerro Paranal essentially consists of only two
   components, which exhibit very different properties. The main structures
   of these components peak at 595 and 1510 nm . While the former was
   previously identified as the main peak of the FeO ``orange arc{''}
   bands, the latter is a new discovery. Laboratory data and theory
   indicate that this feature and other structures between about 800 and at
   least 1800 nm are caused by emission from the low-lying A ` ` and A `
   states of HO2. In order to test this assumption, we performed runs with
   the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) with modified
   chemistry and found that the total intensity, layer profile, and
   variability indeed support this interpretation, where the excited HO2
   radicals are mostly produced from the termolecular recombination of H
   and O-2. The WACCM results for the continuum component that dominates at
   visual wavelengths show good agreement for FeO from the reaction of Fe
   and O-3. However, the simulated total emission appears to be too low,
   which would require additional mechanisms where the variability is
   dominated by O-3. A possible (but nevertheless insufficient) process
   could be the production of excited OFeOH by the reaction of FeOH and
   O-3.},

  abstract = {The (A) over tilde A' --> (X) over tilde(2)A `` electronic band system
	of HO2 has been simulated in emission using an extended version of
	the program RENNER (P. Jensen, M. Brumm, W. P. Kraemer, and P. R.
	Bunker, J, Mol. Spectrosc. 171, 31-57 (1995)). The two electronic
	states involved in this transition have strongly bent equilibrium
	geometries but they correlate together to form a (2)Pi state at linearity.
	As a result the energy level pattern in the states is affected by
	electronic angular momentum effects (i.e., the Renner effect and
	spin-orbit coupling). To simulate the spectrum, we have calculated
	ab initio the potential energy surfaces, electric dipole moment surfaces,
	magnetic dipole moment surfaces, spin-orbit coupling parameter, and
	the electronic angular momentum matrix elements. Some of the forbidden
	Delta K-a = 0 transitions occurring in the spectrum are induced by
	the magnetic dipole transition moment, and the others are electric
	dipole transitions that gain intensity because of the Renner interaction,
	spin-orbit coupling, or because of rotation-vibration interaction.
	All of these effects are allowed for in our calculation. The electric
	dipole transition moment is very small (0.017 D at the ground state
	equilibrium geometry) and because of this the magnetic dipole transitions
	are quite visible; the strongest magnetic dipole transitions are
	calculated to be about 10 times weaker than the strongest electric
	dipole transitions. In this way previous experimental assignments
	(E. H. Fink and D. A. Ramsay, J. Mel. Spectrosc. 185, 304-324 (1997))
	are confirmed theoretically. },
