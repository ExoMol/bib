Abstract = {Absolute line strength measurements of hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical in the
   OO-stretching (nu(3)) fundamental band have been performed by means of
   mid-infrared time-resolved dual-comb spectroscopy. By employing two sets
   of dual-comb spectrometers, high-resolution time-resolved spectra of HO2
   and HCl, formed in the photolysis reaction system of Cl-2/CH3OH/O-2,
   could be, respectively, measured near 1123 and 3059 cm(-1). With kinetic
   simulations, spectral analysis of both HO2 and HCl, as well as the
   accurate line strength of the HCl R(9) transition at 3059.316 cm(-1), an
   absolute line strength of the nu(3) 13(1,13) <- 12(1,12) F-1,F-2
   transitions in HO2 at 1122.983 cm(-1) was first determined to be 1.80 x
   10(-20) cm molecule(-1) with a small uncertainty down to 4\% under the
   conditions with low initial concentrations of Cl radical (1.63-1.81 x
   10(13) molecule cm(-3)). Furthermore, broadband high-resolution spectra
   of the nu(3) fundamental band of HO2 were recorded in the range of
   1088-1124 cm(-1) with an average spectral resolution of 0.002 cm(-1). By
   contour fitting the measured broadband spectra with PGOPHER, the line
   strengths of hundreds of rovibrational transitions were obtained
   relative to the well-determined HO2 lines at 1122.983 cm(-1), and those
   values were observed to be higher than those tabulated in the HITRAN
   database by a factor of similar to 2.8. Moreover, the absolute band
   strength of the nu(3) fundamental band in HO2 was derived to be 22.3 km
   mol(-1) with an uncertainty of 5\%. This work providing precise and
   detailed spectral data would be crucial in revisiting the theoretical
   modeling of HO2 geometry and updating the database of the HO2 radical.},

Title = {Structure, variability, and origin of the low-latitude nightglow
   continuum between 300 and 1800 nm: evidence for HO<sub>2</sub> emission

Abstract = {The Earth's mesopause region between about 75 and 105 km is
   characterised by chemiluminescent emission from various lines of
   different molecules and atoms. This emission was and is important for
   the study of the chemistry and dynamics in this altitude region at
   nighttime. However, our understanding is still very limited with respect
   to molecular emissions with low intensities and high line densities that
   are challenging to resolve. Based on 10 years of data from the
   astronomical X-shooter echelle spectrograph at Cerro Paranal in Chile,
   we have characterised in detail this nightglow (pseudo-)continuum in the
   wavelength range from 300 to 1800 nm . We studied the spectral features,
   derived continuum components with similar variability, calculated
   climatologies, studied the response to solar activity, and even
   estimated the effective emission heights. The results indicate that the
   nightglow continuum at Cerro Paranal essentially consists of only two
   components, which exhibit very different properties. The main structures
   of these components peak at 595 and 1510 nm . While the former was
   previously identified as the main peak of the FeO ``orange arc{''}
   bands, the latter is a new discovery. Laboratory data and theory
   indicate that this feature and other structures between about 800 and at
   least 1800 nm are caused by emission from the low-lying A ` ` and A `
   states of HO2. In order to test this assumption, we performed runs with
   the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) with modified
   chemistry and found that the total intensity, layer profile, and
   variability indeed support this interpretation, where the excited HO2
   radicals are mostly produced from the termolecular recombination of H
   and O-2. The WACCM results for the continuum component that dominates at
   visual wavelengths show good agreement for FeO from the reaction of Fe
   and O-3. However, the simulated total emission appears to be too low,
   which would require additional mechanisms where the variability is
   dominated by O-3. A possible (but nevertheless insufficient) process
   could be the production of excited OFeOH by the reaction of FeOH and
   O-3.},

	the program RENNER (P. Jensen, M. Brumm, W. P. Kraemer, and P. R.
	Bunker, J, Mol. Spectrosc. 171, 31-57 (1995)). The two electronic
	states involved in this transition have strongly bent equilibrium
	geometries but they correlate together to form a (2)Pi state at linearity.
	As a result the energy level pattern in the states is affected by
	electronic angular momentum effects (i.e., the Renner effect and
	spin-orbit coupling). To simulate the spectrum, we have calculated
	ab initio the potential energy surfaces, electric dipole moment surfaces,
	magnetic dipole moment surfaces, spin-orbit coupling parameter, and
	the electronic angular momentum matrix elements. Some of the forbidden
	Delta K-a = 0 transitions occurring in the spectrum are induced by
	the magnetic dipole transition moment, and the others are electric
	dipole transitions that gain intensity because of the Renner interaction,
	spin-orbit coupling, or because of rotation-vibration interaction.
	All of these effects are allowed for in our calculation. The electric
	dipole transition moment is very small (0.017 D at the ground state
	equilibrium geometry) and because of this the magnetic dipole transitions
	are quite visible; the strongest magnetic dipole transitions are
	calculated to be about 10 times weaker than the strongest electric
	dipole transitions. In this way previous experimental assignments
	(E. H. Fink and D. A. Ramsay, J. Mel. Spectrosc. 185, 304-324 (1997))
	are confirmed theoretically. },
