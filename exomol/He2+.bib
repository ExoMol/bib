    abstract = {Depopulation of metastable He(23S) and He(21S) by radiative association with helium ions resulting in the formation of the He\\$\_\\{2\\}^\\{+\\}\\$ molecular ions is investigated. Rate coefficients for spontaneous radiative association of the He\\$\_\\{2\\}^\\{+\\}\\$ molecular ion on the spin-doublet manifold are presented as functions of temperature from 10 up to 500 000 K considering the association to rotational-vibrational bound states of the lowest doublet electronic states \\$X^\\{2\\}\\Sigma ^\\{+\\}\_\\{u\\}\\$ and \\$A^\\{2\\}\\Sigma ^\\{+\\}\_\\{g\\}\\$ from the continuum states of the excited doublet electronic states \\$B^\\{2\\}\\Sigma ^\\{+\\}\_\\{u\\}\\$ and \\$D^\\{2\\}\\Sigma ^\\{+\\}\_\\{u\\}\\$. The dipole-driven processes B → A and D → A are compared to the quadrupole-driven processes B → X and D → X. For all considered temperatures, the dipole-driven process D → A dominates over the other processes. The rate coefficient for the quadrupole-driven process B → X is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the rate coefficient of the dipole-driven process B → A.},
