Abstract = {HeH+ was the first heteronuclear molecule to form in the metal-free
   Universe after the Big Bang. The molecule gained significant attention
   following its first circumstellar detection in the young and dense
   planetary nebula NGC 7027. We target some hydride ions associated with
   the noble gases (HeH+, ArH+, and NeH+) to investigate their formation in
   harsh environments like the nova outburst region. We use a
   photoionization modeling (based on previously published best-fit
   physical parameters) of the moderately fast ONe type nova, QU Vulpeculae
   1984, and the CO type novae, RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. Our
   steady-state modeling reveals a convincing amount of HeH+, especially in
   the dense clump of RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii. The calculated upper
   limit on the surface brightness of HeH+ transitions suggests that the
   James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could detect some of them,
   particularly in sources like RS Ophiuchi and V1716 Scorpii, which have
   similar physical and chemical conditions and evolution. It must be
   clearly noted that the sources studied are used as templates, and not as
   targets for observations. The detection of these lines could be useful
   for determining the physical conditions in similar types of systems and
   for validating our predictions based on new electron-impact
   ro-vibrational collisional data at temperatures of up to 20 000 K.},

Title = {{Benchmark Rovibrational Linelists and Einstein A-coefficients for the
   Primordial Molecules and Isotopologues}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{878}},
Abstract = {{Complete benchmark rovibrational energy linelists calculated for the
   primordial polar molecules of the universe, namely HD+, HD, and the HeH+
   isotopologues, with accuracy up to 10(-2) cm(-1) for low-lying states,
   are presented. To allow for these calculations to be performed, new
   high-accuracy potential energy curves, which include the diagonal
   Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic corrections and the leading relativistic
   corrections, are determined. Also, a new approach for calculating
   non-adiabatic corrections involving an effective vibrational nuclear
   mass obtained based on the atoms-in-molecules theory is employed. The
   vibrational and rotational masses are taken as being different and
   dependent on the nuclear distance. Accurate dipole moment curves are
   calculated and used to generate lists of Einstein A-coefficients. The
   energy linelists and the sets of Einstein A-coefficients for HD are
   upgrades of previous calculations including quasibound states, while for
   HD+ and HeH+ and its isotopologues the present results represent
   significant improvement over the previous calculations. The results
   obtained here suggest that, with the inclusion of the non-adiabatic
   corrections, the accuracy limit at least for low-lying states might have
   been reached. Thus, further progress should involve accounting for even
   smaller effects such as the quantum-electrodynamics corrections. The
   present results represent the state-of-the-art of theoretical
   spectroscopy of the primordial polar molecules.}},
