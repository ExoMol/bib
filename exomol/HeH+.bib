Abstract = {{Complete benchmark rovibrational energy linelists calculated for the
   primordial polar molecules of the universe, namely HD+, HD, and the HeH+
   isotopologues, with accuracy up to 10(-2) cm(-1) for low-lying states,
   are presented. To allow for these calculations to be performed, new
   high-accuracy potential energy curves, which include the diagonal
   Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic corrections and the leading relativistic
   corrections, are determined. Also, a new approach for calculating
   non-adiabatic corrections involving an effective vibrational nuclear
   mass obtained based on the atoms-in-molecules theory is employed. The
   vibrational and rotational masses are taken as being different and
   dependent on the nuclear distance. Accurate dipole moment curves are
   calculated and used to generate lists of Einstein A-coefficients. The
   energy linelists and the sets of Einstein A-coefficients for HD are
   upgrades of previous calculations including quasibound states, while for
   HD+ and HeH+ and its isotopologues the present results represent
   significant improvement over the previous calculations. The results
   obtained here suggest that, with the inclusion of the non-adiabatic
   corrections, the accuracy limit at least for low-lying states might have
   been reached. Thus, further progress should involve accounting for even
   smaller effects such as the quantum-electrodynamics corrections. The
   present results represent the state-of-the-art of theoretical
   spectroscopy of the primordial polar molecules.}},
