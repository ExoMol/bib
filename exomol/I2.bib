Abstract = {In this paper, we complete a full-thrust audit of an iodine-based
   gridded ion thruster. Prior results have demonstrated excellent
   agreement between indirect and direct laboratory thrust estimates. Here,
   thrust estimates from numerical modeling, indirect laboratory testing
   from diagnostic probes and propulsion system telemetry, indirect
   in-space testing from onboard propulsion system telemetry, and direct
   in-space testing by analyzing orbital maneuvers are compared to
   demonstrate consistency between the four methods and complete the thrust
   audit. Results from recent in-space testing of the iodine-based thruster
   demonstrate that thrust estimates from all four methods agree to within
   three standard deviations of uncertainty for the 11 maneuvers studied.
   This thrust audit represents a critical step toward improving the
   understanding and technological maturity of iodine-based gridded ion
   thrusters for future mission applications, and it demonstrates the
   utility of recently developed in-space thrust inference techniques for
   analyzing low-thrust maneuvers.},

abstract = {This article reports on laser absorption spectroscopy of iodine gas between 915 nm and 985 nm. This wavelength range is scanned utilizing a narrow linewidth and mode-hop-free tunable diode-laser whose frequency is actively controlled using a calibrated wavelength meter. This allows us to provide an iodine atlas that contains almost 10,000 experimentally observed reference lines with an uncertainty of 50 MHz. For common lines, good agreement is found with a publication by Gerstenkorn and Luc (1978). The new rich dataset allows existing models of the iodine molecule to be refined and can serve as a reference for laser frequency calibration and stabilization.}
