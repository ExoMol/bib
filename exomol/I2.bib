Abstract = {With as many as 2000 satellites per year forecast to be launched over
   the next decade, onboard propulsion systems will become increasingly
   important for ensuring both mission success and a sustainable space
   environment. Plasma-based electric propulsion systems are particularly
   attractive because of their high fuel efficiency, but due to challenges
   with conventional propellants such as xenon, a strong interest in viable
   alternatives has emerged. One such alternative is iodine, which in
   addition to space-based applications, is also of use in a number of
   ground-based industrial applications such as plasma etching. With a
   lower cost, higher global production output, and a reduced ionization
   threshold compared with xenon, iodine has the potential to meet current
   and future space industry demand while also providing improved
   propulsion performance. Furthermore, iodine is a solid at typical
   ambient conditions with a high storage density. However, iodine is
   chemically reactive with many common materials and has a more complex
   plasma chemistry that includes molecular dissociation, attachment to
   form negative ions, and several ionization processes creating positive
   atomic and molecular ions. This topical review provides a comprehensive
   overview of iodine within the context of plasma applications and also
   serves as a useful data source for various thermodynamic properties,
   collision cross-sections, and iodine-surface interactions. In addition
   to discussing the physical and atomic/molecular properties of iodine, we
   also highlight important theoretical, numerical, and experimental work
   in the field and discuss the current state-of-the-art: including the
   space flight heritage of iodine-fueled propulsion systems and remaining
   research/technical challenges.},

    abstract = {A time-independent, one-dimensional plasma model is proposed and used to investigate the characteristics and performance of iodine-fueled Hall thrusters. The model accounts for radial plasma-wall losses and includes major iodine collisional reaction processes such as molecular dissociation. Thruster performance is found to be comparable to that obtained with xenon, although iodine allows extension of the operating range to lower mass flow rates and discharge voltages. The model predicts an appreciable fraction of molecular ions (I    2 +) within the thruster plume that depends on the discharge voltage and propellant mass flow rate and that contributes significantly to the thrust. In contrast to xenon, electron impact dissociation of iodine leads to the unique formation of two distinct ionization zones within the thruster: a region closer to the anode associated with the ionization of molecular iodine and a downstream region associated with the ionization of atomic iodine.},

   Hall thruster}},
Journal = {Vacuum},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {222},
Abstract = {The development of space technology brings about an increasing demand
   for electric thrusters. Iodine has been considered a feasible
   alternative to resource-critical xenon. Numerical and experimental
   methods are used to study the performance of the iodine-fed Hall
   thruster. The ionization and acceleration characteristics are
   investigated in the simulation with a particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo
   collision model. Different from previous simulations of noble gas, the
   dissociation equation of molecular iodine is added to the code for
   propulsive performance evaluation. A dissociation region in the
   discharge chamber is presented and described in detail. The propulsive
   performances of the iodine-fed Hall thruster are calculated by the
   plasma parameters. Meanwhile, the experimental measurements are finished
   for model verification and performance comparison at nominal conditions.
   The measured data is slightly lower than the simulated data. The error
   between them is about 1.65\%. The reasons are analyzed and discussed.
   Then, the performance is predicted and measured using this simulated and
   experimental method within 20\% mass flow rate and 10\% anode voltage
   fluctuations relative to the nominal condition. Further optimizations of
   the simulation and experiment are in progress.},

abstract = {High-level ab initio calculations are carried out to investigate the fine structure of electronic states correlating with the three lowest dissociation limits of the silicon iodide (SiI) molecule. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 23 Ʌ-S states and 45 Ω states are calculated by using multireference configuration interaction method with the Davidson correction (MRCI+Q). The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects are also accounted. Based on the calculated PECs, the spectroscopic constants of the bound states are evaluated, which are in a good agreement with previous experimental results. The predissociation mechanisms of the 22Δ state are studied, the perturbation on vibrational levels and predissociation channels are illuminated. Our investigation indicates that the higher vibrational levels (ν'≥ 7) of the doublet 12Σ+ are perturbed by the crossing quartet sate 14Σ−, which satisfactorily explains the perturbations of the (7,0) and (8,0) rovibronic band systems of the A-X transition detected in previous experiments. In addition, the transition dipole moments (TDMs), Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) and radiative lifetimes for spontaneous emission from the excited states to the ground state are evaluated.}

Title = {Iodine Electric Propulsion System Thrust Validation: From Numerical
   Modeling to In-Space Testing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER},
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {In this paper, we complete a full-thrust audit of an iodine-based
   gridded ion thruster. Prior results have demonstrated excellent
   agreement between indirect and direct laboratory thrust estimates. Here,
   thrust estimates from numerical modeling, indirect laboratory testing
   from diagnostic probes and propulsion system telemetry, indirect
   in-space testing from onboard propulsion system telemetry, and direct
   in-space testing by analyzing orbital maneuvers are compared to
   demonstrate consistency between the four methods and complete the thrust
   audit. Results from recent in-space testing of the iodine-based thruster
   demonstrate that thrust estimates from all four methods agree to within
   three standard deviations of uncertainty for the 11 maneuvers studied.
   This thrust audit represents a critical step toward improving the
   understanding and technological maturity of iodine-based gridded ion
   thrusters for future mission applications, and it demonstrates the
   utility of recently developed in-space thrust inference techniques for
   analyzing low-thrust maneuvers.},

This wavelength range is scanned utilizing a narrow linewidth and mode-hop-free tunable diode-laser whose frequency is actively controlled using a calibrated wavelength meter. This allows us to provide an iodine atlas that contains almost 10,000 experimentally observed reference lines with an uncertainty of 50 MHz. For common lines, good agreement is found with a publication by Gerstenkorn and Luc (1978). The new rich dataset allows existing models of the iodine molecule to be refined and can serve as a reference for laser frequency calibration and stabilization.}

Title = {{Widely usable interpolation formulae for hyperfine splittings in the
   $^{127}$I$_2$ spectrum}},
Journal =EPJD,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {31-44},
Abstract = {Based oil new systematic high precision measurements of hyperfine
   splittings in different rovibrational bands of I-127(2) in the near
   infrared spectral range between 778 nm and 816 nm, and the data in the
   range from 660 nm to 514 urn available from literature, the quantum
   number dependence of the different hyperfine interaction parameters was
   reinvestigated. As detailed as possible parameters were re-fitted from
   the reported hyperfine splittings in literature, considering that the
   interaction parameters should vary smoothly with the vibrational and
   rotational quantum numbers, and follow appropriate physical models. This
   type of consistency has not been sufficiently taken into account by
   other authors. To our knowledge it is now possible for the first time to
   separate the his contributions of the two electronic states B(3)Pi(0u+)
   and X(1)Sigma(g)(+) for optical transitions in a very large wavelength
   range. New interpolation formulae could be derived for both states,
   describing the quantum number dependences of the nuclear electric
   quadrupole, of the nuclear spin-rotation and also of the nuclear
   spin-spin interactions. Using these new interpolation formulae the
   hyperfine splittings for the components with the quantum number
   condition F - J = 0 can be calculated with an uncertainty of less than
   or equal to30 kHz for transitions in the wavelength range between 514 nm
   and 820 nm.},
