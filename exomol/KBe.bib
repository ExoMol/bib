  abstract={An ab initio calculations on the ground and low-lying excited states (X 2 Σ + , 2 2 Σ + , 3 2 Σ + , 1 4 Π, 2 4 Π, 1 4 Σ + , 2 4 Σ + , and 3 4 Σ + ) of KBe molecule have been performed using multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) plus Davidson corrections (MRCI+Q) approach with all electron basis set aug-cc-pCV5Z-DK for Be and def2-AQZVPP-JKFI for K. The 3 2 Σ + , 1 4 Π, 2 4 Π, 1 4 Σ + , 2 4 Σ + , and 3 4 Σ + states are investigated for the first time. Inner shell electron correlations are computed on the potential energy curves (PECs) calculations. The spectroscopic and molecular parameters are also predicted. In addition, The transition properties including transition dipole moment, Franck–Condon factors q υ′υ″ , Einstein coefficients A υ′υ″ , and the radiative lifetimes τ υ′ for the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1674-1056/26/3/033101/cpb_26_3_033101_ieqn1.gif] {${2}^{2}{\Sigma }^{+}-{\text{X}}^{2}{\Sigma }^{+}$} , ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1674-1056/26/3/033101/cpb_26_3_033101_ieqn2.gif] {${3}^{2}{\Sigma }^{+}-{\text{X}}^{2}{\Sigma }^{+}$} , and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1674-1056/26/3/033101/cpb_26_3_033101_ieqn3.gif] {${2}^{4}\Pi -{1}^{4}\Pi $} transitions are predicted at the same time.}
