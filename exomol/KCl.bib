Abstract = {{Biomass, especially herbaceous fuel, contains high amounts of volatile
   alkali metals and chlorine, which may cause problems, such as
   deposition, corrosion, and agglomeration during combustion. The aim of
   this work was to obtain more information on the influence of temperature
   on the transformation of alkali metal species. The combustion
   experiments with rice straw, coal, and additive FeS2 were performed at
   various temperatures between 600 and 1,100 degrees C in a laboratory
   scale reactor. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were used to
   predict the behavior of alkali metal species and interpret the
   experimental results. The results indicate that the amounts of potassium
   and sodium in flue gas were quite little compared to those retained in
   the bottom ash. KCl(g) and NaCl(g), which were the major alkali metal
   species of flue gas, were independent on a temperature below 800 degrees
   C. KOH(g) also played an important role in the 1,000-1,100 degrees C
   interval. In the bottom ash, the fraction of potassium in sulfates
   decreased from 61.8\% at 600 degrees C to 0.5\% at 1,100 degrees C.
   Compared to potassium, most of vaporizable sodium was captured by
   (alumino-) silicates and retained in the bottom ash.}},

	the tilt angle. We examine the quantum mechanics of rotors in tilted

	of avoided crossings quantified by the study of nearest-neighbor
	spacing distributions as a function of energy and tilting angle.
	Finally, we examine the influence of classical periodic orbits on
	rotor wave functions. Many wave functions in the tilted field case
	are found to be highly nonseparable in spherical polar coordinates.
	Localization of wave functions in the vicinity of classical periodic
	orbits, both stable and unstable, is observed for many states. (c)

  abstract = {The Auger electron spectra (AES) following the chlorine 2p ionization
	in the gas phase alkali-chlorides as well as in the HCl and DCl molecules
	were studied theoretically and experimentally. Nonrelativistic ab
	initio calculations based on quantum chemical methods and the one-center
	approximation were used to compute the Cl L2,3VV AES. The vibrational
	band structure in the AES was simulated by full life time vibrational
	interference (LVI) theory and a more approximate moment method. Calculations
	were compared with the corresponding experimental electron or photon
	impact excited spectra. Overall features and changes in the series
	of the experimental AES are correctly predicted by the theory. For
	the most intense transitions in these spectra a qualitative explanation
	of the energies is given on the basis of a model that includes electrostatic
	interactions, Pauli repulsion, and polarization. This explains that
	the substantial changes of the spectra with X are due to a R-3 dependence
	of the electrostatic interaction on the X-Cl bond length. A comparison
	of the two theoretical methods shows that the LVI vibrational band
	breadths are well reproduced by the moment method in the AES of HCl,
	DCl, and LiCl, whereas the moment breadths are underestimated in
	the AES of NaCl and KCl. The LVI band breadths for HCl, DCl, and
	KCl are in good agreement with experimental data. In contrast, the
	experimental spectra for LiCl and NaCl show almost two times broader
	vibrational bands than predicted by the LVI theory. This contradiction
	indicates that the LiCl and NaCl vapors are contaminated by the dimer
	form of these substances. A large contribution of Li2Cl2 (74\%) and
	Na2Cl2 (29\%) was measured in the LiCl and NaCl vapors by time-of-flight
	mass spectroscopy. The Auger peaks in the spectra of the dimers lie
	very close to the monomer peaks, and thus make it very difficult
	to distinguish dimer and monomer contributions. (C) 2000 American

  abstract = {In a classical model, some anions exist due to the attraction between
	an electron and a molecule's dipole moment. When the dipole moment
	is sufficiently large (mu(crit)>2.5 D), an electron can be trapped.
	Can a sufficiently large quadrupole moment produce the same effect?
	To help answer this question, we can search for molecules with a
	large quadrupole moment and use predictive, ab initio, correlated
	quantum chemistry methods to assess whether an anion forms and, if
	it does, to discover its nature. For this purpose, coupled-cluster
	calculations are reported for the structure and properties of KnClm
	and KnClm- (n,m=0-2). The KCl2 superhalogen was found to have an
	electron affinity of 4.2 eV and is stable towards dissociation by
	26 kcal/mol. The (KCl)(2) dimer has a rhombic ground state with a
	large electric quadrupole moment. Rhombic and linear configurations
	of the (KCl) 2 2 anion correspond to stationary states that are nearly
	degenerate in total energy. The rhombic anion has a single, weakly
	bound state that could be a ``quadrupole-bound{''} state on the basis
	of a comparison of its characteristics with those of dipole-bound
	states. Linear KClKCl- has seven excited states; four of them can
	be identified as dipole-bound states. KCl and KCl2 possess rather
	similar dipole moments and their anions have two excited dipole-bound
	states each. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[}S0021-9606(99)31324-6].},

	procedure using the Z vector method. Generally the calculated spectroscopic
	properties are in very good agreement with experimental data. Relativistic

	to this model the derivatives of the EFG, partial derivative(n)q(R)/partial

	show alternating sign behaviour with increasing power n. Hence, the

	the electrical anharmonicity (curvature of cl(R)) are of different
	sign, and we expect partial cancellation of anharmonicity effects
	in the vibrational dependence of the NQCCs. Nevertheless, a perturbative
	vibrational-rotational analysis reveals a strong dependence of the
	chlorine and Group 1 element NQCCs on the vibrational level due to
	dominating mechanical anharmonicity.},
