abstract = {We have performed a systematic ab initio study on alkali and alkaline
earth hydroxide neutral (MOH) and anionic (MOH-) species where M = Li, Na, K, Rb,
Cs or Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba. The CCSD(T) method with extended basis sets and Dirac-Fock
relativistic effective core potentials for the heavier atoms has been used to study
their equilibrium geometries, interaction energies, electron affinities, electric
dipole moment, and potential energy surfaces. All neutral and anionic species exhibit
a linear shape with the exception of BeOH, BeOH-, and MgOH-, for which the equilibrium
structure is found to be bent. Our analysis shows that the alkaline earth hydroxide
anions are valence-bound whereas the alkali hydroxide anions are dipole bound. In the
context of sympathetic cooling of OH- by collision with ultracold alkali and alkaline
earth atoms, we investigate the 2D MOH- potential energy surfaces and the associative
detachment reaction M + OH →- MOH + e-, which is the only energetically allowed reactive
channel in the cold regime. We discuss the implication for the sympathetic cooling
of OH- and conclude that Li and K are the best candidates for an ultracold buffer gas.},

Abstract = {Geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and bond

   (hydrides, chlorides, fluorides. hydroxides and oxides) of Li, Na, and K
   from coupled cluster theory {[}CCSD(T)] calculations including core -
   valence correlation with the aug-cc-pwCVnZ basis set (n = D, T, Q, and
   5). To accurately calculate the heats of formation, the following
   additional correction were included: scalar relativistic effects, atomic
   spin-orbit effects, and vibrational zero-point energies. For calibration
   purposes, the properties of some of the lithium compounds were predicted
   with iterative triple and quadruple excitations via CCSDT and CCSDTQ.
   The calculated geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and
   bond dissociation energies were compared with all available experimental
   measurements and are in excellent agreement with high-quality
   experimental data. High-level calculations are required to correctly
   predict that K2O is linear and that the ground state of KO is
   (2)Sigma(+), not (2)Pi, as in LiO and NaO. This reliable and consistent

Abstract = {High-level ab initio calculations, including variants of the Wn and G3
   procedures, have been used to determine the structures and heats of
   formation of the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides and
   hydroxides (M2O, MOH: M = Li, Na, and K; MO, M(OH)(2): M = Be, Mg, and
   Ca). Our best structures were obtained at the
   CCSD(T)(riv,rv)/aug'-cc-pWCVQZ level and are in uniformly close
   agreement with available experimental data, with a mean absolute
   deviation from experimental metal-oxygen bond lengths of just 0.007
   Angstrom. Structures obtained with CCSD(T)/cc-pWCVQZ, B3-LYP/cc-pVTZ,
   B3-LYP/6-31 G(2df,p), and MP2(full)/6-311+G(3df,2p) are also in good
   agreement with experiment. Zero-point vibrational energies and enthalpy
   temperature corrections are found to be relatively insensitive to the
   various procedures employed. However, the heats of formation for these
   molecules are challenging targets for high-level ab initio procedures.
   In the Wn-type procedures, it is found that expanding the correlation
   space on the metal atoms from the normal relaxed valence (rv) (or
   frozen-core) specification to relaxed inner valence (riv) requires the
   use of newly developed core-valence basis sets (cc-pWCVnZ) in the
   extrapolation calculations to obtain reliable results. Our best
   calculated heats of formation (DeltaH(f) (298)) come from a procedure
   designated W2C//ACQ, while oG3{[}CC](dir,full) is the best of the
   G3-type procedures. Recommended DeltaH(f) (298) values, weighted toward
   the W2C//ACQ results, are -157 +/- 5 (Li2O), -25 +/- 5 (Na2O), -60 +/- 5
   (K2O), +130 +/- 12 (BeO), +142 +/- 10 (MgO), +26 +/- 17 (CaO), -239 +/-

energy bond lengths are RKO=4.2913 au and ROH=1.7688 au, with an estimated accuracy
of 2%. The corresponding dipole moment is 3.3 au (8.46 D) with a similar accuracy
estimate. This is to our knowledge the first value ever reported for the KOH dipole
moment, and the large value suggests that KOH will be an effective electron scatterer
in MHD plasmas.},

value of the eqQ of KOH is close to that of KF. The separation between Σ and Δ

for a number of excited vibrational states of KOH and KOD. From an analysis of
the J-dependence of the l-type resonance interactions the separation of the l
sublevels of several ν1 ν2l 0 states has been obtained. The cubic anharmonic
contributions to α1 and α2 were determined and the sign and isotopic variation
of α2 are shown to be consistent with a nearly harmonic bending potential function.
An re structure has been determined from the data using a calculated value for α3 .
On the basis of the present data, a severely anharmonic bending potential function
for KOH can be excluded. Our results are compared with those for the heavier alkali
hydroxides.},
