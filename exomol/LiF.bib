Abstract = {{Vibration-rotation line lists for (LiF)-Li-6, (LiF)-Li-7,
   (LiCl)-Li-6-Cl-35, (LiCl)-Li-6-Cl-37, (LiCl)-Li-7-Cl-35, and
   (LiCl)-Li-7-Cl-37 in the X-1 Sigma(+) ground states have been prepared.
   The rovibrational energy levels have been calculated using potential
   energy surfaces determined by direct potential-fitting employing the
   rotational and rovibrational transition frequencies of all
   isotopologues, and required the inclusion of Born-Oppenheimer breakdown
   terms. Dipole moment functions calculated ab initio at the
   MRCI/aug-cc-pwCV5Z level have been used for line strength calculations.
   Partition functions for temperatures up to 5000 K have been calculated.
   LiF and LiCl are predicted to be present in the atmospheres of hot rocky
   exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and cool stars.}},
