abstract = {We investigate the LiF spectrum up to 7800 cm−1 above the first dissociation limit. The ab initio calculations of the adiabatic potentials and other molecular functions are performed in a wide range of interatomic separations, r=1-17 bohr. We consider the model of two interacting electronic states including both the bound states and the resonances of two kinds, the tunneling resonances and the predissociative ones. The Born–Oppenheimer potentials are modeled with use of two auxiliary functions containing 15 variable parameters each, whose values are defined by least-squares fitting for the best reproduction of the adiabatic potentials calculated ab initio, as well as the experimental rovibrational transition frequencies. Then we determine the diabatic potentials and the diabatic coupling via the adiabatic potentials and the angle of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis rotation obtained by integration of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element. The energies of the bound states, as well as the positions and widths of the resonances are calculated. The observed transition frequencies are reproduced with the standard deviation of 0.0009 cm−1 for 7LiF, 0.0006 cm−1 for 6LiF, and within the experimental uncertainties for the most of the lines. The line lists for the bound-bound X-X rovibrational transitions are calculated for quantum numbers v≤50,Δv≤15,J≤170 (J≤200 for the 0-0 and 1-0 bands).}

Abstract = {{Vibration-rotation line lists for (LiF)-Li-6, (LiF)-Li-7,
   (LiCl)-Li-6-Cl-35, (LiCl)-Li-6-Cl-37, (LiCl)-Li-7-Cl-35, and
   (LiCl)-Li-7-Cl-37 in the X-1 Sigma(+) ground states have been prepared.
   The rovibrational energy levels have been calculated using potential
   energy surfaces determined by direct potential-fitting employing the
   rotational and rovibrational transition frequencies of all
   isotopologues, and required the inclusion of Born-Oppenheimer breakdown
   terms. Dipole moment functions calculated ab initio at the
   MRCI/aug-cc-pwCV5Z level have been used for line strength calculations.
   Partition functions for temperatures up to 5000 K have been calculated.
   LiF and LiCl are predicted to be present in the atmospheres of hot rocky
   exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and cool stars.}},
