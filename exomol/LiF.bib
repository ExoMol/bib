  abstract={Vibration–rotation line lists for 6 LiF, 7 LiF, 6 Li 35 Cl, 6 Li 37 Cl, 7 Li 35 Cl, and 7 Li 37 Cl in the X 1 Sigma + ground states have been prepared. The rovibrational energy levels have been calculated using potential energy surfaces determined by direct potential-fitting employing the rotational and rovibrational transition frequencies of all isotopologues, and required the inclusion of Born–Oppenheimer breakdown terms. Dipole moment functions calculated ab initio at the MRCI/aug-cc-pwCV5Z level have been used for line strength calculations. Partition functions for temperatures up to 5000 K have been calculated. LiF and LiCl are predicted to be present in the atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and cool stars.}
