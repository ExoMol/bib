Abstract = {{Linelists and radiative cooling functions in the local thermodynamic
   equilibrium limit have been computed for the six most important
   isotopologues of lithium hydride, (LiH)-Li-7, (LiH)-Li-6, (LiD)-Li-7,
   (LiD)-Li-6, (LiT)-Li-7, and (LiT)-Li-6. The data are based on the most
   accurate dipole moment and potential energy curves presently available,
   the latter including adiabatic and leading relativistic corrections.
   Distance-dependent reduced vibrational masses are used to account for
   non-adiabatic corrections of the rovibrational energy levels. Even for
   (LiH)-Li-7, for which linelists have been reported previously, the
   present linelist is more accurate. Among all isotopologues, (LiH)-Li-7
   and (LiH)-Li-6 are the best coolants, as shown by the radiative cooling
   functions.}},

abstract = {Abstract A very accurate dipole moment curve (DMC) for the ground X  electronic state of the 7LiH molecule is reported. It is calculated with the use of all-particle explicitly correlated Gaussian functions with shifted centers. The \{DMC\} – the most accurate to our knowledge – and the corresponding highly accurate potential energy curve are used to calculate the transition energies, the transition dipole moments, and the Einstein coefficients for the rovibrational transitions with 
 J = - 1 and v 5 . The importance of the non-adiabatic effects in determining these properties is evaluated using the model of a vibrational R-dependent effective reduced mass in the rovibrational calculations introduced earlier (Diniz et al., 2015). The results of the present calculations are used to assess the quality of the two complete linelists of 7LiH available in the literature. }

The rovibrational energy levels have been calculated using potential energy surfaces determined by direct potential-fitting employing the rotational and rovibrational transition frequencies of all isotopologues, and required the inclusion of Born–Oppenheimer breakdown terms. Dipole moment functions calculated ab initio at the MRCI/aug-cc-pwCV5Z level have been used for line strength calculations. Partition functions for temperatures up to 5000 K have been calculated. LiF and LiCl are predicted to be present in the atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and cool stars.}
