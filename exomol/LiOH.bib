Title = {Following the Lithium: Tracing Li-bearing Molecules across Age, Mass,
   and Gravity in Brown Dwarfs},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {919},
Abstract = {Lithium is an important element for the understanding of ultracool
   dwarfs because it is lost to fusion at masses above similar to 68 M (J).
   Hence, the presence of atomic Li has served as an indicator of the
   nearby H-burning boundary at about 75 M (J) between brown dwarfs and
   very low mass stars. Historically, the ``lithium test,{''} a search for
   the presence of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object
   has a substellar mass. While the Li test could, in principle, be used to
   distinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no
   longer found as an atomic gas but rather a molecular species such as
   LiH, LiF, LiOH, and LiCl in cooler atmospheres. The L- and T-type dwarfs
   are quite faint at 670 nm and thus challenging targets for
   high-resolution spectroscopy. But only recently have experimental
   molecular line lists become available for the molecular Li species,
   allowing molecular Li mass discrimination. Here we generated the latest
   opacity of these Li-bearing molecules and performed a thermochemical
   equilibrium atmospheric composition calculation of their abundances.
   Finally, we computed thermal emission spectra for a series of
   radiative-convective equilibrium models of cloudy and cloudless brown
   dwarf atmospheres (with T (eff) = 500-2400 K and logg=4.0-5.0 <i ) to
   understand where the presence of atmospheric lithium-bearing species is
   most easily detected as a function of brown dwarf mass and age. After
   atomic Li, the best spectral signatures were found to be LiF at
   10.5-12.5 mu m and LiCl at 14.5-18.5 mu m. Also, LiH shows a narrow
   feature at similar to 9.38 mu m.},

   combined laboratory and ab initio study}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {11715-11730},
Abstract = {{Millimeter wave rotational spectroscopy and ab initio calculations are
   used to explore the potential energy surface of LiOH and LiOD with
   particular emphasis on the bending states and bending potential. New
   measurements extend the observed rotational lines to J=7<--6 for LiOH
   and J=8<--7 for LiOD for all bending vibrational states up to (03(3)0).
   Rotation-vibration energy levels, geometric expectation values, and
   dipole moments are calculated using extensive high-level ab initio
   three-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. Agreement
   between calculation and experiment is superb, with predicted B-v values
   typically within 0.3\%, D values within 0.2\%, q(l) values within 0.7\%,
   and dipole moments within 0.9\% of experiment. Shifts in B-v values with
   vibration and isotopic substitution are also well predicted. A combined
   theoretical and experimental structural analysis establishes the linear
   equilibrium structure with r(e)(Li-O)=1.5776(4) A and r(e)(O-H)=0.949(2)
   A. Predicted fundamental vibrational frequencies are v(1)=923.2,
   v(2)=318.3, and v(3)=3829.8 cm(-1) for LiOH and v(1)=912.9, v(2)=245.8,
   and v(3)=2824.2 cm(-1) for LiOD. The molecule is extremely nonrigid with
   respect to angular deformation; the calculated deviation from linearity
   for the vibrationally averaged structure is 19.0degrees in the (000)
   state and 41.9degrees in the (03(3)0) state. The calculation not only
   predicts, in agreement with previous work {[}P. R. Bunker, P. Jensen, A.
   Karpfen, and H. Lischka, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 135, 89 (1989)], a change
   from a linear to a bent minimum energy configuration at elongated Li-O
   distances, but also a similar change from linear to bent at elongated
   O-H distances. }},

Title = {Alkali element chemistry in cool dwarf atmospheres},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {1999},
Volume = {519},
Pages = {793-801},
Abstract = {The equilibrium thermochemistry of the alkali elements in cool dwarf
   atmospheres is investigated as part of a comprehensive set of chemical
   equilibrium calculations. The abundances of all important gases and the
   condensation temperatures of a:ll initial condensates for Li, Na, K, Rb,
   and Cs are calculated as a function of pressure and temperature. Also
   discussed is the chemistry of refractory elements such as Al, Ca, Cr,
   Fe, Mg, Si, Ti, and V. The calculation of the alkali element and
   refractory element chemistry can help to constrain pressure and
   temperature conditions in dwarf atmospheres. A relative temperature
   scale is developed and compared to recent observations of the alkali
   elements in late-type dwarfs and brown dwarfs, such as the DENIS objects
   and Gliese 229B. The calculations show (1) Atomic Li gas abundances are
   expected to be lower than the bulk Li abundance because LiOH gas (at
   high total pressure) or LiCl gas (at low total pressure) form in very
   cool objects. Observations of only monatomic Li are therefore not a good
   test for the substellar nature of very cool objects. (2) The
   observations of atomic Cs in Gliese 229B can be understood by
   considering the distribution of Cs between atomic Cs and CsCl gases. (3)
   Liquid condensates, which may form solutions with complex compositions,
   form at higher pressures, and need to be considered in further
   atmospheric structure and opacity modeling.},
