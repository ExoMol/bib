Abstract = {An expert system for automatic identification of the complex
   vibrational-rotational spectra of molecules has been developed. An
   iteration approach is implemented in this system, in which employment of
   the exact combination rule is combined with determination of the
   spectroscopic constants by solving of the inverse problems and
   comparison of the calculated parameters of spectral lines with the
   corresponding measured values. In order to calculate the energy levels
   and the frequencies and intensities of lines, the Watson Hamiltonian,
   the Pade-Borel approximants, and generating functions are used. The
   system is based on the application of pattern-recognition algorithms.
   Recognition training, makes it possible to obtain the required
   flexibility of the system and to use different methods of identification
   based on the application of combination rules both for the analysis of
   strong bands and for the assignment of weak single lines. The system
   developed can be used to analyze the spectra of the C-s and C-2v
   molecules, as well as employ the calculated spectrum of a molecule of
   any type prepared in advance. This system was successfully used to
   identify the (H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-17, (H2O)-O-18, D2O, HDO, (H2S)-S-32,
   (H2S)-S-34, and (H2S)-S-33 molecules. (C) 2003 MAIK
