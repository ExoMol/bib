Abstract = {Accurate modeling of mid-infrared vibrational-rotational transition
   spectra is pivotal for detecting biosignatures and prebiotic molecules
   in exoplanetary atmospheres. Conventional line-by-line radiative
   transfer methods encounter prohibitive computational costs when
   generating high-resolution spectra across extensive parameter spaces,
   particularly limiting real-time atmospheric retrieval and large-scale
   exoplanet surveys. To address these challenges, a physics-informed deep
   learning framework was developed for rapid and precise spectral
   generation. The architecture incorporates three key components: A
   parameter-encoding layer establishing global correlations between
   temperature-pressure conditions and spectral line parameters; Multi-head
   self-attention mechanisms capturing long-range dependencies in
   vibrational-rotational features; A physics-constrained decoder
   incorporating residual modules derived from lineprofileequationsto
   minimizenon-physicaldeviations. The frameworkdemonstrated successful
   reconstruction of molecular absorption cross-sections from the HITRAN
   database at 0.01cm-1 resolution, achieving a 100x acceleration compared
   to conventional HAPI simulations while maintainingspectral fidelity. The
   frameworkaccurately preserved fundamental spectroscopic principles,
   including line intensity scaling and rotational temperature
   dependencies, across diverse atmospheric conditions. This approach
   represents the first integration of spectroscopic constraints into
   neural network-based spectral generation, enabling interpretable
   temperature-pressure-spectral correlationsand
   compatibilitywithphotochemical network-driven biosignatureassessments.
   The method now provides a computationally efficient solution for
   next-generation spectral databases, significantly advancing molecular
   characterization of exoplanetary environments and enhancing biosignature
   detection systems through photochemical network integration.},

Title = {Machine Learning for Molecular Simulation},
Journal = {Annual Review of Physical Chemistry},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {361-390},
Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is transforming all areas of science. 
   The complex and time-consuming calculations in molecular simulations are 
   particularly suitable for an ML revolution and have already been profoundly
   affected by the application of existing ML methods. Here we review recent
   ML methods for molecular simulation, with particular focus on (deep) neural
   networks for the prediction of quantum-mechanical energies and forces, on 
   coarse-grained molecular dynamics, on the extraction of free energy surfaces 
   and kinetics, and on generative network approaches to sample molecular 
   equilibrium structures and compute thermodynamics. To explain these methods
   and illustrate open methodological problems, we review some important 
   principles of molecular physics and describe how they can be incorporated
   into ML structures. Finally, we identify and describe a list of open 
   challenges for the interface between ML and molecular simulation.},

Title = {An expert system for identification of lines in vibrational-rotational
   spectra},
Journal = {OPTICS AND SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {528-537},
Abstract = {An expert system for automatic identification of the complex
   vibrational-rotational spectra of molecules has been developed. An
   iteration approach is implemented in this system, in which employment of
   the exact combination rule is combined with determination of the
   spectroscopic constants by solving of the inverse problems and
   comparison of the calculated parameters of spectral lines with the
   corresponding measured values. In order to calculate the energy levels
   and the frequencies and intensities of lines, the Watson Hamiltonian,
   the Pade-Borel approximants, and generating functions are used. The
   system is based on the application of pattern-recognition algorithms.
   Recognition training, makes it possible to obtain the required
   flexibility of the system and to use different methods of identification
   based on the application of combination rules both for the analysis of
   strong bands and for the assignment of weak single lines. The system
   developed can be used to analyze the spectra of the C-s and C-2v
   molecules, as well as employ the calculated spectrum of a molecule of
   any type prepared in advance. This system was successfully used to
   identify the (H2O)-O-16, (H2O)-O-17, (H2O)-O-18, D2O, HDO, (H2S)-S-32,
   (H2S)-S-34, and (H2S)-S-33 molecules. (C) 2003 MAIK
