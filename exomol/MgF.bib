abstract = "An extended Morse oscillator (EMO) potential function was obtained by fitting the observed laboratory vibration-rotation and pure rotational spectra of the 24MgF X2Σ+ ground state. The fitted potential reproduces the observed transitions within the observation uncertainties. With this EMO potential and an analytic dipole moment function in the form of a Padé approximant fitted using ab initio dipole moment data, line lists for 24MgF, 25MgF and 26MgF were computed for v≤8, N≤100, Δv=0–8. It was discovered that directly using the ab initio dipole moment points with cubic spline interpolation to calculate line intensities worked for Δv<3, but failed for higher Δv values. A simple solution was found by fitting the ab initio dipole points with a suitable analytical dipole moment function. The calculated emission spectra are in good agreement with an observed laboratory spectrum with the MgF sample at 1823K."
