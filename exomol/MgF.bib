abstract = "An extended Morse oscillator (EMO) potential function was obtained by fitting the observed laboratory vibration-rotation and pure rotational spectra of the 24MgF X2Σ+ ground state. The fitted potential reproduces the observed transitions within the observation uncertainties. With this EMO potential and an analytic dipole moment function in the form of a Padé approximant fitted using ab initio dipole moment data, line lists for 24MgF, 25MgF and 26MgF were computed for v≤8, N≤100, Δv=0–8. It was discovered that directly using the ab initio dipole moment points with cubic spline interpolation to calculate line intensities worked for Δv<3, but failed for higher Δv values. A simple solution was found by fitting the ab initio dipole points with a suitable analytical dipole moment function. The calculated emission spectra are in good agreement with an observed laboratory spectrum with the MgF sample at 1823K."

Title = {New CrH opacities for the study of L and brown dwarf atmospheres},
Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {In this paper, we calculate new line lists and opacities for the 12
   bands of the A(6)Sigma(+)-X(6)Sigma(+) transitions of the CrH molecule.
   Identified in objects of the new L dwarf spectroscopic class (many of
   which are brown dwarfs), as well as in sunspots, the CrH molecule plays
   an important role in the diagnosis of low-temperature atmospheres. As a
   tentative first application of these opacities, we employ our new
   theoretical CrH data in an atmospheres code to obtain a CrH/H-2 number
   ratio for the skin of the L5 dwarf 2MASSI J1507038-151648 of similar
   to(2-4) x 10(-9), in rough agreement with chemical equilibrium
   expectations. Since in previous compilations the oscillator strength was
   off by more than an order of magnitude, this agreement represents a
   modest advance. However, in order to fit the CrH abundance in the L
   dwarf spectral class, silicate clouds need to be incorporated into the
   model. Given that this subject is still in a primitive stage of
   development, one should view any spectral model in the L dwarf range as
   merely tentative. Nevertheless, a necessary first step in L dwarf
   modeling is a reliable CrH opacity algorithm, and this is what we have
   here attempted to provide.},
