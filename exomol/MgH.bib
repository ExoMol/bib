Abstract = {{We study the electronic and hyperfine structures of (MgH)-Mg-24
   molecule, which are of crucial importance for the laser cooling of the
   molecule. The accurate spectroscopic constants and hyperfine levels are
   presented for X-2 Sigma(+) and A(2)Pi symmetries. The theoretical
   results are in good agreement with the experimental data. We then
   provide a scheme for the laser-driven cycling transitions of A(2)Pi(1/2)
   <- X-1/2(2 Sigma). In addition, we calculate the hyperfine branching
   ratios for the rate of decay from vertical bar A(2)Pi(1/2), J' = 1/2, +>
   to vertical bar X-2 Sigma(1/2), N = 1, -> transition. We also provide a
   sideband modulation scheme to the pumping lasers to match all four
   hyperfine levels of the X-2 Sigma(1/2) (v = 0, N = 1). Finally, we
   calculate the Zeeman shift of the (X-2 Sigma(1/2), v = 0, N = 1) ground
   state, and the typical hyperfine structure magnetic g factor g(F) and
   mixed g factors geff F are also calculated. Our study is expected to be
   useful for the laser-cooling (MgH)-Mg-24 molecule and the interpretation
   of astronomical spectra involving MgH molecule.}},

   the anion in photodetachment experiments after its confinement in cold
   ion traps. The calculations suggest that the electron affinity value is
   in agreement with an existing early experiment and, further, places on
   it an error bar smaller than that given before. Accurate

using direct absorption techniques. These free radicals were synthesized by the
reaction of metal vapor, generated in a Broida-type oven, with H2 in a dc discharge.
The N = 0 → 1 and N = 1 → 2 transitions were recorded for both species in the
frequency range 342–789 GHz. Spin–rotation and metal and proton hyperfine interactions
were resolved in the spectra. From these data, rotational, fine structure, and hyperfine
constants were determined, including the Fermi contact, dipolar, and electric quadrupole
parameters of the 25Mg and 67Zn nuclei. Comparison of the metal and proton hyperfine
terms suggests that the unpaired electron resides in a σ molecular orbital that
has significant s contributions from both the metal and the hydrogen atoms. The
dipolar terms for both metals are relatively large, in contrast to those of the
proton, and indicate spσ and possibly sdσ (zinc only) orbital hybridization. The
quadrupole constants arise principally from the p/d orbital character of the
unpaired electron, although there is a non-negligible polarization contribution.
These results suggest significant covalent character in both MgH and ZnH, in
contrast to their fluoride analogs.}

Abstract = {{New high-resolution visible Fourier transform emission spectra of the A

   earlier results for 24MgH in a multi-isotopologue direct-potential-fit
   analysis to yield improved analytic potential energy and
   Born-Oppenheimer breakdown functions for the ground X 2r state of MgH.
   Vibrational levels of the ground state of 24MgD were observed up to
   v{''} = 15, which is bound by only 30.6 +/- 0.10 cm(-1). Including
   deuteride and minor magnesium isotopologue data allowed us also to
   determine the adiabatic Born-Openheimer breakdown effects in this
   molecule. The fitting procedure used the recently developed
   Morse/Long-Range (MLR) potential energy function, whose asymptotic
   behavior incorporates the correct inverse-power form. A spin-splitting
   radial correction function to take account of the 2E spin-rotation
   interaction was also determined. Our refined value for the ground-state
   dissociation energy of the dominant isotopologue (24MgH) is De = 11
   104.25 +/- 0.8 cm(-1) I, in which the uncertainty also accounts for the
   model dependence of the fitted De values for a range of physically
   acceptable fits. We were also able to determine the marked difference in
   the well depths of 24MgH and (24)/MgD (with the deuteride potential
   curve being 7.58 +/- 0.30 cm(-1) deeper than that of the hydride) as
   well as smaller well-depth differences for the minor Mg-25'26
   isotopologues. This analytic potential function also predicts that the
   highest bound level of (MgD)-Mg-24 is v{''} = 16 and that it is bound by
   only 2.73 +/- 0.10 cm(-1.)}},

   results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere. The
   condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently
   removing Fe- bearing species from the gas phase. Monatomic Fe is the
   most abundant Fe- bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L
   dwarfs, and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Mg-
   and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by
   forsterite (Mg(2)SiO(4)) and enstatite (MgSiO(3)) cloud formation.
   Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of

   dwarfs. Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in
   the deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs and EGPs, whereas SiH(4) is
   dominant in the deep atmosphere of Jupiter and other gas giant planets.
   Several other Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases become increasingly

   properties of the MgH(+) ion. We first determine potential energy curves
   for several states using different basis sets and discuss their
   predicted accuracy by comparing our values of the well depths and
   position with other available results. We then calculate permanent and
   transition dipole moments for several transitions. Finally, for the
   first time, we calculate the static dipole polarizability of MgH(+) as a
   function of the interatomic distance. This study represents the first
   step towards the modelling of collisions between trapped cold Mg(+) ions
   and H(2) molecules.},

Abstract = {New high-resolution visible emission spectra of the MgH molecule have

   spectrometer. Many bands of the A (II)-I-2 -> X (2)Sigma(+) and B'
   (2)Sigma(+) -> X (2)Sigma(+) electronic transitions of (MgH)-Mg-24 were
   analyzed; the new data span the v' = 0-3 levels of the A (II)-I-2 and
   B'(2)Sigma(+) excited states and the v `' = 0-11 levels of the X
   (2)Sigma(+) ground electronic state. The vibration-rotation energy
   levels of the perturbed A (II)-I-2 and B' (2)Sigma(+) states were fitted
   as individual term values, while those of the X (2)Sigma(+) ground state
   were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic
   potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct
   attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that
   includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a
   significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of
   MgH was obtained. The v `' = 11 level of the X (2)Sigma(+) ground
   electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of
   24 MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The
   equilibrium dissociation energy for the X (2)Sigma(+) ground state of
   (MgH)-Mg-24 has been determined to, be D-e = 11104.7 +/- 0.5 cm(-1)
   (1.37681 +/- 0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v `' = 0) is

Title = {Collisional influence on the differential Hanle effect method applied to
   the second solar spectrum of the A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) (0,0) band of MgH},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {458},
Pages = {625-633},
Abstract = {Aims. This paper presents an analysis of the Q(1,2)( 6-12) lines of the
   Q band of the A(2)Pi-X-2 Sigma(+) ( 0, 0) transition of MgH, whose
   linear polarization was measured 4 arcsec inside the solar limb in a
   quiet region ( North Pole) with THEMIS on 21 November 2004.
   Methods. This analysis is performed as follows: a) the Hanle effect
   Gamma(H) parameter is derived by applying the differential Hanle effect
   method between the two extreme pairs of lines. Assuming no depolarizing
   collisions, a magnetic field strength follows, which is found to be 9.2
   Gauss, in agreement with previous observations of the same kind; b) this
   GH parameter is entered in a code solving the NLTE polarized radiative
   transfer equations, and the other depolarizing parameter, namely the
   depolarizing collision rate, is then derived by adjusting the computed
   polarization to the observed one. Thus an average value of the rate per
   colliding hydrogen atom a( 2) = 1.20 x 10(-9) cm(3) s(-1) is obtained
   for the upper levels of the 12 lines ( standard deviation 0.21 x 10(-9)
   cm(3) s(-1)). The corresponding model-dependent depolarizing rate is D(
   2) = ( 4.2 +/- 0.7) x 10(7) s(-1) at h = 200 km; c) this depolarizing
   rate is now introduced in the conversion of the GH parameter in terms of
   magnetic field strength: an average turbulent field strength of 29 +/-
   12 Gauss is derived as the final value, at height h = 200 +/- 80 km
   where the polarization is formed. The Honl-London factors of the lines
   under interest have been recalculated, leading to detect an error of a
   factor 2 in the recent literature.
   Results. The derived value B = 29 +/- 12 Gauss at h = 200 +/- 80 km is
   in fairly good agreement with the previous determinations based on the
   interpretation of the Sr I 4607 angstrom limb polarization, which has
   led to fields in the range 35-60 Gauss.
   Conclusions. Given the error bars, it seems unnecessary to put forward
   different formation regions for the Sr I and MgH lines.},

Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {The analysis of the Hanle effect in solar molecular lines allows us to
   obtain empirical information on hidden, mixed-polarity magnetic fields
   at subresolution scales in the (granular) upflowing regions of the
   ``quiet{''} solar photosphere. Here we report that collisions seem to be
   very efficient in depolarizing the rotational levels of MgH lines. This
   has the interesting consequence that in the upflowing regions of the
   quiet solar photosphere the strength of the hidden magnetic field cannot
   be much larger than 10 G, assuming the simplest case of a single-valued
   microturbulent field that fills the entire upflowing photospheric
   volume. Alternatively, an equally good theoretical fit to the observed
   scattering polarization amplitudes can be achieved by assuming that the
   rate of depolarizing collisions is an order of magnitude smaller than in
   the previous collisionally dominated case, but then the required
   strength of the hidden field in the upflowing regions turns out to be
   unrealistically high. These constraints reinforce our previously
   obtained conclusion that there is a vast amount of hidden magnetic
   energy and unsigned magnetic flux localized in the (intergranular)
   downflowing regions of the quiet solar photosphere.},

Title = {The limiting effects of dust in brown dwarf model atmospheres},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2001},
Volume = {556},
Pages = {357-372},
Abstract = {We present opacity sampling model atmospheres, synthetic spectra, and
   colors for brown dwarfs and very low mass stars in the following two
   limiting cases of dust grain formation: (1) Inefficient gravitational
   settling (i.e., the dust is distributed according to the chemical
   equilibrium predictions) and (2) efficient gravitational settling (i.e.,
   the dust forms and depletes refractory elements from the gas, but their
   opacity does not affect the thermal structure). The models include the
   formation of over 600 gas-phase species and 1000 liquids and crystals
   and the opacities of 30 different types of grains including corundum the
   magnesium aluminum spinel MgAl2O4, iron, enstatite (MgSiO3), forsterite
   (Mg2SiO4), amorphous carbon, SiC, and a number of calcium silicates. The
   models extend from the beginning of the grain formation regime well into
   the condensation regime of water ice (T-eff = 3000-100 K) and encompass
   the range of log g = 2.5-6.0 at solar metallicity. We find that silicate
   dust grains can form abundantly in the outer atmospheric layers of red
   and brown dwarfs with a spectral type later than M8. The greenhouse
   effects of dust opacities provide a natural explanation for the
   peculiarly red spectroscopic distribution of the latest M dwarfs and
   young brown dwarfs. The grainless (cond) models, on the other hand,
   correspond closely to methane brown dwarfs such as Gliese 229B. We also
   discover that the lambda lambda 5891, 5897 Na I D and lambda lambda
   7687, 7701 K I resonance doublets play a critical role in T dwarfs, in
   which their red wings define the pseudocontinuum from the I to the Z
   bandpass.},

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2001},
Volume = {105},
Pages = {41-47},
Abstract = {In the reaction of Mg(3s3p(1)P(1)) with H-2, we have constructed a new
   version of ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) for 2A' and 1A'
   states and their corresponding fit energy functions, on which 50 000
   trajectory calculations are performed. The improvement of the current
   quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations has made dynamical
   parameters more reliable than those reported previously. For instance,
   the obtained bimodal rotational distribution of MgH (v = 0), with a peak
   ratio of ca. 2:1 for the high-N to low-N components, is consistent with
   the experimental findings. The evaluated vibrational population ratio of
   ca. 0.52 for v = 1 to v = 0 is also within the range of observation, 0.7
   +/- 0.2. In addition, this work provides new information about the
   formation of MgH rotational levels via the angular momentum analysis.
   The trajectory calculations reveals the relation of the rotational
   distribution to the impact parameter, b, and the relative angle,
   epsilon, between the orbital and rotational angular momenta of the
   products. The MgH is preferentially populated in the high-Ar levels at
   small b but favors the low-N distribution at acute-angle (<90<degrees>)
   epsilon. The analysis of vector correlation provides insight into the
   behavior of the MgH rotational population.},

Abstract = {The polarimetric observations of the quiet Sun show linear polarization

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {1999},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {7938-7948},
Abstract = {Quasi-classical trajectory calculations for the reaction of
   Mg(3s3p(1)P(1)) with H-2 are performed on two potential energy surfaces
   (PES), the excited state (1)A' (or B-1(2) in the C-2v symmetry) in the
   entrance channel and the ground state (1)A' (or (1)A(1)) in the exit
   channel. A many-body expansion procedure is adopted for the construction
   of the analytical fit functions from the ab initio results. The title
   reaction involves a nonadiabatic transition between the two potential
   surfaces. For simplicity, the transition probability is assumed to be
   unity when the trajectory goes through the region of surface crossing
   and changes to the lower surface. The calculated total collisional
   deactivation and reaction cross sections decrease with the increase of
   translational collision energy. The calculated rotational product
   distributions are characterized by a bimodal feature both fur the MgH v
   = 0 and 1 states. The trend of bimodality is consistent with the
   observation reported in experimental studies. Our inspection of
   individual trajectories reveals that the low-rotational and
   high-rotational populations are caused by two distinct reaction
   pathways. This observation supports our previous expectation for the
   microscopic branching via the PES anisotropy. The angular product
   distribution indicates that the reaction proceeds predominantly via a
   linear collision complex. An increase of the collision energy from 2.026
   to 8.104 kcal/mol has resulted in a shift of the distribution toward
   forward direction. The vibrational product distribution tends to
   decrease with the quantum numbers. The ratio of MgH(v = 1) to MgH(v = 0)
   yields a value of similar to 0.3, which is nevertheless underestimated
   as compared with the observation of 0.7 +/- 0.2. The reasons for the
   discrepancy are also discussed.},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {264},
Pages = {334-344},
Abstract = {Surface gravities are deduced for Arcturus and five other cool giant
   stars. A temperature and an overall abundance are adopted for each
   object and the surface gravity is then found by requiring the magnesium
   abundance derived from Mg I features to match that derived from MgH. The
   contamination of the MgH features by lines of the C2 system is allowed
   for. The values obtained by this method are compared with those found by
   other spectroscopic methods that use Fe ionization equilibria and the
   pro files of strong lines. The errors inherent in the molecular
   equilibrium methods are discussed. The surface gravities found from
   radii derived from parallaxes and angular diameters, and an assumed mass
   of 1 M., are compared with the spectroscopic results. The results for
   Arcturus are also compared with those found from the molecular
   equilibrium method applied to oxygen features. All the determinations
   discussed here use a consistent set of theoretical, LTE, flux-constant,
   line-blanketed model atmospheres, and the differences in the results are
   taken to be evidence for non-LTE effects. It is suggested that these
   comparisons indicate a range of spectral types for which non-LTE effects
   are important.
   A supplemental abundance analysis for one of the giant stars (phi2Ori)
   is also presented.},

Abstract = {The possibility of using MgH lines as a gravity criterion for red giant
   atmospheres is considered. High-resolution spectra of twelve K0-K3
   giants were obtained with the CCD camera in the coude spectrograph of
   the Shajn telescope. The effective temperatures T(ef) of these giants
   have been determined from (Y-K) colors, and the gravities 1g g have been
   obtained from the comparison of observed and calculated equivalent
   widths if MgH features with the wavelengths 5134,6; 5138,7, 5140,2
   angstrom angstrom. The results of the investigation of the influence of
   some parameters (micro- and macroturbulence, metallicity, abundance of
   Mg etc.) on the calculated MgH line profiles are discussed. The values
   of T(ef) and Ig g are compared with those obtained by other methods and
   published ones. The calibration diagrams for the determination of
   gravities of red giants with T(ef) from 4000 K to 5000 K from the
   equivalent widths and the central intensities of MgH lines are proposed.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {1991},
Volume = {102},
Pages = {777-786},
Abstract = {Two accompanying papers have used synthetic spectra to discuss the
   calibration of CO band indices and the C(41-42), C(42-45) and C(45-48),
   C(42-45) diagrams of the DDO photometric system.  The band passes of the
   latter system are strongly influenced by lines of CN, CH, MgH, and SiH,
   with the SiH lines affecting the 41 pass band in dwarfs.  Simple
   formulas which make predictions of the strengths of these lines are
   discussed.  The results of these formulas are compared with approximate
   calculations of the ratio of line to continuous absorption coefficients
   in the stellar atmospheres.  Some discussion of the depth dependence of
   the different molecular abundances is also given.  The luminosity
   dependence of the CO bands is shown to be a consequence of the lower
   continuous absorption coefficient in giant star atmospheres as compared
   to dwarfs.  The lesser depletion of carbon by CO formation and lower
   continuous opacity in giants with T(eff) < 4500 K leads to them having
   stronger CN and CH bands than the corresponding dwarfs.  The need to
   include an enhanced nitrogen abundance to explain the observed CN band
   strengths in the hotter giants can be understood.  The relative
   importance of CH as a continuous opacity source is considered.  The SiH
   lines are shown to vary strongly with T(eff) and log g, in a manner
   similar to that of the MgH lines.},
