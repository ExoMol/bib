Abstract = {{The authors report here the implementation of a newly developed, highly
   efficient matrix diagonalization routine in the DR program {[}T. E.
   Odaka et al., J. Mol. Struct. 795, 14 (2006)]. The DR program solves the
   rovibronic Schrodinger equation for a triatomic molecule with a double
   Renner effect, i.e., with two accessible linear arrangements of the
   nuclei at which the electronic energy is doubly degenerate. With the new
   routines, the authors can extend the DR calculations of rovibronic
   energies for A(2)II MgNC/MgCN by considering a much larger set of
   rovibronic states, in particular, states at higher J values, than the
   authors were able to access previously.}},
