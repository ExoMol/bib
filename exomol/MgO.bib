  journal = ApJ,
  year = {2003},
  volume = {598},
  pages = {785-803},
  abstract = {Dust grains play a crucial role in the formation and evolution history
   of stars and galaxies in the early universe. We investigate the
   formation of dust grains in the ejecta of Population III supernovae,
   including pair-instability supernovae, which are expected to occur in
   the early universe, applying a theory of non steady state nucleation and
   grain growth. Dust formation calculations are performed for
   core-collapse supernovae with progenitor mass M(pr) ranging from 13 to
   30 M. and for pair-instability supernovae with M(pr) = 170 and 200 M..
   In the calculations, the time evolution of gas temperature in the
   ejecta, which strongly affects the number density and size of newly
   formed grains, is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation,
   taking account of the energy deposition of radioactive elements. Two
   extreme cases are considered for the elemental composition in the
   ejecta, unmixed and uniformly mixed cases within the He core, and
   formation of CO and SiO molecules is assumed to be complete. The results
   of calculations for core-collapse supernovae and pair-instability
   supernovae are summarized as follows: in the unmixed ejecta, a variety
   of grain species condense, reflecting the difference of the elemental
   composition at the formation site in the ejecta; otherwise only oxide
   grains condense in the uniformly mixed ejecta. The average size of newly
   formed grains spans a range of 3 orders of magnitude, depending on the
   grain species and the formation condition, and the maximum radius is
   limited to less than 1 mum, which does not depend on the progenitor
   mass. The size distribution function of each grain species is
   approximately lognormal, except for Mg silicates, MgO, Si, and FeS in
   the unmixed case and Al(2)O(3) in both cases. The size distribution
   function summed up over all grain species is approximated by a power-law
   formula whose index is -3.5 for the larger radius and -2.5 for the
   smaller one; the radius at the crossover point ranges from 0.004 to 0.1
   mum, depending on the model of supernovae. The fraction of mass locked
   into dust grains increases with increasing the progenitor mass: 2\%-5\%
   of the progenitor mass for core-collapse supernovae and 15\%-30\% for
   pair-instability supernovae whose progenitor mass ranges from 140 to 260
   M.. Thus, if very massive stars populated the first generation of stars
   ( Population III stars), a large amount of dust grains would be produced
   in the early universe. We also discuss the dependence of the explosion
   energy and the amount of (56)Ni in the ejecta, as well as the efficiency
   of formation of CO and SiO molecules, on the formation of dust grains in
   the ejecta of supernovae.},

In this work, the cross-sections and rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+, \\$\\{\\rm X\\}^1\\Sigma ^+\\, \\rightarrow \\, \\{\\rm A\\}^1\\Pi\\$, D1Δ → A1Π, a3Π → e3Σ−, \\$\\{\\rm X\\}^1\\Sigma ^+\\, \\rightarrow \\, \\{\\rm X\\}^1\\Sigma ^+\\$, and A1Π → A1Π radiative association processes of forming MgO are theoretically estimated. The cross-sections for the transitions between the different states are obtained by using the semiclassical method for direct contributions and the Breit–Wigner theory as a complement for resonance contributions. For the transitions between the same states, the quantum mechanical method is used. The rate coefficients are then obtained from the cross-sections for the temperatures in the range of 10–10 000 K and the results are found to vary from 4.69 \\$\\times \\, 10^\\{-16\\}\\$ to 6.27 \\$\\times \\, 10^\\{-14\\}\\$ cm3 s−1. For temperatures lower than around 693 K, the rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+ process are dominant, which indicates this process is the most efficient way of producing MgO at low temperatures. However, the rate coefficients for the D1Δ → A1Π process go through a rapid increase with increasing temperature and become dominant at higher temperatures. For other processes, their rate coefficients are several orders of magnitude lower than those for the two processes mentioned above. The results can be used to further investigate the formation and evolution of MgO in low density and hot gas close to the photosphere of evolved oxygen-rich stars.},

using cluster models of the MgO crystal. Several different clusters were used;
in general, the clusters contained a central Mg atom, one or more shells of
nearest-neighbor Mg and O atoms, and a large number of point charges to represent
the Madelung potential in the space of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster.
The excited orbital was occupied in two ways. First, an electron was added to a
low lying excited level while the Mg2+ and O2- anion levels were kept fully occupied.
In the second way, an electron was excited from the oxygen 2p band into a low
lying excited level. The excited orbitals, for both of these cases are very similar.
Although the energetics of the excited states depended on the cluster model, in
particular whether it was Mg or O terminated, the general character of the excited
orbital remained the same. In all clusters, the excited state orbital was diffuse
and delocalized. The excited orbital has no simple or direct relationship to the 3s
orbital of Mg2+. It is best described as a `'conduction band'' orbital. It extends
up to and beyond the edge of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster. In our
work, we did not find any evidence for localized excitonic states.},

In the present study, only the first nonvanishing term with the order h2 is considered. As expected, quantum effects on the properties are found to become increasingly important with decreasing temperature. In view of the simplicity of the potential used, our simulation is quite successful in reproducing a wide range of measured properties of MgO, including the crystal structure, bulk modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity, and mean‐square atomic displacements over a wide temperature range above 500 K. However, at lower temperatures, both the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient of MgO are computed to decrease too sharply with decreasing temperature when compared with experiment.

corrections ψ1M and ψ1N. The zero and first order transition moments are calculated.
Selecting the most important determinants of ψ1M and ψ1N one is able to build
improved zero order wavefunctions for these two states and the process is iterated.
The method has been tested on several transitions of H2 and on the X1Σ+-B1Σ+
transition of MgO, showing the importance of the first order correction. The
stability of the results when the quality of the wavefunction is improved is satisfactory.
The results for several transitions of MgO are given; the result for the X1Σ+-B1Σ+ transition
is very different from an experimental estimate},

restriction version of the LCAO—MO—SCF method, using an extended double‐zeta basis
set, have been performed at a number of internuclear separations for six configurations,
in order to account for the features of the spectrum of MgO and to ascertain the
nature of the ground state. Most arguments coming from both experimental data and
theoretical calculations corrected by semiempirical estimates of correlation
energy differences between the configurations, are in favor of a closed‐shell 1Σ+
ground state, although the lowest Hartree—Fock state is a less correlated 3II
open‐shell state. Higher‐lying observed states (D1Δ and C1Σ−) as well as unobserved
ones up to the first ionization limit are accounted for by variational or reliable
virtual orbital calculations, and they are presented in an energy‐level diagram.
In this connection, the properties of the variational 2II and 2Σ+ low‐lying levels
of MgO+ are discussed. It is then suggested that, in view of this, the unclassified
ultraviolet bands should most likely be partly assigned to triplet—triplet transitions
involving the very low‐lying 3II state. Finally, reasonable predictions about other
as yet unobserved band systems are made},
