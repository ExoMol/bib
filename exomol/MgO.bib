abstract = {The photodissociation process of magnesium oxide (MgO) may be a main
source of the magnesium atom in planetary exospheres due to the impact events on

photodissociation of MgO for the transitions from the full range of rovibrational
levels of the X1Σ+ and a3Π states, where the photon wavelength ranged from 50 
to 5000 nm. The applications of the state-resolved cross-sections to the local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions were also investigated for the temperatures
ranging from 500 to 10 000 K. Based on the calculated LTE cross-sections, the
photodissociation rates in the interstellar, solar, and blackbody radiation fields
were obtained as well. The rates in all studied radiation fields increase with the
temperature increasing and are dominated by the e3Σ− ← a3Π and F1Π ← X1Σ+ transitions.
The knowledge of the photodissociation cross-sections and rates of MgO plays a key
role in the investigations of the chemical behaviour of the alkaline-earth element
Mg in planetary exospheres, atmospheres of cool stars, and envelopes of evolved stars.},

abstract = {The radiative association process for the formation of magnesium oxide (MgO) may be of great importance due to its frequent occurrence in the low-density and dust-poor astrochemical environments. In this work, the cross-sections and rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+, \\$\\{\\rm X\\}^1\\Sigma ^+\\, \\rightarrow \\, \\{\\rm A\\}^1\\Pi\\$, D1Δ → A1Π, a3Π → e3Σ−, \\$\\{\\rm X\\}^1\\Sigma ^+\\, \\rightarrow \\, \\{\\rm X\\}^1\\Sigma ^+\\$, and A1Π → A1Π radiative association processes of forming MgO are theoretically estimated. The cross-sections for the transitions between the different states are obtained by using the semiclassical method for direct contributions and the Breit–Wigner theory as a complement for resonance contributions. For the transitions between the same states, the quantum mechanical method is used. The rate coefficients are then obtained from the cross-sections for the temperatures in the range of 10–10 000 K and the results are found to vary from 4.69 \\$\\times \\, 10^\\{-16\\}\\$ to 6.27 \\$\\times \\, 10^\\{-14\\}\\$ cm3 s−1. For temperatures lower than around 693 K, the rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+ process are dominant, which indicates this process is the most efficient way of producing MgO at low temperatures. However, the rate coefficients for the D1Δ → A1Π process go through a rapid increase with increasing temperature and become dominant at higher temperatures. For other processes, their rate coefficients are several orders of magnitude lower than those for the two processes mentioned above. The results can be used to further investigate the formation and evolution of MgO in low density and hot gas close to the photosphere of evolved oxygen-rich stars.},

Journal = {Nature Geosci.},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {926-929},
Abstract = {Magnesium oxide is an important component of the Earth's mantle and has
   been extensively studied at pressures and temperatures relevant to
   Earth(1). However, much less is known about the behaviour of this oxide
   under conditions likely to occur in extrasolar planets with masses up to
   10 times that of Earth, termed super-Earths, where pressures can exceed
   1,000 GPa (10 million atmospheres). Magnesium oxide is expected to
   change from a rocksalt crystal structure (B1) to a caesium chloride (B2)
   structure at pressures of about 400-600 GPa (refs 2,3). Whereas no
   structural transformation was observed in static compression experiments
   up to 250 GPa (ref. 4), evidence for a solid-solid phase transition was
   obtained in shockwave experiments above 400 GPa and 9,000 K (ref. 5),
   albeit no structural measurements were made. As a result, the properties
   and the structure of MgO under conditions relevant to super-Earths and
   large planets are unknown. Here we present dynamic X-ray diffraction
   measurements of ramp-compressed magnesium oxide. We show that a
   solid-solid phase transition, consistent with a transformation to the B2
   structure, occurs near 600 GPa. On further compression, this structure
   remains stable to 900 GPa. Our results provide an experimental benchmark
   to the equations of state and transition pressure of magnesium oxide,
   and may help constrain mantle viscosity and convection in the deep
   mantle of extrasolar super-Earths.},

abstract = {We have conducted petrologic modeling of MESSENGER-derived compositions and analog compositions to gain a better understanding of the petrogenesis of the crust of Mercury. Analog compositions included a 1425°C partial melt of the Indarch (EH4) meteorite and a range of Mg-rich terrestrial rocks (magnesian basalt, basaltic komatiite, and peridotitic komatiite). All models were held at the iron-wüstite buffer to simulate the reducing conditions that likely existed during Mercury's formation. We then compared modeled mineral compositions and abundances, liquidus temperatures, and viscosities to better constrain the characteristics of the lavas that erupted on Mercury's surface. Our results show that the surface composition of Mercury is most similar to that of a terrestrial magnesian basalt (with lowered FeO), composed mainly of Mg-rich orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Because the model magmas are Mg-rich, their counterparts on Mercury would have erupted at high temperatures and displayed low viscosities. Producing melts of these compositions would have required high temperatures at the mantle source regions on Mercury. The inferred low-viscosity lavas would have erupted as thin, laterally extensive flows (depending upon their effusion rate) and would be expected to display surficial flow features that might be preserved to the present.},

	Fits to a Chamberlain exosphere reveal that at least two source temperatures

	this result suggests that another energetic process, such as the

   source process for the atoms observed in the tail and near-planet
   exosphere are consistent with ion sputtering and/or impact vaporization
   of a molecule with subsequent dissociation into the atomic form The
   extended Mg tall is consistent with a surface abundance of 5-8\% Mg by
   number. if 30\% of impact-vaporized Mg remains as MgO and half of the
   impact vapor condenses Globally, ion sputtering is not a major source of

   source We conclude that the Na and K in Mercury's exosphere can be
   derived from a regolith composition similar to that of Luna 16 soil (or

   0028) for Na and 0 0006 (0 0045) for K (C) Published by Elsevier Inc},

Abstract = {Amorphization of crystalline olivine to glass with a pyroxene

   serpentine-dehydroxylate with O/Si = 3.56 +/- 0.25, (Mg+Fe)/Si = 1.53
   +/- 0.24, and Mg/(Mg+Fe) = 0.74 +/- 0.1. These measured atomic ratios
   match the ratios that have been proposed for amorphous interstellar
   silicate grains very well, albeit the measured Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratio is lower
   than was proposed for amorphous interstellar silicate grains, Mg/(Mg+Fe)> 0.9.},

Title = {{Dust in the early universe: Dust formation in the ejecta of population
   III supernovae}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2003},
Volume = {598},
Pages = {785-803},
Abstract = {Dust grains play a crucial role in the formation and evolution history
   of stars and galaxies in the early universe. We investigate the
   formation of dust grains in the ejecta of Population III supernovae,
   including pair-instability supernovae, which are expected to occur in
   the early universe, applying a theory of non steady state nucleation and
   grain growth. Dust formation calculations are performed for
   core-collapse supernovae with progenitor mass M(pr) ranging from 13 to
   30 M. and for pair-instability supernovae with M(pr) = 170 and 200 M..
   In the calculations, the time evolution of gas temperature in the
   ejecta, which strongly affects the number density and size of newly
   formed grains, is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation,
   taking account of the energy deposition of radioactive elements. Two
   extreme cases are considered for the elemental composition in the
   ejecta, unmixed and uniformly mixed cases within the He core, and
   formation of CO and SiO molecules is assumed to be complete. The results
   of calculations for core-collapse supernovae and pair-instability
   supernovae are summarized as follows: in the unmixed ejecta, a variety
   of grain species condense, reflecting the difference of the elemental
   composition at the formation site in the ejecta; otherwise only oxide
   grains condense in the uniformly mixed ejecta. The average size of newly
   formed grains spans a range of 3 orders of magnitude, depending on the
   grain species and the formation condition, and the maximum radius is
   limited to less than 1 mum, which does not depend on the progenitor
   mass. The size distribution function of each grain species is
   approximately lognormal, except for Mg silicates, MgO, Si, and FeS in
   the unmixed case and Al(2)O(3) in both cases. The size distribution
   function summed up over all grain species is approximated by a power-law
   formula whose index is -3.5 for the larger radius and -2.5 for the
   smaller one; the radius at the crossover point ranges from 0.004 to 0.1
   mum, depending on the model of supernovae. The fraction of mass locked
   into dust grains increases with increasing the progenitor mass: 2\%-5\%
   of the progenitor mass for core-collapse supernovae and 15\%-30\% for
   pair-instability supernovae whose progenitor mass ranges from 140 to 260
   M.. Thus, if very massive stars populated the first generation of stars
   ( Population III stars), a large amount of dust grains would be produced
   in the early universe. We also discuss the dependence of the explosion
   energy and the amount of (56)Ni in the ejecta, as well as the efficiency
   of formation of CO and SiO molecules, on the formation of dust grains in
   the ejecta of supernovae.},

The cross-sections for the transitions between the different states are obtained by using the semiclassical method for direct contributions and the Breit–Wigner theory as a complement for resonance contributions. For the transitions between the same states, the quantum mechanical method is used. The rate coefficients are then obtained from the cross-sections for the temperatures in the range of 10–10 000 K and the results are found to vary from 4.69 \\$\\times \\, 10^\\{-16\\}\\$ to 6.27 \\$\\times \\, 10^\\{-14\\}\\$ cm3 s−1. For temperatures lower than around 693 K, the rate coefficients for the A1Π → X1Σ+ process are dominant, which indicates this process is the most efficient way of producing MgO at low temperatures. However, the rate coefficients for the D1Δ → A1Π process go through a rapid increase with increasing temperature and become dominant at higher temperatures. For other processes, their rate coefficients are several orders of magnitude lower than those for the two processes mentioned above. The results can be used to further investigate the formation and evolution of MgO in low density and hot gas close to the photosphere of evolved oxygen-rich stars.},

Abstract = {Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra of MgO- and ZnO- have been

   to photodetachment transitions from the MgO- and ZnO- ground state (X

   lying neutral excited states. In addition, a high-temperature MgO-
   spectrum shows spectral features due to photodetachment from an excited
   electronic state of the MgO- anion, which has been assigned to an
   A(2)Pi: anionic state. From the MgO- spectra, the electron affinity of
   the MgO ground state (X (1)Sigma (+)) is determined to be 1.630 (0.025)
   eV. Four electronic excited states of MgO, a(3)Pi, A(1)Pi, b(3)Sigma

   states, a(3)Pi and A(1)Pi, which have been found to lie 2460 and 4960
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) ground state, respectively. From
   Franck-Condon analyses of the well-resolved vibrational progressions for
   each electronic transition, equilibrium internuclear distances and
   fundamental vibrational frequencies of the MgO and ZnO neutral
   electronic states were determined. Moreover, because the sources

Abstract = {Extended measurements are reported for rovibronic transitions between
   the strongly mixed low-lying X(1) Sigma(+), a(3) Pi and A(1) Pi
   electronic states of the MgO molecule in the 1640-3510 cm(-1) region.
   The measurements were made with the Faraday laser magnetic resonance
   (LMR) technique utilizing a CO laser and a CO overtone laser. The new
   observed lines include the A(1) Pi-X(1) Sigma(+) (0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-2,
   1-3, 2-2, 2-4, 3-3) bands as well as the much weaker a(3) Pi(0,1)-X(1)
   Sigma(+) (0-0, 1-0) intercombination bands. The present highly precise
   LMR data provide a basis for performing an extensive deperturbation
   analysis including the spin-orbit, orbit-rotation and Zeeman
   interactions between the rovibronic levels of the X(1) Sigma(+) a(3) Pi
   and a(1) Pi states. Thereby the present data are combined with reliable
   earlier experimental results, in particular for the transitions
   involving higher lying vibronic states, in order to obtain the effective
   deperturbed molecular constants and perturbation parameters for the
   three lowest lying electronic states of MgO to as high an accuracy as
   possible. The absolute standard deviation of the LMR data is 6 x 10(-4)
   cm(-1) (18 MHz), which is in accord with the accuracy of our
   measurements. The set of deperturbed molecular parameters reproduces all
   measured lines with an overall standard deviation of 0.87 relative to
   the experimental uncertainties. For perturbations such as spin-orbit
   interaction there is good agreement with the predictions of large scale
   ab initio calculations.},

Journal = GCA,
Year = {1995},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {3413-3444},
Abstract = {The Berman (1983) activity-composition model for non-ideal liquid
   solutions in the CaO-MgO-Al2O5-SiO2 (CMAS) system is incorporated into
   equilibrium condensation calculations which are used to explore the
   vapor-solid-liquid stability relations as a function of temperature and
   total pressure (p(tot)) in a gas of solar composition, and as a function
   of temperature and dust/gas ratio at P-tot = 1 X 10(-3) atm in gases
   produced by total vaporization of systems enriched in interstellar dust
   relative to the gas compared to solar abundances. Condensate liquids are
   very non-ideal, suggesting that results of previous attempts to model
   their formation using ideal solution models are highly inaccurate. As is
   the case for the Berman (1983) liquid model itself, results of the
   present calculations are in very good agreement with experimentally
   determined liquid-crystal phase relations except where intermediate
   members of solid solution series, such as melilite and fassaite, are
   predicted to be in equilibrium with liquid, in which cases
   liquid-crystal equilibration temperatures are overestimated by 50 to 100
   K, CMAS liquids are stable in a solar gas at a P-tot least as low as 5 X
   10(-2) atm and perhaps as low as 1 X 10(-2) atm, much lower than
   previous estimates for liquids of pure forsterite composition, due to
   the colligative effects of CaO and Al2O3. CMAS liquids are stable at
   P-tot = 1 X 10(-3) atm in systems with dust/gas enrichment factors at
   least as low as 16 and perhaps as low as 5 relative to solar abundances.
   Results of these calculations suggest that, upon cooling, a solid
   melilite + spinel condensate assemblage, comparable to a Type A
   refractory inclusion, would react with the vapor to produce a liquid
   much richer in MgO and SiO2 than the starting material, at either
   elevated P-tot or enhanced dust/gas ratio, If this partial melt were
   isolated from further reaction with the nebular gas, it would solidify
   into a spinel + melilite + fassaite + anorthite assemblage, similar in
   chemical and mineralogical composition to a Type B refractory inclusion.
   Forsterite coexists stably with CMAS condensate liquids over wide ranges
   of P-tot and dust/gas ratio, extending to the lowest P-tot and dust/gas
   ratio at which liquids are stable. If the compositions of glass
   inclusions inside isolated forsterite crystals in the Murchison CM2
   chondrite have been modified by precipitation of 25 wt\% forsterite as a
   daughter mineral from the liquid precursors of those glasses, the
   inclusions could represent condensate liquids that were in equilibrium
   with forsterite at P-tot = 0.3 atm or at dust/gas enrichment factors of
   similar to 70 at P-tot = 1 X 10(-3) atm.},

abstract = {The character of low-lying excited states of MgO has been examined
using cluster models of the MgO crystal. Several different clusters were used;
in general, the clusters contained a central Mg atom, one or more shells of
nearest-neighbor Mg and O atoms, and a large number of point charges to represent
the Madelung potential in the space of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster.
The excited orbital was occupied in two ways. First, an electron was added to a
low lying excited level while the Mg2+ and O2- anion levels were kept fully occupied.
In the second way, an electron was excited from the oxygen 2p band into a low
lying excited level. The excited orbitals, for both of these cases are very similar.
Although the energetics of the excited states depended on the cluster model, in
particular whether it was Mg or O terminated, the general character of the excited
orbital remained the same. In all clusters, the excited state orbital was diffuse
and delocalized. The excited orbital has no simple or direct relationship to the 3s
orbital of Mg2+. It is best described as a `'conduction band'' orbital. It extends
up to and beyond the edge of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster. In our
work, we did not find any evidence for localized excitonic states.},

is low lying (Te = 2620.6 cm−1), it correlates to ground state atoms (unlike the
X1Σ+ state), it is the lower state of the exceedingly complex near UV triplet-triplet
bands, and many Mg + oxidant reactions significantly populate various , components
of the a3Π state. The fit model, observed transitions, and computed eigenvalues
and eigenvectors for MgO a3Π v = O and 1 will aid in the analysis of triplet-triplet
bands and will be especially valuable in providing transition frequencies and relative
and J-dependent rotational linestrength factors for population monitoring. The
present results reaffirm the validity and utility of various semiempirical relationships
between fine structure, Λ-doubling, and perturbation parameters. Moreover, by
showing that the Λ-doubling in the a3Π state is dominated by interactions with
the X1Σ+ and b3Σ+ states, an ab initio prediction of the location of the as yet

strength from the B1Σ+-X1Σ+ and B1Σ+-A1Π transitions. The pattern of a3Π, A1Π,

In the present study, only the first nonvanishing term with the order h2 is considered. As expected, quantum effects on the properties are found to become increasingly important with decreasing temperature. In view of the simplicity of the potential used, our simulation is quite successful in reproducing a wide range of measured properties of MgO, including the crystal structure, bulk modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, heat capacity, and mean‐square atomic displacements over a wide temperature range above 500 K. However, at lower temperatures, both the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient of MgO are computed to decrease too sharply with decreasing temperature when compared with experiment.

abstract = {The CIPSI (Configuration Interaction by Perturbation of a multiconfiguration

transition moments. At each step the wavefunction ψ0M and ψ0N for the states M
and N are perturbed to the first order by the remaining Cl leading to first order
corrections ψ1M and ψ1N. The zero and first order transition moments are calculated.
Selecting the most important determinants of ψ1M and ψ1N one is able to build
improved zero order wavefunctions for these two states and the process is iterated.
The method has been tested on several transitions of H2 and on the X1Σ+-B1Σ+
transition of MgO, showing the importance of the first order correction. The
stability of the results when the quality of the wavefunction is improved is satisfactory.
The results for several transitions of MgO are given; the result for the X1Σ+-B1Σ+ transition
is very different from an experimental estimate},

abstract = {Ab initio calculations based on Nesbet's symmetry and equivalence
restriction version of the LCAO—MO—SCF method, using an extended double‐zeta basis
set, have been performed at a number of internuclear separations for six configurations,
in order to account for the features of the spectrum of MgO and to ascertain the
nature of the ground state. Most arguments coming from both experimental data and
theoretical calculations corrected by semiempirical estimates of correlation
energy differences between the configurations, are in favor of a closed‐shell 1Σ+
ground state, although the lowest Hartree—Fock state is a less correlated 3II
open‐shell state. Higher‐lying observed states (D1Δ and C1Σ−) as well as unobserved
ones up to the first ionization limit are accounted for by variational or reliable
virtual orbital calculations, and they are presented in an energy‐level diagram.
In this connection, the properties of the variational 2II and 2Σ+ low‐lying levels
of MgO+ are discussed. It is then suggested that, in view of this, the unclassified
ultraviolet bands should most likely be partly assigned to triplet—triplet transitions
involving the very low‐lying 3II state. Finally, reasonable predictions about other
as yet unobserved band systems are made},
