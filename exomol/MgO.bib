   Mg and O production},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Abstract = {We used multiconfigurational methods and a large basis set to compute
   the potential energy curves of the valence and valence-Rydberg
   electronic states of MgO molecule. New bound electronic states are
   found. Using these highly correlated wave functions, we evaluated their
   mutual spin-orbit couplings and transition moment integrals. For the
   bound electronic states of MgO, we deduced an accurate set of
   spectroscopic constants that agree remarkably well with experimental
   results. Moreover, our potentials, transition moments, and spin-orbit
   coupling evolutions are incorporated into Fermi golden rule calculations
   to deduce the radiative lifetimes of MgO(B (1)Sigma(+)) rovibrational
   levels and the natural lifetimes of MgO(A (1)Pi) vibrational levels,
   where a good agreement is found with experimental values. Finally, we
   suggest new routes for the production of cold Mg and O atoms and cold
   MgO molecules. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {Geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and bond
   dissociation energies are predicted for the simple alkaline earth (Be,

   cluster theory {[}CCSD(T)] level including core-valence correlation with
   the aug-cc-pwCVnZ basis sets up to n = 5 in some cases. Additional
   corrections (scalar relativistic effects, vibrational zero-point
   energies, and atomic spin-orbit effects) were necessary to accurately
   calculate the total atomization energies and heats of formation. The
   calculated geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and
   bond dissociation energies are compared with the available experimental
   data. For a number of these alkaline earth compounds, the experimental
   geometries and energies are not reliable. MgF(2) and BeF(2) are
   predicted to be linear and CaF(2) is predicted to be bent. BeOH is
   predicted to be bent, whereas MgOH and CaOH are linear. The OBeO angle
   in Be(OH)(2) is not linear, and the molecule has C(2), symmetry. The
   heat of formation at 298 K for MgO is calculated to be 32.3 kcal/mol,

Pages = {5709-5718},
Abstract = {Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra of MgO- and ZnO- have been
   recorded at several photon energies under varied experimental
   conditions. Peaks in these highly structured spectra have been assigned
   to photodetachment transitions from the MgO- and ZnO- ground state (X
   (2)Sigma (+)) to vibrational progressions in the ground and several low
   lying neutral excited states. In addition, a high-temperature MgO-
   spectrum shows spectral features due to photodetachment from an excited
   electronic state of the MgO- anion, which has been assigned to an
   A(2)Pi: anionic state. From the MgO- spectra, the electron affinity of
   the MgO ground state (X (1)Sigma (+)) is determined to be 1.630 (0.025)
   eV. Four electronic excited states of MgO, a(3)Pi, A(1)Pi, b(3)Sigma
   (+), and B(1)Sigma (+), were found to lie 2510, 3390, 8390; and 20 000
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) neutral ground state, respectively. The
   excited MgO- A(2)Pi anion state was found to lie 4791 cm(-1) above the
   MgO- X (2)Sigma (+) anion ground state. The photoelectron spectra of
   ZnO-, presented here at higher photon energies, extend a previous
   photoelectron study by Fancher et al, to the first two excited neutral
   states, a(3)Pi and A(1)Pi, which have been found to lie 2460 and 4960
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) ground state, respectively. From
   Franck-Condon analyses of the well-resolved vibrational progressions for
   each electronic transition, equilibrium internuclear distances and
   fundamental vibrational frequencies of the MgO and ZnO neutral
   electronic states were determined. Moreover, because the sources
   employed produced vibrationally hot anions, the bond length and
   vibrational frequencies of both the MgO- ground and excited states were
   found from the vibrational hot band transitions.},

Pages = {2943-2946},
Abstract = {The character of low-lying excited states of MgO has been examined using
   cluster models of the MgO crystal. Several different clusters were used;
   in general, the clusters contained a central Mg atom, one or more shells
   of nearest-neighbor Mg and O atoms, and a large number of point charges
   to represent the Madelung potential in the space of the atoms explicitly
   included in the cluster. The excited orbital was occupied in two ways.
   First, an electron was added to a low lying excited level while the Mg2+
   and O2- anion levels were kept fully occupied. In the second way, an
   electron was excited from the oxygen 2p band into a low lying excited
   level. The excited orbitals, for both of these cases are very similar.
   Although the energetics of the excited states depended on the cluster
   model, in particular whether it was Mg or O terminated, the general
   character of the excited orbital remained the same. In all clusters, the
   excited state orbital was diffuse and delocalized. The excited orbital
   has no simple or direct relationship to the 3s orbital of Mg2+. It is
   best described as a `'conduction band'' orbital. It extends up to and

Abstract = {Using a 6-311G{*}{*} basis set with estimation of correlation energy at
   the MP2 level, structural and energetic data for 40 molecular species
   containing magnesium have been calculated. For about half the species
   studied, further energetic data were obtained using Pople's G2 method.
   Enthalpy changes at 298.15 K were obtained for isogyric reactions and
   standard enthalpies of formation were derived from these. Comparison of
   the standard enthalpies of formation with the sparse literature data
   suggests the MP2/6-311G{*}{*} standard enthalpies of formation are
   accurate to +/-15 kJ mol-1 and the corresponding G2 enthalpies accurate
   to +/-10 kJ mol-1. The calculated DELTAH(f)0 {[}MgN, g] revealed a gross
   error in the currently accepted value for this function. It is intended
   that these results will be used to parameterize the semiempirical
   molecular orbital package, MOPAC, for the element magnesium. },

Pages = {479-483},
Abstract = {We demonstrate that the `'systematic'' procedure used by Garcia Cuesta,
   Sanchez de Meras, and Nebot Gil to select a CASSCF active space for MgO
   is flawed by local minima in the optimization. We show that their
   correlation treatment underestimates D(e) by 0.2 eV. In addition, the
   small basis set employed resulted in at least another 0.6 eV
   underestimation of the D(e). Thus their computed D(e) value is in error
   by at least 0.8 eV. Our calculations demonstrate that D(e) (to Mg 1S and
   O 3P) is larger than 2.70 eV and strongly support our previous estimate
   of 2.80 +/- 0.1 eV. Hence, this value is not in error by 1 eV as
   asserted by Nebot Gil and co-workers.},

Abstract = {Ab initio calculations at CASSCF and MRCI PS levels are used to

   adiabatically dissociates to the ground state 1S(g) of magnesium and to
   the excited 1D(g) state of oxygen, as well as other spectroscopic
   parameters.  Emphasis is placed upon the problem of properly selecting
   an adequate active space in CASSCF calculations and upon the
   improvements obtained in MRCI by selecting perturbatively the most
   important contributions to the total wavefunction and evaluating the
   remaining ones only by perturbational methods.  Through a procedure
   based on stabilizing the computed dissociation energy, values of 3.87 eV
   (MRCI PS) and 4.20 eV (CASSCF) are obtained.  These values compare with
   the experimental value of 3.76 +/- 0.13 eV.},

   emphasizes reactions and phase changes occurring within the burning
   metal in addition to those occurring on and above the metal surface.
   Selected recent experimental work showing the importance of these
   internal processes in metal combustion is surveyed. Gas dissolution
   within the burning metal, ensuing phase changes, and their effects on
   combustion are discussed, Metal-gas phase diagrams are used to interpret
   the experimentally observed metal combustion behavior. Some concepts
   aimed at designing improved metal-based high energy density materials
   and controlling metals flammability are briefly addressed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {The current work summarizes recent experimental and theoretical
   investigations of the fundamental processes governing gas-phase
   combustion synthesis of particles. Various experimental methods and
   results are reviewed for the production of non-oxide, single-oxide, and
   mixed-oxide powders. Parameters influencing particle morphology and
   composition including electric field effects are discussed. Nucleation
   and growth models are presented for the different growth regimes,
   including homogenous nucleation, agglomeration, and coalescence. (C)

  title = {{Limits to Mercury's magnesium exosphere from MESSENGER second flyby
	observations}},
  journal = PSS,
  year = {2011},
  volume = {59},
  pages = {1992-2003},
  abstract = {The discovery measurements of Mercury's exospheric magnesium, obtained
	by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging
	(MESSENGER) probe during its second Mercury flyby, are modeled to
	constrain the source and loss processes for this neutral species.
	Fits to a Chamberlain exosphere reveal that at least two source temperatures
	are required to reconcile the distribution of magnesium measured
	far from and near the planet: a hot ejection process at the equivalent
	temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees K, and a competing,
	cooler source at temperatures as low as 400 K. For the energetic
	component, our models indicate that the column abundance that can
	be attributed to sputtering under constant southward interplanetary
	magnetic field conditions is at least a factor of five less than
	the rate dictated by the measurements. Although highly uncertain,
	this result suggests that another energetic process, such as the
	rapid dissociation of exospheric MgO, may be the main source of the
	distant neutral component. If meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts
	eject mainly molecules, the total amount of magnesium at altitudes
	exceeding similar to 100 km is found to be consistent with predictions
	by impact vaporization models for molecule lifetimes of no more than
	two minutes. Though a sharp increase in emission observed near the
	dawn terminator region can be reproduced if a single meteoroid enhanced
	the impact vapor at equatorial dawn, it is much more likely that
	observations in this region, which probe heights increasingly near
	the surface, indicate a reservoir of volatile Mg being acted upon
	by lower-energy source processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

	by the Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer during two solar flare events
	early in the mission (12th December 2008 and 10th January 2009).
	Modelling of the X-ray spectra with an abundance algorithm allows
	quantitative estimates of the MgO/SiO2 and Al2O3/SiO2 ratios to be
	made for the two regions, which are in mainly basaltic areas of the
	lunar nearside. One of these ground tracks includes the Apollo 14
	landing site on the Fra Mauro Formation. Within the 1 sigma errors
	provided, the results are inside the range of basaltic samples from
	the Apollo and Luna collections. The Apollo 14 soil composition is
	in agreement with the results from the January flare at the 1 sigma
	uncertainty level. Discrepancies are observed between our results
	and compositions derived for the same areas by the Lunar Prospector
	gamma-ray spectrometer; some possible reasons for this are discussed.
