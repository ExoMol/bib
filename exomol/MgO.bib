Pages = {926-929},
Abstract = {{Magnesium oxide is an important component of the Earth's mantle and has
   been extensively studied at pressures and temperatures relevant to
   Earth(1). However, much less is known about the behaviour of this oxide
   under conditions likely to occur in extrasolar planets with masses up to
   10 times that of Earth, termed super-Earths, where pressures can exceed
   1,000 GPa (10 million atmospheres). Magnesium oxide is expected to
   change from a rocksalt crystal structure (B1) to a caesium chloride (B2)
   structure at pressures of about 400-600 GPa (refs 2,3). Whereas no
   structural transformation was observed in static compression experiments
   up to 250 GPa (ref. 4), evidence for a solid-solid phase transition was
   obtained in shockwave experiments above 400 GPa and 9,000 K (ref. 5),
   albeit no structural measurements were made. As a result, the properties
   and the structure of MgO under conditions relevant to super-Earths and
   large planets are unknown. Here we present dynamic X-ray diffraction
   measurements of ramp-compressed magnesium oxide. We show that a
   solid-solid phase transition, consistent with a transformation to the B2
   structure, occurs near 600 GPa. On further compression, this structure
   remains stable to 900 GPa. Our results provide an experimental benchmark
   to the equations of state and transition pressure of magnesium oxide,
   and may help constrain mantle viscosity and convection in the deep
   mantle of extrasolar super-Earths.}},

	by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging
	(MESSENGER) probe during its second Mercury flyby, are modeled to
	constrain the source and loss processes for this neutral species.
	Fits to a Chamberlain exosphere reveal that at least two source temperatures
	are required to reconcile the distribution of magnesium measured
	far from and near the planet: a hot ejection process at the equivalent
	temperature of several tens of thousands of degrees K, and a competing,
	cooler source at temperatures as low as 400 K. For the energetic
	component, our models indicate that the column abundance that can
	be attributed to sputtering under constant southward interplanetary
	magnetic field conditions is at least a factor of five less than
	the rate dictated by the measurements. Although highly uncertain,
	this result suggests that another energetic process, such as the
	rapid dissociation of exospheric MgO, may be the main source of the
	distant neutral component. If meteoroid and micrometeoroid impacts
	eject mainly molecules, the total amount of magnesium at altitudes
	exceeding similar to 100 km is found to be consistent with predictions
	by impact vaporization models for molecule lifetimes of no more than
	two minutes. Though a sharp increase in emission observed near the
	dawn terminator region can be reproduced if a single meteoroid enhanced
	the impact vapor at equatorial dawn, it is much more likely that
	observations in this region, which probe heights increasingly near
	the surface, indicate a reservoir of volatile Mg being acted upon
	by lower-energy source processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal =ApJ,
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{598}},
Pages = {785-803},
Abstract = {{Dust grains play a crucial role in the formation and evolution history
   of stars and galaxies in the early universe. We investigate the
   formation of dust grains in the ejecta of Population III supernovae,
   including pair-instability supernovae, which are expected to occur in
   the early universe, applying a theory of non steady state nucleation and
   grain growth. Dust formation calculations are performed for
   core-collapse supernovae with progenitor mass M(pr) ranging from 13 to
   30 M. and for pair-instability supernovae with M(pr) = 170 and 200 M..
   In the calculations, the time evolution of gas temperature in the
   ejecta, which strongly affects the number density and size of newly
   formed grains, is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation,
   taking account of the energy deposition of radioactive elements. Two
   extreme cases are considered for the elemental composition in the
   ejecta, unmixed and uniformly mixed cases within the He core, and
   formation of CO and SiO molecules is assumed to be complete. The results
   of calculations for core-collapse supernovae and pair-instability
   supernovae are summarized as follows: in the unmixed ejecta, a variety
   of grain species condense, reflecting the difference of the elemental
   composition at the formation site in the ejecta; otherwise only oxide
   grains condense in the uniformly mixed ejecta. The average size of newly
   formed grains spans a range of 3 orders of magnitude, depending on the
   grain species and the formation condition, and the maximum radius is
   limited to less than 1 mum, which does not depend on the progenitor
   mass. The size distribution function of each grain species is
   approximately lognormal, except for Mg silicates, MgO, Si, and FeS in
   the unmixed case and Al(2)O(3) in both cases. The size distribution
   function summed up over all grain species is approximated by a power-law
   formula whose index is -3.5 for the larger radius and -2.5 for the
   smaller one; the radius at the crossover point ranges from 0.004 to 0.1
   mum, depending on the model of supernovae. The fraction of mass locked
   into dust grains increases with increasing the progenitor mass: 2\%-5\%
   of the progenitor mass for core-collapse supernovae and 15\%-30\% for
   pair-instability supernovae whose progenitor mass ranges from 140 to 260
   M.. Thus, if very massive stars populated the first generation of stars
   ( Population III stars), a large amount of dust grains would be produced
   in the early universe. We also discuss the dependence of the explosion
   energy and the amount of (56)Ni in the ejecta, as well as the efficiency
   of formation of CO and SiO molecules, on the formation of dust grains in
   the ejecta of supernovae.}},

Pages = {5709-5718},
Abstract = {Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra of MgO- and ZnO- have been
   recorded at several photon energies under varied experimental
   conditions. Peaks in these highly structured spectra have been assigned
   to photodetachment transitions from the MgO- and ZnO- ground state (X
   (2)Sigma (+)) to vibrational progressions in the ground and several low
   lying neutral excited states. In addition, a high-temperature MgO-
   spectrum shows spectral features due to photodetachment from an excited
   electronic state of the MgO- anion, which has been assigned to an
   A(2)Pi: anionic state. From the MgO- spectra, the electron affinity of
   the MgO ground state (X (1)Sigma (+)) is determined to be 1.630 (0.025)
   eV. Four electronic excited states of MgO, a(3)Pi, A(1)Pi, b(3)Sigma
   (+), and B(1)Sigma (+), were found to lie 2510, 3390, 8390; and 20 000
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) neutral ground state, respectively. The
   excited MgO- A(2)Pi anion state was found to lie 4791 cm(-1) above the
   MgO- X (2)Sigma (+) anion ground state. The photoelectron spectra of
   ZnO-, presented here at higher photon energies, extend a previous
   photoelectron study by Fancher et al, to the first two excited neutral
   states, a(3)Pi and A(1)Pi, which have been found to lie 2460 and 4960
   cm(-1) above the X (1)Sigma (+) ground state, respectively. From
   Franck-Condon analyses of the well-resolved vibrational progressions for
   each electronic transition, equilibrium internuclear distances and
   fundamental vibrational frequencies of the MgO and ZnO neutral
   electronic states were determined. Moreover, because the sources
   employed produced vibrationally hot anions, the bond length and
   vibrational frequencies of both the MgO- ground and excited states were
   found from the vibrational hot band transitions.},

   the strongly mixed low-lying X(1) Sigma(+), a(3) Pi and A(1) Pi

   The measurements were made with the Faraday laser magnetic resonance
   (LMR) technique utilizing a CO laser and a CO overtone laser. The new
   observed lines include the A(1) Pi-X(1) Sigma(+) (0-0, 0-1, 1-1, 1-2,

   LMR data provide a basis for performing an extensive deperturbation
   analysis including the spin-orbit, orbit-rotation and Zeeman
   interactions between the rovibronic levels of the X(1) Sigma(+) a(3) Pi

Pages = {3413-3444},
Abstract = {{The Berman (1983) activity-composition model for non-ideal liquid
   solutions in the CaO-MgO-Al2O5-SiO2 (CMAS) system is incorporated into
   equilibrium condensation calculations which are used to explore the
   vapor-solid-liquid stability relations as a function of temperature and
   total pressure (p(tot)) in a gas of solar composition, and as a function
   of temperature and dust/gas ratio at P-tot = 1 X 10(-3) atm in gases
   produced by total vaporization of systems enriched in interstellar dust
   relative to the gas compared to solar abundances. Condensate liquids are
   very non-ideal, suggesting that results of previous attempts to model
   their formation using ideal solution models are highly inaccurate. As is
   the case for the Berman (1983) liquid model itself, results of the
   present calculations are in very good agreement with experimentally
   determined liquid-crystal phase relations except where intermediate
   members of solid solution series, such as melilite and fassaite, are
   predicted to be in equilibrium with liquid, in which cases
   liquid-crystal equilibration temperatures are overestimated by 50 to 100
   K, CMAS liquids are stable in a solar gas at a P-tot least as low as 5 X
   10(-2) atm and perhaps as low as 1 X 10(-2) atm, much lower than
   previous estimates for liquids of pure forsterite composition, due to
   the colligative effects of CaO and Al2O3. CMAS liquids are stable at
   P-tot = 1 X 10(-3) atm in systems with dust/gas enrichment factors at
   least as low as 16 and perhaps as low as 5 relative to solar abundances.
   Results of these calculations suggest that, upon cooling, a solid
   melilite + spinel condensate assemblage, comparable to a Type A
   refractory inclusion, would react with the vapor to produce a liquid
   much richer in MgO and SiO2 than the starting material, at either
   elevated P-tot or enhanced dust/gas ratio, If this partial melt were
   isolated from further reaction with the nebular gas, it would solidify
   into a spinel + melilite + fassaite + anorthite assemblage, similar in
   chemical and mineralogical composition to a Type B refractory inclusion.
   Forsterite coexists stably with CMAS condensate liquids over wide ranges
   of P-tot and dust/gas ratio, extending to the lowest P-tot and dust/gas
   ratio at which liquids are stable. If the compositions of glass
   inclusions inside isolated forsterite crystals in the Murchison CM2
   chondrite have been modified by precipitation of 25 wt\% forsterite as a
   daughter mineral from the liquid precursors of those glasses, the
   inclusions could represent condensate liquids that were in equilibrium
   with forsterite at P-tot = 0.3 atm or at dust/gas enrichment factors of
   similar to 70 at P-tot = 1 X 10(-3) atm.}},

abstract = {The character of low-lying excited states of MgO has been examined using cluster models of the MgO crystal. Several different clusters were used; in general, the clusters contained a central Mg atom, one or more shells of nearest-neighbor Mg and O atoms, and a large number of point charges to represent the Madelung potential in the space of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster. The excited orbital was occupied in two ways. First, an electron was added to a low lying excited level while the Mg2+ and O2- anion levels were kept fully occupied. In the second way, an electron was excited from the oxygen 2p band into a low lying excited level. The excited orbitals, for both of these cases are very similar. Although the energetics of the excited states depended on the cluster model, in particular whether it was Mg or O terminated, the general character of the excited orbital remained the same. In all clusters, the excited state orbital was diffuse and delocalized. The excited orbital has no simple or direct relationship to the 3s orbital of Mg2+. It is best described as a `'conduction band'' orbital. It extends up to and beyond the edge of the atoms explicitly included in the cluster. In our work, we did not find any evidence for localized excitonic states.},

abstract = {A state-averaged multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (SA-MCSCF) procedure based on a density matrix driven MCSCF algorithm is presented and discussed in terms of its use at the MCSCF/configuration interaction (CI) level. The principal aspects of this study are the following: (a) SA-MCSCF optimized orbitals are used to approximate MCSCF orbitals. This aspect of the investigation is relevant to the not infrequent case where MCSCF wave functions are not attainable for higher roots of a given symmetry. (b) The dependence of extended CI wave functions on the choice of SA-MCSCF orbitals is considered and this property is used to provide an internal estimate of the reliability of interstate matrix elements. (c) Transition dipole matrix elements between the llZ+ and Z12+ states in MgO are determined. These results will be used to estimate line strengths for specific vibrational levels of the 2l2+ state. Also presented is a study of the convergence properties of two possible implementations of the SA-MCSCF procedure. It was found that, for a general averaging of several eigenstates, a procedure which includes second derivatives with respect to both orbital and configuration state function parameters is required},
