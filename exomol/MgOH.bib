Abstract = {For X (2)Sigma(+) MgOH, we have calculated the 3D potential energy
   surface (PES) at the MR-SDCI+Q/{[}cc-pCV5Z (Mg), aug-cc-pV5Z (O),
   cc-pV5Z (H)] level and derived the vibrational properties from there
   using the discrete variable representation (DVR) method. The PES minimum
   is at the linear structure; hence, MgOH is a ``linear molecule.{''} The
   3D PES is shallow, and MgOH tends to bend in the region immediately when
   either or both Mg-O and O-H bonds become longer than those of the
   equilibrium structure (r(e)(Mg-O) = 1.7614 \& Aring;, r(e)(O-H) = 0.9453
   \& Aring;, and angle(e)(Mg-O-H) = 180 degrees). The zero-point
   structure, determined as the expectation values over the DVR3D
   wavefunctions, has < r(Mg-O)>(0) = 1.7837 \& Aring; and < r(O-H)>(0) =
   0.9948 \& Aring;, and the deviation angle from linearity
   <rho<overline>>(0) = 26.4 degrees. The harmonic frequencies omega(e) for
   the Mg-O stretching, bending, and O-H stretching modes are 768, 142, and
   4060 cm(-1), respectively, and the corresponding term values nu(1),
   nu(2), and nu(3) are 752, 156, and 3867 cm(-1). All the vibrational
   behaviors, such as quasi-linear features, unusual relationship nu(2) >
   omega(2), a large amplitude bending motion, etc., are elucidated in
   terms of the ab initio electronic wavefunctions and the DVR3D
   vibrational wavefunctions. We have another piece of evidence to support
   our postulation that a linear molecule is observed as being bent.},
