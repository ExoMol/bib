Abstract = {The electronic structure, spectroscopic constants, and transition
   parameters of the diatomic molecule Magnesium monosulfide (MgS) were
   investigated using high-level multi-reference configuration interaction
   calculations with the Davidson correction (MRCI+Q) and a consistent
   basis set for both Mg and S atoms. Potential energy curves and dipole
   moment functions were computed, allowing for accurate predictions of
   rovibrational energy levels. Key transition properties, including
   radiative lifetimes and Franck-Condon factors, were evaluated for
   transitions within the ground electronic state and the first excited
   singlet state. For the ground-state X1E+ rovibrational transitions in
   the infrared region, the line intensity distribution is dominated by zv
   = 0 transitions, with peak intensities reaching 1.83 x 10-20cm/molecule.
   The A1H-X1E+ electronic absorption cross-section reaches a maximum of
   2.258 x 10-17 cm2/molecule in the 2-0 band at T = 50 K and P = 1 bar.
   These results provide benchmark spectroscopic data for the detection of
   MgS in cold molecular clouds and enhance the spectral database required
   for astrophysical modeling and astronomical observations.},
