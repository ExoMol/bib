Abstract = {{This work mainly investigates the transition dipole moments (TDMs) and
   radiative transition probabilities of dipole-allowed transitions between
   the , , , , , , , , and states of N-2. Many of these transition
   properties are previously unknown. For completeness, another 14
   electronic states that correlate to four lowest dissociation limits are
   also calculated. The potential energy curves (PECs) are calculated at
   the valence internally contracted multireference
   configuration-interaction (icMRCI) level of theory, along with the
   Davidson correction, the core-valence (CV) correction and the scalar
   relativistic correction, as well as the basis-set extrapolation. These
   corrections, especially the CV correction, greatly improve the accuracy
   of the PECs, as shown by the excellent agreement of the fitted
   spectroscopic parameters with the available experimental data. In order
   to verify the accuracy of transition properties, we calculate the
   Einstein coefficients of the extensively studied band transition systems
   and compute the radiative lifetimes of states, which are in good
   agreement with the experimental data. Similar accuracy can be assumed
   for the previously undetermined band transition systems. The large
   Einstein coefficients of these band systems can provide guidelines for
   observing such newly predicted band transitions in the appropriate
   spectroscopy experiments.}},
