abstract  ="This article presents experimental results from probing atmospheric air irradiated by a Polonium-210 alpha particle source using both optical emission spectroscopy and continuous wave cavity ring down absorption spectroscopy to study the first positive (B3Πg–A3Σ+u) system of molecular nitrogen. Optical emission spectra were acquired between 11 000 and 17 391 cm−1 (575–900 nm). Long exposure measurements showed definitive emission from the first positive system{,} atomic nitrogen{,} atomic oxygen{,} and atomic argon. A non-Boltzmann emission model was constructed and fit to the data to infer relative vibrational state populations of N2(B3Πg). In pursuit of more quantitative characterization of the air ionization{,} cavity ring down absorption measurements were performed between 12 800 and 13 070 cm−1 (765–781 nm) using an external cavity diode laser targeting detection and quantification of electronically excited molecular nitrogen N2(A3Σ+u). The null result in this measurement provides experimental evidence that in atmospheric pressure air{,} the presence of N2(A3Σ+u) generated by alpha particle radiation is below the estimated 0.4 ppb detection limit of the experiment."}

Title = {{Photoselective isotope fractionation dynamics of N$_2$ with cosmo and
   atmospheric chemistry perspectives}},
Journal = PNAS,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {122},
Abstract = {Stable isotope ratio measurements provide valuable insights into a broad
   range of natural processes, from planetary atmospheres and climate to
   interstellar chemistry. Nitrogen, which has two stable isotopes,
   exhibits varying isotope ratios across the solar system. To model these
   observations, the isotope fraction as a function of energy is essential.
   At the Advanced Light Source (ALS), we measured the photodissociation of
   molecular nitrogen (N2) with vacuum UV photons where a single photon is
   sufficiently energetic to dissociate the strong bond. The nitrogen atoms
   produced are scavenged with H2 to form ammonia, whose isotopic makeup is
   determined. Blending the experiments with dynamical computations that
   include the shielding of light, we examine the isotopic composition and
   electronic atomic states produced. The measured photodissociation of N2
   at a natural isotopic composition with a frequency broad light beam
   exceptionally strongly favors the formation of the heavier nitrogen
   isotope, 15N. Computations concur and suggest that the maximum in the
   quantum yield reflects significant variations in the specific electronic
   quantum states of the product N atoms that have quite different
   reactivities. Our quantum computations show that at similar energies,
   photodissociation of 14N14N and 15N14N can lead to different product
   channels. The computed dynamics include extensive state-selective
   spin-orbit and nonadiabatic couplings affecting the light absorption and
   dissociation pathways that proceed via the triplet manifold of states.
   Our results are relevant for future exploration missions, both in situ
   and sample-return and for other molecules such as O2 and CO.},

   of N2 (C{''}<SUP>5</SUP>Πu) and
   N2 (1 <SUP>7</SUP>Σu plus ) Interacting States}},
Journal = {ACS Omega},
Year = {2025},
Abstract = {This work presents a perturbative calculation methodology for evaluating
   the energy shifts and broadening of vibrational energy levels, caused by
   interactions between bound and unbound dissociative electronic states.
   The method is validated against previously semiclassical analyzed cases,
   demonstrating remarkable consistency. We successfully applied this
   approach to the N2 molecule, which exhibits a strong spin-orbit
   interaction between the bound C `' 5 Pi u and the repulsive 1 7 Sigma u
   + electronic states, around 36 cm-1. This interaction constitutes an
   major pathway for N(2D) production, important in both excitation and
   quenching in plasma afterglows. As a result, the maximum absolute shift
   of 0.15 cm-1 was found for the C `' 5 Pi u (v = 7) and maximum
   broadening of 0.45 cm-1 was calculated for v = 8, demonstrating
   significant perturbation of the C `' 5 Pi u by the 1 7 Sigma u + state.
   The results obtained were compared with direct calculations of the
   predissociation rates of the C `' 5 Pi u bound state, showing very good
   agreement.},

    abstract = { The presented comparative study is focused on diatomic nitrogen which comprises on average 78\% main part of the atmosphere. Spectroscopic properties of nitrogen include individual states and transitions among them and play an important role in the Earth’s protection against highly energetic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation. The comparative study focuses on the band of transitions between the A3-B3 states. Its uniqueness lies in that it covers a gap in the scientific literature regarding spectral intensity comparisons for the entire band of currently known transitions between A3-B3 states of diatomic nitrogen. In the introduction, the work deals with the content of spectroscopic data on the A3-B3 band in some publicly available world databases. It showed that the initial collections of spectroscopic data on this band were not a common standard of scientific databases. Due to the complexity of calculating spectral intensities, it was necessary to draw input data on this band from multiple sources. For the purposes of the calculation, the open-source spectra calculation program Lino da Silva’s SPARK is used. The calculation procedure of which is documented by the given relationships. The compared spectra form 3×105 intensities. For the needs of comparison of the spectra, the author of the study supplemented the existing program with a program sequence in the MATLAB environment. It allowed working with an adaptive grid and creating a histogram. The resulting comparison showed that in the places of the spectra with the greatest intensity, their difference was an average of 27\%. Overall from the histogram, only 10\% of the mutual deviations ranged between 60 to 80\%. In conclusion, some possible causes of errors and their sizes are discussed. }

    abstract = "{Multi-state electronic dynamics at higher excitation energies is needed for the understanding of a variety of energy rich situations, including chemistry under extreme conditions, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) induced astrochemistry, and attochemistry. It calls for an understanding of three stages, energy acquisition, dynamical propagation, and disposal. It is typically not possible to identify a basis of uncoupled quantum states that is sufficient for the three stages. The handicap is the large number of coupled quantum states that is needed to describe the system. Progress in quantum chemistry provides the necessary background to the energetics and the coupling. Progress in quantum dynamics takes this as input for the propagation in time. Right now, it seems that we have come of age with potential detailed applications. We here report a demonstration to a coupled electron-nuclear quantum dynamics through a maze of 47 electronic states and with attention to the order in perturbation theory that is indicated using propensity rules for couplings. Close agreement with experimental results for the VUV photodissociation of 14N2 and its isotopomer 14N15N is achieved. We pay special attention to the coupling between two dissociative continua and an optically accessible bound domain. The computations reproduce and interpret the non-monotonic branching between the two exit channels producing N(2D) and N(2P) atoms as a function of excitation energy and its variation with the mass.}",

  abstract={A new spin-forbidden quintet-triplet C′′5Πu → B3Πg transition is predicted 
  in the N2 molecule on the ground of MRCI calculations with account of spin-obit coupling 
  (SOC) by perturbation theory. The mechanism of its probability borrowing is quite similar 
  to the recently calculated spin-forbidden electric dipole A′5Σg+ → A3Σu+ transition in the
  emission spectrum of the N2 molecule. Neither of the two predicted emission systems have yet 
  been observed in electric discharges but the calculated intensity provides a good chance for 
  their detection. Both transitions, C′′–B and A′–A, borrow intensity from the First Positive 
  System (B3Πg → A3Σu+) and from the Herman Infrared Band (C′′5Πu → A′5Σg+). The latter spin-allowed 
  quintet-quintet transition provides strong depletion of the upper C′′ state; nevertheless, 
  the energy pooling collisions of the triplet N2 molecule and atomic recombination produce a 
  permanent pumping of the C′′5Πu states leaving a prominent emission with a detectable quantum 
  yield. The proposed C′′ → B vibronic transitions have Einstein A coefficients in the order of 
  105–104 s −1, showing a considerable number of strong vibronic bands. As a consequence, the 
  radiative lifetimes of the highest spin sublevel of the C′′5Πu,1 irregular state are about 10−6 s.}

Abstract = {Molecular nitrogen (N-2) is the most abundant molecule in the Earth's
   atmosphere and in the less chemically-processed atmosphere of Titan.
   Until recently N-2 had never been detected in interstellar space. We
   report on the first detection of interstellar N-2 in the interstellar
   medium (ISM) toward the star HD 124314 with an observed fractional
   abundance of N-2/H-2 = 3.3 x 10(-7). This N-2 abundance is almost two
   orders of magnitude larger than expected from models of interstellar
   nitrogen chemistry for diffuse clouds and is also less than expected
   from dark cloud chemistry. Preliminary analysis of high signal to noise
   data on 20 Aql yields x(N-2) <= 4.7 x 10(-8), which is surprisingly low
   given that 20 Aql has a higher CN abundance. There appears to be an
   anticorrelation between N-2 and CN: Is this anti-correlation caused by
   differences in the predictions of diffuse and dark cloud chemistry?
   Further observations of interstellar N-2 are required to fully
   understand the implications for interstellar nitrogen chemistry.}}

abstract = {The 14N/15N ratio for N2 in the atmosphere of Titan was recently measured to be a factor of 2 higher than the corresponding ratio for HCN. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model with transport, we incorporate new isotopic photoabsorption and photodissociation cross sections of N2, computed quantum-mechanically, and show that the difference in the ratio of 14N/15N between N2 and HCN can be explained primarily by the photolytic fractionation of 14N14N and 14N 15N. The [HC14N]/[HC15N] ratio produced by N2 photolysis alone is 23. This value, together with the observed ratio, constrains the flux of atomic nitrogen input from the top of the atmosphere to be in the range (1-2) × 109 atoms cm-2 s-1.}
