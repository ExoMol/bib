  abstract={A new spin-forbidden quintet-triplet C′′5Πu → B3Πg transition is predicted 
  in the N2 molecule on the ground of MRCI calculations with account of spin-obit coupling 
  (SOC) by perturbation theory. The mechanism of its probability borrowing is quite similar 
  to the recently calculated spin-forbidden electric dipole A′5Σg+ → A3Σu+ transition in the
  emission spectrum of the N2 molecule. Neither of the two predicted emission systems have yet 
  been observed in electric discharges but the calculated intensity provides a good chance for 
  their detection. Both transitions, C′′–B and A′–A, borrow intensity from the First Positive 
  System (B3Πg → A3Σu+) and from the Herman Infrared Band (C′′5Πu → A′5Σg+). The latter spin-allowed 
  quintet-quintet transition provides strong depletion of the upper C′′ state; nevertheless, 
  the energy pooling collisions of the triplet N2 molecule and atomic recombination produce a 
  permanent pumping of the C′′5Πu states leaving a prominent emission with a detectable quantum 
  yield. The proposed C′′ → B vibronic transitions have Einstein A coefficients in the order of 
  105–104 s −1, showing a considerable number of strong vibronic bands. As a consequence, the 
  radiative lifetimes of the highest spin sublevel of the C′′5Πu,1 irregular state are about 10−6 s.}
