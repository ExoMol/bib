    abstract = { The presented comparative study is focused on diatomic nitrogen which comprises on average 78\% main part of the atmosphere. Spectroscopic properties of nitrogen include individual states and transitions among them and play an important role in the Earth’s protection against highly energetic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation. The comparative study focuses on the band of transitions between the A3-B3 states. Its uniqueness lies in that it covers a gap in the scientific literature regarding spectral intensity comparisons for the entire band of currently known transitions between A3-B3 states of diatomic nitrogen. In the introduction, the work deals with the content of spectroscopic data on the A3-B3 band in some publicly available world databases. It showed that the initial collections of spectroscopic data on this band were not a common standard of scientific databases. Due to the complexity of calculating spectral intensities, it was necessary to draw input data on this band from multiple sources. For the purposes of the calculation, the open-source spectra calculation program Lino da Silva’s SPARK is used. The calculation procedure of which is documented by the given relationships. The compared spectra form 3×105 intensities. For the needs of comparison of the spectra, the author of the study supplemented the existing program with a program sequence in the MATLAB environment. It allowed working with an adaptive grid and creating a histogram. The resulting comparison showed that in the places of the spectra with the greatest intensity, their difference was an average of 27\%. Overall from the histogram, only 10\% of the mutual deviations ranged between 60 to 80\%. In conclusion, some possible causes of errors and their sizes are discussed. }

The line list extends the number of vibrational states of the B3Πg up to v = 29 and a maximum rotational state of J = 150 for simulation temperatures up to 7000 K. New electronic-vibrational transition moments were calculated using refined potential energy curves and a transition dipole moment with the DUO software. Comparisons to experimental data and the SPECAIR software have been used to validate the new line list. The results are available in ASCII ExoMol .state and .trans files and as a PGOPHER input file for use in spectral analysis.}

    abstract = "{Multi-state electronic dynamics at higher excitation energies is needed for the understanding of a variety of energy rich situations, including chemistry under extreme conditions, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) induced astrochemistry, and attochemistry. It calls for an understanding of three stages, energy acquisition, dynamical propagation, and disposal. It is typically not possible to identify a basis of uncoupled quantum states that is sufficient for the three stages. The handicap is the large number of coupled quantum states that is needed to describe the system. Progress in quantum chemistry provides the necessary background to the energetics and the coupling. Progress in quantum dynamics takes this as input for the propagation in time. Right now, it seems that we have come of age with potential detailed applications. We here report a demonstration to a coupled electron-nuclear quantum dynamics through a maze of 47 electronic states and with attention to the order in perturbation theory that is indicated using propensity rules for couplings. Close agreement with experimental results for the VUV photodissociation of 14N2 and its isotopomer 14N15N is achieved. We pay special attention to the coupling between two dissociative continua and an optically accessible bound domain. The computations reproduce and interpret the non-monotonic branching between the two exit channels producing N(2D) and N(2P) atoms as a function of excitation energy and its variation with the mass.}",

  abstract={A new spin-forbidden quintet-triplet C′′5Πu → B3Πg transition is predicted 
  in the N2 molecule on the ground of MRCI calculations with account of spin-obit coupling 
  (SOC) by perturbation theory. The mechanism of its probability borrowing is quite similar 
  to the recently calculated spin-forbidden electric dipole A′5Σg+ → A3Σu+ transition in the
  emission spectrum of the N2 molecule. Neither of the two predicted emission systems have yet 
  been observed in electric discharges but the calculated intensity provides a good chance for 
  their detection. Both transitions, C′′–B and A′–A, borrow intensity from the First Positive 
  System (B3Πg → A3Σu+) and from the Herman Infrared Band (C′′5Πu → A′5Σg+). The latter spin-allowed 
  quintet-quintet transition provides strong depletion of the upper C′′ state; nevertheless, 
  the energy pooling collisions of the triplet N2 molecule and atomic recombination produce a 
  permanent pumping of the C′′5Πu states leaving a prominent emission with a detectable quantum 
  yield. The proposed C′′ → B vibronic transitions have Einstein A coefficients in the order of 
  105–104 s −1, showing a considerable number of strong vibronic bands. As a consequence, the 
  radiative lifetimes of the highest spin sublevel of the C′′5Πu,1 irregular state are about 10−6 s.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The 14N/15N ratio for N2 in the atmosphere of Titan was recently measured to be a factor of 2 higher than the corresponding ratio for HCN. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model with transport, we incorporate new isotopic photoabsorption and photodissociation cross sections of N2, computed quantum-mechanically, and show that the difference in the ratio of 14N/15N between N2 and HCN can be explained primarily by the photolytic fractionation of 14N14N and 14N 15N. The [HC14N]/[HC15N] ratio produced by N2 photolysis alone is 23. This value, together with the observed ratio, constrains the flux of atomic nitrogen input from the top of the atmosphere to be in the range (1-2) × 109 atoms cm-2 s-1.}
