Title = {{Accurate equilibrium structures of linear triatomic molecules from a
   combined theoretical-experimental method: The protonated nitrogen
   molecule, HN2+}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {383},
Abstract = {This article examines several strategies which can be used to derive
   molecular equilibrium structure from experimental data and extends our
   previously suggested method to HN2+ . Full-dimensional rovibrational
   calculations are carried out for eight isotopologues of HN2+ using two
   ab initio potential energy representations. Rovibrational energies
   computed for rotational angular momenta J as high as 15 in both parities
   are used to derive theoretical vibration-rotation corrections to
   ground-state rotation constants B-0. These results are combined with the
   available experimentally derived B-0 values to determine the r(0),
   r(alpha), and r(e) structures of the ion. Higher-order corrections
   beyond the vibration-rotation alpha \& nbsp;constants are found to be
   essential for the structure determination. Our analysis is supported by
   graphical representations, illustrating the anticorrelation of the
   structural parameters. The r(0) structure is rationalized in terms of a
   structure projected onto the principal a axis and examined for the
   isoelectronic series of linear triatomic molecules HCO+, HCN, HNHN2+,
   HNC, and HOC+.},

   THz},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {314},
Pages = {19-25},
Abstract = {Terahertz absorption spectroscopy was employed to extend the
   measurements on the pure rotational transitions of N2H+, N2D+ and their
   N-15-containing isotopologues in the ground state and first excited
   vibrational states for the three fundamental vibrational modes. In
   total, 91 new pure rotational transitions were observed in the range of
   0.7-2.7 THz. The observed transition frequencies were fit to
   experimental accuracy, and the improved molecular parameters were
   obtained. The new measurements and predictions reported here will
   support the analysis of high-resolution astronomical observations made
   with facilities such as SOFIA and ALMA where laboratory rest frequencies
   with uncertainties of 1 MHz or smaller are required for proper analysis
   of velocity resolved astrophysical components.},

Title = {{Ion-molecule reactions involving HCO+ and N2H+: Isotopologue equilibria
   from new theoretical calculations and consequences for interstellar
   isotope fractionation}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {566},
Abstract = {Aims. We revisit with new augmented accuracy the theoretical dynamics of
   basic isotope exchange reactions involved in the C-12/C-13, O-16/O-18,
   and N-14/N-15 balance because these reactions have already been studied
   experimentally in great detail.
   Methods. Electronic structure methods were employed to explore potential
   energy surfaces, full-dimensional rovibrational calculations to compute
   rovibrational energy levels that are numerically exact, and chemical
   network models to estimate the abundance ratios under interstellar
   conditions.
   Results. New exothermicities, derived for HCO+ reacting with CO, provide
   rate coefficients markedly different from previous theoretical values in
   particular at low temperatures, resulting in new abundance ratios
   relevant for carbon chemistry networks. In concrete terms, we obtain a
   reduction in the abundance of (HCO+)-C-12-O-18 and an increase in the
   abundance of (HCO+)-C-13-O-16 and (DCO+)-C-13-O-16. In all studied
   cases, the reaction of the ion with a neutral polarizable molecule
   proceeds through the intermediate proton-bound complex found to be very
   stable. For the complexes OCH+ center dot center dot center dot CO, OCH+
   center dot center dot center dot OC, COHOC+, N-2, center dot center dot
   center dot HCO+, N2H+ center dot center dot center dot OC, and N2LIN2+,
   we also calculated vibrational frequencies and dissociation energies.
   Conclusions. The linear proton-bound complexes possess sizeable dipole
   moments, which may facilitate their detection.},

Title = {PRECISE THz MEASUREMENTS OF HCO+, N2H+, AND CF+ FOR ASTROPHYSICAL
   OBSERVATIONS},
Journal =ApJSS,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {203},
Abstract = {Ground-state rotational spectra of HCO+, N2H+, and CF+ (both C-12- and
   C-13- containing isotopologues) have been recorded in the 1.0-1.6 THz
   frequency range. Present measurements allowed us to improve the
   spectroscopic parameters, which in turn enabled the prediction of
   rotational transitions up to 2.0-2.5 THz with good accuracy. We
   therefore consider the present results to be of great value in view of
   the extended spectral coverage made available by the Herschel Space
   Observatory, Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, and the
   Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Furthermore, we re- investigated the
   ground-state rotational spectrum of N2H+ in the 93-750 GHz frequency
   range, thus addressing the open issue of the frequency of the J = 1 <- 0
   transition as well as resolving the hyperfine structure of the J = 1 <-
   J transitions with J = 1, 2, and 3 for the first time.},

Title = {Comparison of one-particle basis set extrapolation to explicitly
   correlated methods for the calculation of accurate quartic force fields,
   vibrational frequencies, and spectroscopic constants: Application to
   H2O, N2H+, NO2+, and C2H2},
Journal =JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Abstract = {One-particle basis set extrapolation is compared with one of the new R12
   methods for computing highly accurate quartic force fields (QFFs) and
   spectroscopic data, including molecular structures, rotational
   constants, and vibrational frequencies for the H2O, N2H+, NO2+, and C2H2
   molecules. In general, agreement between the spectroscopic data computed
   from the best R12 and basis set extrapolation methods is very good with
   the exception of a few parameters for N2H+ where it is concluded that
   basis set extrapolation is still preferred. The differences for H2O and
   NO2+ are small and it is concluded that the QFFs from both approaches
   are more or less equivalent in accuracy. For C2H2, however, a known
   one-particle basis set deficiency for C-C multiple bonds significantly
   degrades the quality of results obtained from basis set extrapolation
   and in this case the R12 approach is clearly preferred over one-particle
   basis set extrapolation. The R12 approach used in the present study was
   modified in order to obtain high precision electronic energies, which
   are needed when computing a QFF. We also investigated including
   core-correlation explicitly in the R12 calculations, but conclude that
   current approaches are lacking. Hence core-correlation is computed as a
   correction using conventional methods. Considering the results for all
   four molecules, it is concluded that R12 methods will soon replace basis
   set extrapolation approaches for high accuracy electronic structure
   applications such as computing QFFs and spectroscopic data for
   comparison to high-resolution laboratory or astronomical observations,
   provided one uses a robust R12 method as we have done here. The specific
   R12 method used in the present study, CCSD(T)(R12), incorporated a
   reformulation of one intermediate matrix in order to attain machine
   precision in the electronic energies. Final QFFs for N2H+ and NO2+ were
   computed, including basis set extrapolation, core-correlation, scalar
   relativity, and higher-order correlation and then used to compute highly
   accurate spectroscopic data for all isotopologues. Agreement with
   high-resolution experiment for (N2H+)-N-14 and (N2D+)-N-14 was
   excellent, but for (NO2+)-N-14-O-16 agreement for the two stretching
   fundamentals is outside the expected residual uncertainty in the
   theoretical values, and it is concluded that there is an error in the
   experimental quantities. It is hoped that the highly accurate
   spectroscopic data presented for the minor isotopologues of N2H+ and
   NO2+ will be useful in the interpretation of future laboratory or
   astronomical observations. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {The adiabatic three-dimensional potential energy surface and the
   corresponding dipole moment surface describing the ground electronic
   state of HN2+ ((X) over tilde (1)Sigma(+)) are calculated at different
   levels of ab initio theory. The calculations cover the entire bound part
   of the potential up to its lowest dissociation channel including the
   isomerization barrier. Energies of all bound vibrational and low-lying
   ro-vibrational levels are determined in a fully variational procedure
   using the Suttcliffe-Tennyson Hamiltonian for triatomic molecules. They
   are in close agreement with the available experimental numbers. From the
   dipole moment function effective dipoles and transition moments are
   obtained for all the calculated vibrational and ro-vibrational states.
   Statistical tools such as the density of states or the nearest-neighbor
   level spacing distribution (NNSD) are applied to describe and analyse
   general patterns and characteristics of the energy and dipole results
   calculated for the massively large number of states of the strongly

Abstract = {The pure rotational transitions of HN2+ and DN2+ in the first excited

   MHz for HN2+ and B-e = 38708.38 (58) MHz for DN2+, have been determined
   by correcting for the higher-order vibration-rotation interaction
   effects, y(ij), obtained by an infrared investigation. The equilibrium
   bond lengths are derived from these equilibrium rotational constants:
