Abstract = {The molecular line list of NO2 + is of great atmospheric significance,
   especially for related spectral characterization and radiative transfer
   calculation. Using robust first-principles methods, we presented the
   first comprehensive line list of ground-state NO2 +. Analytical
   potential energy surface and dipole moment surface were constructed
   based on 8991 ab initio points from coupled-cluster calculations, in
   which the core-valence electron correlation and scalar relativistic
   effects were considered in the calculations of potential energy. The
   variational nuclear motion program TROVE was used to obtain the
   ro-vibrational energy levels, wave function, and Einstein A
   coefficients. The line list contains almost 25.1 million transitions
   between 736 thousand energy levels with rotational excitation up to 200,
   which covers the wavenumber range of 0-9000 cm-1 and is suitable for
   temperatures up to 3000 K.},
