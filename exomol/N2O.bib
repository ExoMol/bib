abstract = {We report the second generation of Ames N2O IR line lists, ABG-IMRHT for room-temperature and Ames-2000K for high temperature applications. The ABG-IMRHT line list utilized a new potential energy surface (PES), B1b, refined from a refit of Schröder’s Comp I PES [10.1515/zpch-2015-0622] with σrms = 0.006 cm-1 for all reliable 14N216O levels in HITRAN2020 [10.1016/j.jqsrt.2021.107949], and a new dipole moment surface (DMS) G10K carrying fitting σrms = 6.1 × 10-7 au up to 10,000 cm-1. Compared to the previous Ames-296K line list, the PES and DMS upgrades have significantly reduced the line position deviations (δ) and relative intensity deviations (δ%), and maintained consistent accuracy across isotopologues. The line positions of the new ABG (Ames B1b + G10K) line lists including 12 stable N2O isotopolouges are enhanced by ∼100,000 global EH model based 14N216O levels from NOSL-296, and empirical levels determined from IAO, MARVEL, RITZ, HITRAN, and JPL(Toth) datasets, hence denoted ABG-IMRHT. Simple 0th-2nd order corrections are determined for ENOSL of about 20 vibrational states above 10,000 cm-1, based on ENOSL , ERITZ, and EMARVEL comparison. Uncertainty estimates are given for upper and lower state energies (E' and E"), line positions, and IR intensities. The Ames-2000K line list contains 3.4 billion IR transitions covering the 0 – 15,000 cm-1 range with Jmax=210 and E'/E"=0.125 Hartree (above the PES minimum) for 14N216O. It combines strengths of three components: “Ames-1” computed using Ames-1 PES and a weighted DMS “G2d” for 12 isotopologues, “B1b” for 14N216O computed using B1b PES and G10K DMS with E' < 16,000 cm-1; and ABG-IMRHT line list. Comparison against HITEMP [10.1016/j.jqsrt.2019.04.040] and UCL TYM (ExoMol) [10.1093/mnras/stae2201] line lists are presented. This study represents a higher level of experiment-model-theory synergy, and a “block” approach for hot IR line list construction. The line lists and related datafiles are available online [10.5281/zenodo.14174306].}

   biogenic production using a space-based mid-infrared nulling
   interferometric observatory, such as the Large Interferometer For

   from chemical kinetics models that simulate the atmospheric response of
   varied levels of biogenic production of N2O, CH3Cl, and CH3Br in O2-rich
   terrestrial planet atmospheres to produce forward models for our LIFEsim
   observation simulator software. In addition, we demonstrate the
   connection to retrievals for selected cases. We use the results to
   derive observation times needed for the detection of these scenarios and
   apply them to define science requirements for the mission. Our analysis
   shows that in order to detect relevant abundances with a mission like
   LIFE in its current baseline setup, we require: (i) only a few days of
   observation time for certain very nearby ``golden target{''} scenarios,
   which also motivate future studies of ``spectral-temporal{''}
   observations (ii) similar to 10 days in certain standard scenarios such
   as temperate, terrestrial planets around M star hosts at 5 pc, (iii)
   similar to 50-100 days in the most challenging but still feasible cases,
   such as an Earth twin at 5 pc. A few cases with very low fluxes around
   specific host stars are not detectable. In summary, the abundances of
   these capstone biosignatures are detectable at plausible biological
   production fluxes for most cases examined and for a significant number
   of potential targets.},

   Integrated Biogeochemical, Photochemical, and Spectral Modeling Approach}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {937},
Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O)-a product of microbial nitrogen metabolism-is a
   compelling exoplanet biosignature gas with distinctive spectral features
   in the near- and mid-infrared, and only minor abiotic sources on Earth.
   Previous investigations of N2O as a biosignature have examined scenarios
   using Earthlike N2O mixing ratios or surface fluxes, or those inferred
   from Earth's geologic record. However, biological fluxes of N2O could be
   substantially higher, due to a lack of metal catalysts or if the last
   step of the denitrification metabolism that yields N-2 from N2O had
   never evolved. Here, we use a global biogeochemical model coupled with
   photochemical and spectral models to systematically quantify the limits
   of plausible N2O abundances and spectral detectability for Earth analogs
   orbiting main-sequence (FGKM) stars. We examine N2O buildup over a range
   of oxygen conditions (1\%-100\% present atmospheric level) and N2O
   fluxes (0.01-100 teramole per year; Tmol = 10(12) mole) that are
   compatible with Earth's history. We find that N2O fluxes of 10 {[}100]
   Tmol yr(-1) would lead to maximum N2O abundances of similar to 5 {[}50]
   ppm for Earth-Sun analogs, 90 {[}1600] ppm for Earths around late K
   dwarfs, and 30 {[}300] ppm for an Earthlike TRAPPIST-1e. We simulate
   emission and transmission spectra for intermediate and maximum N2O
   concentrations that are relevant to current and future space-based
   telescopes. We calculate the detectability of N2O spectral features for
   high-flux scenarios for TRAPPIST-1e with JWST. We review potential false
   positives, including chemodenitrification and abiotic production via
   stellar activity, and identify key spectral and contextual discriminants
   to confirm or refute the biogenicity of the observed N2O.},

   doubling features for l = 2 or higher states. The existence of l-type
   doubling was investigated by high-resolution and ultra-sensitive cavity
   ring-down spectroscopy coupled with an external-cavity quantum cascade
   laser. We determined several new spectroscopic parameters such as l-type
   doubling constants, Coriolis constants, band centres, rotational
   constants and centrifugal distortion constants for l = 2 state of
   beta-site N2O isotopomer by probing the rotationally resolved spectral
   lines with higher J values in the P-branch. Subsequently, the pressure
   broadening effect on the l-doublets and the corresponding broadening
   coefficients for both e and f sub-states in Delta state of beta-site N2O
   were explored. Our high-resolution spectroscopic measurements will be
   useful for better fundamental understanding of linear polyatomic

   These experiments differ from previous LIDB experiments due to the 100

Abstract = {In spite of being a greenhouse gas with a large global warming
   potential, the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide in the near infrared
   is insufficiently characterized. In the present work, the spectral
   region near 1.74 mu m (5696-5910 cm(-1)) is investigated by high
   sensitivity cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). The noise level of the
   CRDS spectra corresponds to a typical minimum detectable absorption,
   alpha(min), below 10(-10) cm(-1). 3326 transitions are measured and
   rovibrationally assigned to 50 bands of five nitrous oxide isotopologues
   ((N2O)-N-14-O-16, (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16, (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16,
   (N2O)-N-14-O-18 and (N2O)-N-14-O-17) in natural isotopic abundance. The
   assigned weakest lines have an intensity below 10(-28)cm/molecule. For
   comparison, only three (N2O)-N-14-O-16 bands are included in the HITRAN
   database in the region, with a 2 x 10(-25)cm/molecule intensity cut off.
   The rovibrational assignments were performed by comparison with
   predictions performed for each isotopologue in the frame of the
   effective operator approach. The overall quality of the predictions is
   satisfactory for line positions. Deviations larger than 0.1 cm(-1) are
   nevertheless noted for (N2O)-N-14-O-16 and (N2O)-N-14-O-18.
   The spectroscopic parameters of the upper level of the observed bands
   were derived from the standard band-by-band fit of the measured line
   positions. A significant number of bands were found to be perturbed by
   local rovibrational perturbations and in some cases, extra lines due to
   an intensity transfer could be assigned. The interaction mechanisms and
   the perturbers were univocally identified on the basis of the effective
   Hamiltonian model. In particular, interpolyad couplings were evidenced
   indicating that the polyad version of the effective Hamiltonian has to
   be extended to include Coriolis and interpolyad anharmonic interactions.
   No satisfactory modeling of the N2O line intensities is yet available in
   the region. The CRDS intensity values derived in this work provide a
   solid set of measurements for future semi-empirical intensity modeling

abstract = {Abstract In the coming years and decades, advanced space- and ground-based
observatories will allow an unprecedented opportunity to probe the atmospheres
and surfaces of potentially habitable exoplanets for signatures of life. Life
on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties,
has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality
of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the
present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the
search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient
Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have
compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet
biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally
survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature
but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures.
We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel
methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and
assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived
biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since
the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose
new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but
to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly
disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward. Key Words:
Exoplanets—Biosignatures—Habitability markers—Photosynthesis—Planetary
surfaces—Atmospheres—Spectroscopy—Cryptic biospheres—False positives.},

Abstract = {We review the field of exoplanetary biosignatures with a main focus upon
   atmospheric gas phase species. Due to the paucity of data in Earth-like
   planetary atmospheres a common approach is to extrapolate knowledge from
   the Solar System and Early Earth to Earth-like exoplanets. We therefore
   review the main processes (e.g. atmospheric photochemistry and
   transport) affecting the most commonly-considered species (e.g. O-2,
   O-3, N2O, CH4 etc.) in the context of the modern Earth, Early Earth, the
   Solar System and Earth-like exoplanets. We consider thereby known
   abiotic sources for these spqcies in the Solar System and beyond. We
   also discuss detectability issues related to atmospheric biosignature
   spectra such as band strength and uniqueness. Finally, we summarize
   current space agency roadmaps related to biosignature science in an
   exoplanet context.},

Title = {Infrared radiative transfer in atmospheres of Earth-like planets around
   F, G, K, and M stars I. Clear-sky thermal emission spectra and weighting
   functions},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {549},
Abstract = {Context. The atmosphere of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting
   different types of stars is influenced by the spectral dependence of the
   incoming stellar radiation. The changes in structure and composition
   affect atmospheric radiation, hence the spectral appearance of these
   exoplanets.
   Aims. We provide a thorough investigation of infrared radiative transfer
   in cloud-free exoplanets atmospheres by not only analyzing the planetary
   spectral appearance but also discussing the radiative processes behind
   the spectral features in detail and identifying the regions in the
   atmosphere that contribute most at a given wavelength.
   Methods. Using cloud-free scenarios provided by a one-dimensional
   radiative-convective steady-state atmospheric model, we computed
   high-resolution infrared transmission and emission spectra, as well as
   weighting functions for exoplanets located within the habitable zone of
   F, G, K, and M stars by means of a line-by-line molecular absorption
   model and a Schwarzschild solver for the radiative transfer. The
   monochromatic spectra were convolved with appropriate spectral response
   functions to study the effects of finite instrument resolution.
   Results. Spectra of the exoplanets of F, G, K, and M stars were analyzed
   in the 4.5 mu m N2O band, the 4.3 mu m and 15 mu m CO2 bands, the 7.7 mu
   m CH4 band, the 6.3 mu m H2O band, and the 9.6 mu m O-3 band.
   Differences in the state of the atmosphere of the exoplanets clearly
   show up in the thermal infrared spectra; absorption signatures known
   from Earth can be transformed to emission features (and vice versa).
   Weighting functions show that radiation in the absorption bands of the
   uniformly mixed gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) and (to some extent) ozone comes
   from the stratosphere and upper troposphere, and also indicate that
   changes in the atmospheres can shift sources of thermal radiation to
   lower or higher altitudes. Molecular absorption and/or emission features
   can be identified in the high-resolution spectra of all planets and in
   most reduced resolution spectra.
   Conclusions. Insight into radiative transfer processes is essential for
   analyzing exoplanet spectral observations; for instance, understanding
   the impact of the temperature profile (nb. non-existence of an
   inversion) on the CO2 bands facilitates their interpretation and can
   help avoid false positive or negative estimates of O-3. The detailed
   analysis of the radiation source and sink regions could even help give
   an indication about the feasibility of identifying molecular signatures
   in cloud-covered planets, i.e. radiation mainly coming from the upper
   atmosphere is less likely to be hidden by clouds. Infrared radiative
   transfer and biomarker detectability in cloud-covered exoplanets will be
   presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {Stratospheric ozone is depleted by many different chemicals; most prominently, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) responsible for causing the Antarctic ozone hole. Nitrous oxide is also an ozone-depleting substance that has natural sources in addition to anthropogenic ones. Moreover, unlike CFCs, its use and emission are not regulated by the Montreal Protocol, which has helped to reverse the rate of growth of the ozone hole. Surprisingly, Ravishankara et al. (p. 123, published online 27 August; see the Perspective by Wuebbles) now show that nitrous oxide is the single greatest ozone-depleting substance that, if its emissions are not controlled, is expected to remain the dominant ozone-depleting substance throughout the 21st century. Reducing nitrous oxide emissions would thus enhance the rate of recovery of the ozone hole and reduce the anthropogenic forcing of climate. Nitrous oxide causes more stratospheric ozone destruction than any other ozone-depleting substance. By comparing the ozone depletion potential–weighted anthropogenic emissions of N2O with those of other ozone-depleting substances, we show that N2O emission currently is the single most important ozone-depleting emission and is expected to remain the largest throughout the 21st century. N2O is unregulated by the Montreal Protocol. Limiting future N2O emissions would enhance the recovery of the ozone layer from its depleted state and would also reduce the anthropogenic forcing of the climate system,
representing a win-win for both ozone and climate.}}

determine band strengths, rotationless dipole moment matrix elements, and F factor
coefficients for the various bands. First-order nondegenerate perturbation theory
was used to derive explicit expressions for the rotationless dipole moment matrix
elements and F factor coefficients, and from this derivation, general expressions
for the F factor are obtained: F = [1 + a1m + a2J′(J′ + 1) + a3J″(J″ + 1)]2 for Δl = 0, ±1
bands and F = (1 + a1m)2 · H for Δl = ±2, ±3 bands, where H is given to good
approximation for |Δl| = 2 bands as H = [J′(J′ + 1)]2. These F factor expressions
are applied in the analysis of the experimental data from which the vibrational
band strength of the forbidden band 0220(e)–0000 was found to be (5.69 ± 0.26) × 10−8 cm−2/atm at 296 K.
