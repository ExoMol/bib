   present in natural isotopic abundance in the sample. Eight bands are newly reported. The 
   band-by-band analysis allowed for the determination of refined values of the rovibrational 
   parameters of a total of 68 upper vibrational states. Eight 14N216O bands were found to be 
   affected by local rovibrational perturbations and a total of 31 extra lines due to an

Title = {Evaluating the Plausible Range of N2O Biosignatures on Exo-Earths: An
   Integrated Biogeochemical, Photochemical, and Spectral Modeling Approach},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {937},
Abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O)-a product of microbial nitrogen metabolism-is a
   compelling exoplanet biosignature gas with distinctive spectral features
   in the near- and mid-infrared, and only minor abiotic sources on Earth.
   Previous investigations of N2O as a biosignature have examined scenarios
   using Earthlike N2O mixing ratios or surface fluxes, or those inferred
   from Earth's geologic record. However, biological fluxes of N2O could be
   substantially higher, due to a lack of metal catalysts or if the last
   step of the denitrification metabolism that yields N-2 from N2O had
   never evolved. Here, we use a global biogeochemical model coupled with
   photochemical and spectral models to systematically quantify the limits
   of plausible N2O abundances and spectral detectability for Earth analogs
   orbiting main-sequence (FGKM) stars. We examine N2O buildup over a range
   of oxygen conditions (1\%-100\% present atmospheric level) and N2O
   fluxes (0.01-100 teramole per year; Tmol = 10(12) mole) that are
   compatible with Earth's history. We find that N2O fluxes of 10 {[}100]
   Tmol yr(-1) would lead to maximum N2O abundances of similar to 5 {[}50]
   ppm for Earth-Sun analogs, 90 {[}1600] ppm for Earths around late K
   dwarfs, and 30 {[}300] ppm for an Earthlike TRAPPIST-1e. We simulate
   emission and transmission spectra for intermediate and maximum N2O
   concentrations that are relevant to current and future space-based
   telescopes. We calculate the detectability of N2O spectral features for
   high-flux scenarios for TRAPPIST-1e with JWST. We review potential false
   positives, including chemodenitrification and abiotic production via
   stellar activity, and identify key spectral and contextual discriminants
   to confirm or refute the biogenicity of the observed N2O.},

   doubling was investigated by high-resolution and ultra-sensitive cavity
   ring-down spectroscopy coupled with an external-cavity quantum cascade

   doubling constants, Coriolis constants, band centres, rotational
   constants and centrifugal distortion constants for l = 2 state of
   beta-site N2O isotopomer by probing the rotationally resolved spectral

Abstract = {In spite of being a greenhouse gas with a large global warming
   potential, the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide in the near infrared
   is insufficiently characterized. In the present work, the spectral
   region near 1.74 mu m (5696-5910 cm(-1)) is investigated by high
   sensitivity cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). The noise level of the
   CRDS spectra corresponds to a typical minimum detectable absorption,
   alpha(min), below 10(-10) cm(-1). 3326 transitions are measured and
   rovibrationally assigned to 50 bands of five nitrous oxide isotopologues
   ((N2O)-N-14-O-16, (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16, (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16,
   (N2O)-N-14-O-18 and (N2O)-N-14-O-17) in natural isotopic abundance. The
   assigned weakest lines have an intensity below 10(-28)cm/molecule. For
   comparison, only three (N2O)-N-14-O-16 bands are included in the HITRAN
   database in the region, with a 2 x 10(-25)cm/molecule intensity cut off.
   The rovibrational assignments were performed by comparison with
   predictions performed for each isotopologue in the frame of the
   effective operator approach. The overall quality of the predictions is
   satisfactory for line positions. Deviations larger than 0.1 cm(-1) are
   nevertheless noted for (N2O)-N-14-O-16 and (N2O)-N-14-O-18.
   The spectroscopic parameters of the upper level of the observed bands
   were derived from the standard band-by-band fit of the measured line
   positions. A significant number of bands were found to be perturbed by
   local rovibrational perturbations and in some cases, extra lines due to
   an intensity transfer could be assigned. The interaction mechanisms and
   the perturbers were univocally identified on the basis of the effective
   Hamiltonian model. In particular, interpolyad couplings were evidenced
   indicating that the polyad version of the effective Hamiltonian has to
   be extended to include Coriolis and interpolyad anharmonic interactions.
   No satisfactory modeling of the N2O line intensities is yet available in
   the region. The CRDS intensity values derived in this work provide a
   solid set of measurements for future semi-empirical intensity modeling

of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the
present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the
search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient
Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have
compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet
biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally
survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature
but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures.
We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel
methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and
assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived
biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since
the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose

Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {549},
Abstract = {Context. The atmosphere of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting
   different types of stars is influenced by the spectral dependence of the
   incoming stellar radiation. The changes in structure and composition
   affect atmospheric radiation, hence the spectral appearance of these
   exoplanets.
   Aims. We provide a thorough investigation of infrared radiative transfer
   in cloud-free exoplanets atmospheres by not only analyzing the planetary
   spectral appearance but also discussing the radiative processes behind
   the spectral features in detail and identifying the regions in the
   atmosphere that contribute most at a given wavelength.
   Methods. Using cloud-free scenarios provided by a one-dimensional
   radiative-convective steady-state atmospheric model, we computed
   high-resolution infrared transmission and emission spectra, as well as
   weighting functions for exoplanets located within the habitable zone of
   F, G, K, and M stars by means of a line-by-line molecular absorption
   model and a Schwarzschild solver for the radiative transfer. The
   monochromatic spectra were convolved with appropriate spectral response
   functions to study the effects of finite instrument resolution.
   Results. Spectra of the exoplanets of F, G, K, and M stars were analyzed
   in the 4.5 mu m N2O band, the 4.3 mu m and 15 mu m CO2 bands, the 7.7 mu
   m CH4 band, the 6.3 mu m H2O band, and the 9.6 mu m O-3 band.
   Differences in the state of the atmosphere of the exoplanets clearly
   show up in the thermal infrared spectra; absorption signatures known
   from Earth can be transformed to emission features (and vice versa).
   Weighting functions show that radiation in the absorption bands of the
   uniformly mixed gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) and (to some extent) ozone comes
   from the stratosphere and upper troposphere, and also indicate that
   changes in the atmospheres can shift sources of thermal radiation to
   lower or higher altitudes. Molecular absorption and/or emission features
   can be identified in the high-resolution spectra of all planets and in
   most reduced resolution spectra.
   Conclusions. Insight into radiative transfer processes is essential for
   analyzing exoplanet spectral observations; for instance, understanding
   the impact of the temperature profile (nb. non-existence of an
   inversion) on the CO2 bands facilitates their interpretation and can
   help avoid false positive or negative estimates of O-3. The detailed
   analysis of the radiation source and sink regions could even help give
   an indication about the feasibility of identifying molecular signatures
   in cloud-covered planets, i.e. radiation mainly coming from the upper
   atmosphere is less likely to be hidden by clouds. Infrared radiative
   transfer and biomarker detectability in cloud-covered exoplanets will be
   presented in a companion paper.},

abstract = {An approximate N2O spectroscopic database suitable for high temperature
and medium resolution applications has been created in the 4.5 μm region. Intensities
of 14N2 16O hot bands have been extrapolated pragmatically from the v3 band intensity
and energies of vibrational levels have been computed by diagonalization of the
effective Hamiltonian. The new parameters have been merged with the data available
in the HITRAN database and in the recent experimental work of Toth. The entire
list has then been used to generate individual line parameters. Pure N2O spectra
have been recorded with a Fourier Transform spectrometer up to 900 K and with 1
cm−1 resolution. A good agreement between these spectra and line-by-line calculations
using the new database is obtained while the use of HITRAN greatly underestimates
absorption at high temperature.},

abstract = {Line strengths of N2O and its rare isotopic derivatives have been
measured in the 1120–1440-cm−1 spectral region. The spectra were obtained at low
sample pressure and high resolution (0.0054 cm−1), and the data are analyzed to
determine band strengths, rotationless dipole moment matrix elements, and F factor
coefficients for the various bands. First-order nondegenerate perturbation theory
was used to derive explicit expressions for the rotationless dipole moment matrix
elements and F factor coefficients, and from this derivation, general expressions
for the F factor are obtained: F = [1 + a1m + a2J′(J′ + 1) + a3J″(J″ + 1)]2 for Δl = 0, ±1
bands and F = (1 + a1m)2 · H for Δl = ±2, ±3 bands, where H is given to good
approximation for |Δl| = 2 bands as H = [J′(J′ + 1)]2. These F factor expressions
are applied in the analysis of the experimental data from which the vibrational
band strength of the forbidden band 0220(e)–0000 was found to be (5.69 ± 0.26) × 10−8 cm−2/atm at 296 K.
The theoretical results can also be applied to CO2 line strengths.},

Abstract = {All of the infrared absorption bands of N2O that are sufficiently
intense to absorb significantly in the earth's atmosphere are summarized. The
information required to calculate the positions of most of the absorption lines
is tabulated along with the intensities of the band systems. The required data
on line positions that are not yet available are pointed out. Spectral plots of
transmittance and of the absorption coefficient are included for several bands
between 530 and 760/cm and between 1585 and 4000/cm.},

including those with lower vibrational levels $\nu$2, 2$\nu$20, 2$\nu$22,
and $\nu$1. Accurate values of the rotational constants have been obtained,
including the l-type doubling and variations with v and l of the centrifugal
stretching constant. These have been correlated with other data to obtain
improved values of the molecular constants, with particular attention to
the Fermi interaction. Other weak interactions are observed and discussed.},
