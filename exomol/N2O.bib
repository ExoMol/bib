abstract = {Abstract In the coming years and decades, advanced space- and ground-based
observatories will allow an unprecedented opportunity to probe the atmospheres
and surfaces of potentially habitable exoplanets for signatures of life. Life
on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties,
has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality
of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the
present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the
search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient
Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have
compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet
biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally
survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature
but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures.
We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel
methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and
assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived
biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since
the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose
new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but
to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly
disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward. Key Words:

measurements for the , , , , , and isotopomers. The agreement between calculated and
observed values for these isotopomers is shown to be excellent, especially for the
rotational constants. As a result, an unidentified band recently recorded is properly
assigned. The spectroscopic constants computed for the rest of the isotopomers, for
which observed information is much scarcer, have therefore a predictive character.
The vibrational zero point energies for all the N2O isotopomers are also given.},

in the HITRAN database and in the recent experimental work of Toth. The entire
list has then been used to generate individual line parameters. Pure N2O spectra
have been recorded with a Fourier Transform spectrometer up to 900 K and with 1
cm−1 resolution. A good agreement between these spectra and line-by-line calculations
using the new database is obtained while the use of HITRAN greatly underestimates
absorption at high temperature.},

measured in the 1120–1440-cm−1 spectral region. The spectra were obtained at low
sample pressure and high resolution (0.0054 cm−1), and the data are analyzed to
determine band strengths, rotationless dipole moment matrix elements, and F factor
coefficients for the various bands. First-order nondegenerate perturbation theory
was used to derive explicit expressions for the rotationless dipole moment matrix
elements and F factor coefficients, and from this derivation, general expressions
for the F factor are obtained: F = [1 + a1m + a2J′(J′ + 1) + a3J″(J″ + 1)]2 for Δl = 0, ±1
bands and F = (1 + a1m)2 · H for Δl = ±2, ±3 bands, where H is given to good
approximation for |Δl| = 2 bands as H = [J′(J′ + 1)]2. These F factor expressions
are applied in the analysis of the experimental data from which the vibrational
band strength of the forbidden band 0220(e)–0000 was found to be (5.69 ± 0.26) × 10−8 cm−2/atm at 296 K.
The theoretical results can also be applied to CO2 line strengths.},

Abstract : All of the infrared absorption bands of N2O that are sufficiently
intense to absorb significantly in the earth's atmosphere are summarized. The
information required to calculate the positions of most of the absorption lines
is tabulated along with the intensities of the band systems. The required data
on line positions that are not yet available are pointed out. Spectral plots of
transmittance and of the absorption coefficient are included for several bands
between 530 and 760/cm and between 1585 and 4000/cm.},
