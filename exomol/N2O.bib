Abstract = {{We present high-accuracy measurements of the spectroscopic parameters of
   eight nitrous oxide transitions, mainly belonging to the P branch of the
   3v(1) + 2v(2) vibrational band, in the spectral region around
   4982cm(-1). We acquired absorption spectra in pure N2O samples, at
   room-temperature, by means of a diode laser based spectrometer in which
   the laser emission width was effectively narrowed by exploiting the
   optical feedback from a V-shaped high-finesse cavity. The spectrometer
   was assisted by a self-referenced optical frequency comb synthesizer for
   frequency calibration purposes. Light absorption from N2O molecules
   occurred inside a multiple reflections cell, which was placed on the
   transmission from the cavity. The successful application of a global
   fitting approach to a manifold of spectra, involving the symmetric
   uncorrelated version of quadratic speed-dependent hard collision
   profile, allowed us to determine line intensities with an overall
   relative uncertainty of 0.38\%. We found a satisfactory agreement with
   data provided by the HITRAN and NOSD-1000 databases. Self-broadening
   coefficients, speed dependence components of the collisional line
   broadening, and Dicke narrowing parameters were also determined.}},

Pages = {40-49},
Abstract = {{In spite of being a greenhouse gas with a large global warming
   potential, the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide in the near infrared
   is insufficiently characterized. In the present work, the spectral
   region near 1.74 mu m (5696-5910 cm(-1)) is investigated by high
   sensitivity cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). The noise level of the
   CRDS spectra corresponds to a typical minimum detectable absorption,
   alpha(min), below 10(-10) cm(-1). 3326 transitions are measured and
   rovibrationally assigned to 50 bands of five nitrous oxide isotopologues
   ((N2O)-N-14-O-16, (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16, (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16,
   (N2O)-N-14-O-18 and (N2O)-N-14-O-17) in natural isotopic abundance. The
   assigned weakest lines have an intensity below 10(-28)cm/molecule. For
   comparison, only three (N2O)-N-14-O-16 bands are included in the HITRAN
   database in the region, with a 2 x 10(-25)cm/molecule intensity cut off.
   The rovibrational assignments were performed by comparison with
   predictions performed for each isotopologue in the frame of the
   effective operator approach. The overall quality of the predictions is
   satisfactory for line positions. Deviations larger than 0.1 cm(-1) are
   nevertheless noted for (N2O)-N-14-O-16 and (N2O)-N-14-O-18.
   The spectroscopic parameters of the upper level of the observed bands
   were derived from the standard band-by-band fit of the measured line
   positions. A significant number of bands were found to be perturbed by
   local rovibrational perturbations and in some cases, extra lines due to
   an intensity transfer could be assigned. The interaction mechanisms and
   the perturbers were univocally identified on the basis of the effective
   Hamiltonian model. In particular, interpolyad couplings were evidenced
   indicating that the polyad version of the effective Hamiltonian has to
   be extended to include Coriolis and interpolyad anharmonic interactions.
   No satisfactory modeling of the N2O line intensities is yet available in
   the region. The CRDS intensity values derived in this work provide a
   solid set of measurements for future semi-empirical intensity modeling
   in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Resolution and bandwidth are critical for cavity-enhanced dual-comb

   to improve the broadband as well as the resolution. Postcorrections to
   dual-comb interferograms adaptively compensate the relative phase
   jitters of the optical frequency combs and result in both a
   mode-resolved spectral resolution and a signal-to-noise ratio of 440:1
   in 1 s. Meanwhile, an adaptive combcavity locking scheme exploits more
   than 90\% of the comb modes, covering 340 cm(-1) (10 THz) at 6450
   cm(-1). For a single dual-comb interferogram, more than 40,000 comb
   teeth spaced by 250 MHz are measured in less than 7.5 ms, contributing
   to a noise equivalent absorption per spectral element of 2 x 10(-10)

   technique provides an attractive spectroscopic tool that may be utilized

abstract = {Abstract In the coming years and decades, advanced space- and ground-based
observatories will allow an unprecedented opportunity to probe the atmospheres
and surfaces of potentially habitable exoplanets for signatures of life. Life
on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties,
has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality
of the laws of physics and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the
present and through geologic time, for analog signatures that will aid in the
search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from modern and ancient
Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have
compiled a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet
biosignatures, including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally
survey biogenic spectral features that are well known in the specialist literature
but have not yet been robustly vetted in the context of exoplanet biosignatures.
We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature plausibility, including novel
methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely obtainable data and
assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required to maintain short-lived
biogenic gases as atmospheric signatures. We focus particularly on advances made since
the seminal review by Des Marais et al. The purpose of this work is not to propose
new biosignature strategies, a goal left to companion articles in this series, but
to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between seemingly
disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward. Key Words:
