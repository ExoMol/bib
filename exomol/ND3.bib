  abstract = {Several aspects of ammonia rovibrational spectra have been investigated using the new 
  HSL-2 potential energy surface that includes an approximate correction for nonadiabatic effects. 
  The unprecedented accuracy of rovibrational energy levels and transition energies computed using HSL-2 
  was demonstrated in Part I of this study. For 14NH3, new assignments for a few {$\nu$}3 + {$\nu$}4 band 
  transitions and energy levels are suggested, and discrepancies between computed and HITRAN energy levels 
  in the 2{$\nu$}4 band are analyzed (2{$\nu$}4 is the most difficult band below 5000 cm-1). New assignments 
  are suggested for existing or missing 2{$\nu$}4 levels. Several new vibrational bands are identified from 
  existing, unassigned HITRAN data, including 2{$\nu$}2 + {$\nu$}4, ({$\nu$}3 + {$\nu$}4) -A{${'}$}/A{${''}$}, 
  {$\nu$}1 + 2{$\nu$}2, and 2{$\nu$}2 + 2{$\nu$}4. The strong mixing between the 2{$\nu$}4 and 2{$\nu$}2 + {$\nu$}4 
  bands is carefully examined and found to be the source of the difficulties in the experimental modeling of 2{$\nu$}4. 
  Discussion is presented for preliminary J = 10 results, where the overall root-mean-square error is estimated to be 
  less than 0.039 cm-1. The analysis of the 4{$\nu$}2 band demonstrates both the reliability and the accuracy of 
  predictions from HSL-2. The full list of computed J = 0 band origins (with assignments) and the inversion splittings 
  up to 7000\textendash 8000 cm-1 above the zero-point energy are presented. J = 0\textendash 2 levels are reported for 
  those bands below 5100 cm-1 that are missing from the HITRAN database. For 15NH3, excellent agreement is found for the 
  available {$\nu$}2 and {$\nu$}3 + {$\nu$}4(E) transition energies, but significant deficiencies are shown for HITRAN 
  levels and several corrections are suggested. The 15N isotopic effects are presented for the J = 0\textendash 6 levels 
  of 13 HITRAN bands. For 14ND3, we reproduce the pure rotational inversion spectra line frequencies with an accuracy 
  similar to that for 14NH3. However, it is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all four pairs of 
  inversion\textendash split vibrational fundamentals to better than 0.05 cm-1 uncertainty. It is suggested that a 
  reanalysis of some suspicious 14ND3 fundamental bands is required. The analyses presented here and in Part I show 
  that rovibrational energy levels and transition frequencies computed with HSL-2 (with nonadiabatic corrections) remain 
  highly accurate well beyond the experimental data used in the refinement procedure. Calculations using HSL-2 are 
  capable of revealing many deficiencies in experimental analyses of ammonia spectra and provide reliable predictions 
  with similar accuracy. It is expected that the results of this study will be useful in the future interpretation of 
  high-resolution spectra from laboratory experiments or from astronomical observations. The present work represents a 
  very significant advance in the state of our knowledge of the spectroscopy of ammonia and its isotopologues.},
