Abstract = {NH radicals are magnetically trapped and their Zeeman relaxation and

   Continuous buffer-gas loading of the trap is direct from a

   section of magnetically trapped electronic, vibrational, and rotational
   ground state NH molecules in collisions with He-3 is measured to be 3.8
   +/- 1.1x10(-19) cm(2) at 710 mK. The NH-He energy transport cross
   section is also measured, indicating a ratio of diffusive to inelastic
   cross sections of gamma=7x10(4), in agreement with recent theory {[}R.

Title = {Quantum computation with trapped polar molecules},
Journal = PRL,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {88},
Abstract = {We propose a novel physical realization of a quantum computer. The
   qubits are electric dipole moments of ultracold diatomic molecules,
   oriented along or against an external electric field. Individual
   molecules are held in a 1D trap array, with an electric field gradient
   allowing spectroscopic addressing of each site. Bits are coupled via the
   electric dipole-dipole interaction. Using technologies similar to those
   already demonstrated, this design can plausibly lead to a quantum
   computer with greater than or equal to10(4) qubits, which can perform
   similar to10(5) CNOT gates in the anticipated decoherence time of
   similar to5 s.},

   Magnetic Trap}},
Journal = PRL,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the ultracold reaction dynamics of magnetically trapped
   NH(X-3 Sigma(-)) radicals using rigorous quantum scattering calculations
   involving three coupled potential energy surfaces. We find that the
   reactive NH + NH cross section is driven by a short-ranged collisional
   mechanism, and its magnitude is only weakly dependent on magnetic field
   strength. Unlike most ultracold reactions observed so far, the NH + NH
   scattering dynamics is nonuniversal. Our results indicate that chemical
   reactions can cause more trap loss than spin-inelastic NH + NH
   collisions, making molecular evaporative cooling more difficult than
   previously anticipated. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.063201}},

Title = {{The prospects of sympathetic cooling of NH molecules with Li atoms}},
Journal = EPJD,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {151-160},
Abstract = {{We calculate the quartet potential energy surface for Li+NH and use it
   to calculate elastic and spin-relaxation cross sections for collisions
   in magnetically trappable spin-stretched states. The potential is
   strongly anisotropic but spin-relaxation collisions are still suppressed
   by centrifugal barriers when both species are in spin-stretched states.
   In the ultracold regime, both the elastic and inelastic cross sections
   fluctuate dramatically as the potential is varied because of Feshbach
   resonances. The potential-dependence is considerably reduced at higher
   energies. The major effect of using an unconverged basis set in the
   scattering calculations is to shift the resonances without changing
   their general behaviour. We have calculated the ratio of elastic and
   spin-relaxation cross sections, as a function of collision energy and
   magnetic field, for a variety of potential energy surfaces. Most of the
   surfaces produce ratios that are favorable for sympathetic cooling, at
   temperatures below about 20 mK.}},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Abstract = {{A new line list for rovibrational and rotational transitions, including
   fine structure, within the NH X-3 Sigma(-) ground state has been
   created. It contains line intensities in the form of Einstein A and
   f-values, for all possible bands up to v' = 6, and for J up to between
   25 and 44. The intensities are based on a new dipole moment function
   (DMF), which has been calculated using the internally contracted
   multi-reference configuration interaction method with an aug-cc-pV6Z
   basis set. The programs RKR1, LEVEL, and PGOPHER were used to calculate
   line positions and intensities using the most recent spectroscopic line
   position observations and the new DMF, including the rotational
   dependence on the matrix elements. The Hund's case (b) matrix elements
   from the LEVEL output (available as Supplement 1 of the supplementary
   material) have been transformed to the case (a) form required by
   PGOPHER. New relative intensities for the (1,0) band have been measured,
   and the calculated and observed Herman-Wallis effects are compared,
   showing good agreement. The line list (see Supplement 5 of the
   supplementary material) will be useful for the study of NH in astronomy,
   cold and ultracold molecular systems, and in the nitrogen chemistry of
   combustion. }},
