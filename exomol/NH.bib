Journal = PRL,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {98},
Abstract = {NH radicals are magnetically trapped and their Zeeman relaxation and
   energy transport collision cross sections with helium are measured.
   Continuous buffer-gas loading of the trap is direct from a
   room-temperature molecular beam. The Zeeman relaxation (inelastic) cross
   section of magnetically trapped electronic, vibrational, and rotational
   ground state NH molecules in collisions with He-3 is measured to be 3.8
   +/- 1.1x10(-19) cm(2) at 710 mK. The NH-He energy transport cross
   section is also measured, indicating a ratio of diffusive to inelastic
   cross sections of gamma=7x10(4), in agreement with recent theory {[}R.

Title = {Quantum computation with trapped polar molecules},
Journal = PRL,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {88},
Abstract = {We propose a novel physical realization of a quantum computer. The
   qubits are electric dipole moments of ultracold diatomic molecules,
   oriented along or against an external electric field. Individual
   molecules are held in a 1D trap array, with an electric field gradient
   allowing spectroscopic addressing of each site. Bits are coupled via the
   electric dipole-dipole interaction. Using technologies similar to those
   already demonstrated, this design can plausibly lead to a quantum
   computer with greater than or equal to10(4) qubits, which can perform
   similar to10(5) CNOT gates in the anticipated decoherence time of
   similar to5 s.},

Title = {{Line strengths of rovibrational and rotational transitions within the
X $^3\Sigma^-$ ground state of NH}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Abstract = {{A new line list for rovibrational and rotational transitions, including
   fine structure, within the NH X-3 Sigma(-) ground state has been
   created. It contains line intensities in the form of Einstein A and
   f-values, for all possible bands up to v' = 6, and for J up to between
   25 and 44. The intensities are based on a new dipole moment function
   (DMF), which has been calculated using the internally contracted
   multi-reference configuration interaction method with an aug-cc-pV6Z
   basis set. The programs RKR1, LEVEL, and PGOPHER were used to calculate
   line positions and intensities using the most recent spectroscopic line
   position observations and the new DMF, including the rotational
   dependence on the matrix elements. The Hund's case (b) matrix elements
   from the LEVEL output (available as Supplement 1 of the supplementary
   material) have been transformed to the case (a) form required by
   PGOPHER. New relative intensities for the (1,0) band have been measured,
   and the calculated and observed Herman-Wallis effects are compared,
   showing good agreement. The line list (see Supplement 5 of the
   supplementary material) will be useful for the study of NH in astronomy,
   cold and ultracold molecular systems, and in the nitrogen chemistry of
   combustion. }},
