Title = {{Spectroscopic characterization of NH(A3II): Linewidths
   and energy level shifts}},
Journal = SCAA,
Year = {2026},
Volume = {348},
Abstract = {The study of linewidths and energy level shifts in the NH (imidogen)
   molecule provides critical insights into its spectroscopic properties,
   quantum dynamics, and interactions with external environments. This
   study investigates the mechanisms responsible for the broadening and
   shifting observed in the rotational, vibrational, and electronic
   transitions of the NH(A(3)II -> X-3 Sigma(-)) band. The analysis places
   particular emphasis on radiative lifetimes and the influence of spectral
   perturbations. To this end, high-level multireference configuration
   interaction (MRCI) calculations were carried out to construct accurate
   potential energy curves (PECs) for the X-3 Sigma(-), A(3)II, and
   1(5)Sigma(-) states, and included newly developed analytical
   representations for the bound states. For the ground state, we obtained
   R-e = 1.9558 a(0), omega(e) = 3282.6 cm(-1), and D-e = 29084 cm(-1),
   with the A(3)II state lying approximately 29538 cm-1 above. These values
   show good agreement with the available experimental data (R-e = 1.9581
   a(0), omega(e) = 3282.3 cm(-1), and D-e = 29044 cm(-1)). Our main
   results show that these calculations provide a deeper understanding of
   the molecular energy structure and the dynamical mechanisms underlying
   linewidth variations and energy level displacements in light diatomic
   radicals. Using these results, it was},

Title = {{14NH, 14ND, and 15NH cometary
   fluorescence models and D/H measurement in NH}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {702},
Abstract = {Context. NH, a product of dissociation of ammonia, NH<INF>3</INF>,
   produces emission lines in the visible spectral range and its (0-0) band
   has largely been observed in cometary spectra. An updated fluorescence
   model of NH allows measurement of the abundance of the NH radical. This
   fluorescence model can also shed light on the ongoing question of
   isotopic ratios in comets, particularly the D/H ratio. Aims. The aim of
   this NH fluorescence model is to have an updated model to access the
   line positions and intensities in order to identify new lines in the
   observed cometary spectra, compute new fluorescence efficiencies, and
   measure the isotopic ratios 14ND/14NH and
   15NH/14NH. Methods. New laboratory Einstein
   coefficients from ExoMol enabled new fluorescence models for
   14NH, 14ND, and 15NH to be computed. To
   increase the signal-to-noise ratio, we then coadded selected emission
   lines to measure the isotopic ratios 14NH/14ND and
   15NH/14NH in high-resolution spectra of the bright
   comets C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), C/2006 F6 (Lemmon), and
   73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann obtained with UVES at the ESO Very Large
   Telescope. Results. Comparisons of the modeled spectrum of
   14NH and observed comet spectra taken at various heliocentric
   distances confirmed the accuracy of our model. New fluorescence
   efficiencies were calculated for the three isotopologs and found to be
   about 20\% higher than in previous studies. We were able to measure an
   isotopic ratio 14ND/14NH of (2.7 +/- 1.8) x
   10-3 in comet 73P, while no average ND line was detected in
   the two other comets. This is the first D/H ratio measured in the NH
   radical and it is in agreement with the 14ND/14NH
   upper limit of 0.006 found in Comet Hyakutake, and with the ratio
   (D/H)<INF>NH<INF>3</INF></INF> = 1.1 x 10-3 measured in Comet
   67P during the Rosetta mission. Our measurement confirms that the D/H
   ratio is about one order of magnitude larger for cometary
   nitrogen-bearing molecules compared to water. No measurements could be
   carried out regarding the 15NH/14NH ratio, due to
   the limited shift between the lines of both isotopologs.},

   radical in the X-3 Sigma(-) ground state}},
Journal =JQSST,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {291},
Abstract = {The NH radical is an extremely important specie in nitrogen chemical
   reaction networks, in the interstellar medium and atmospheric chemistry.
   Time resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy technique in the frequency
   range 10-13 um has been applied for the measurement of a pure rotational
   spectrum of the NH free radical (NH) in the ground X-3 Sigma(-)
   electronic state. Twelve high N (26-29) triplet-resolved pure rotation
   lines of NH were experimentally observed in the laboratory and compared
   with satellite ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) solar data. In
   addition, discharge-generated vibration-rotation NH radical bands in the
   spectral range 1923-3571 cm(-1) have been measured with a microsecond
   time resolution and spectral resolution of 0.02 cm(-1). The spectra of
   the NH radical have been studied in two experimental arrangements.
   Firstly, in a pulsed positive column discharge of pure hydrogen-nitrogen
   mixture and secondly, in a discharge of nitrogen-ammonia mixture in the
   presence of argon buffer gas. Both production methods are described and
   compared. The population analysis of the experimental spectra was
   performed via modelling using the accurate MoLLIST line lists for NH. It
   was shown that laboratory data can be well reproduced by use of a
   mixture of the local-thermal-equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE models
   corresponding to high temperatures (up to 8000 K and up to 6000 K
   rotational). },

Journal = {Proc. Combustion Inst.},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {1313-1320},
Abstract = {NH is a key short-lived radical involved in the prompt-NO formation.
   Quantification of NH is thus particularly important for testing the NO
   kinetic mechanisms. However, quantitative measurements of native NH in
   hydrocarbon/oxygen/nitrogen flames remain very scarce. Therefore, in
   this work, the mole fractions of native NH were obtained using a
   combination of laser-based diagnostics; Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF)
   and Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS). The NH species was probed
   after exciting the transition R-1 (6) in the A(3)Pi-X-3 Sigma(-) (0-0)
   system at 333.9 nm. The mole fraction profiles of NH were successfully
   obtained in premixed low-pressure flames of CH4/O-2/N-2 and C2H2/O-2/N-2
   at two equivalence ratios of 1.00 and 1.25. The estimated detection
   limit for the NH radical was around 4.5 x 10(8) molecule cm(-3) (i.e. 2
   ppb in mole fraction at 1600 K), which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude
   lower than previous values reported in the literature. These new
   experimental results were compared with predictions by a recently
   developed NO model (namely NOMecha2.0). In the case of the CH4 flames, a
   satisfying agreement between the experiment and model was observed.
   However, in the case of the C2H2 flames, some discrepancies were
   observed. Model analysis has highlighted the importance of the HCCO
   radicals in the NH formation through the HCNO -> HNCO -> NH2 reactions
   pathway. Modification of the rate constant values of the reactions C2H2
   + O and HCCO + O-2, which are key reactions for both the acetylene
   laminar flame speed and the HCCO predictions, has enabled the model to
   satisfactorily predict the experimental NH and NO profiles also in the
   C2H2 flames. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute.},

Abstract = {Co-combustion of 5200 ppm NH3 with a stoichiometric, atmospheric

   are compared with predictions of a chemical mechanism developed by
   Mendiara and Glarborg (2009), with simulations based on solution of
   energy equation as well as on experimental temperature profiles as
   input. Compared with a neat flame, the NH3-doped flame shows a shift in
   position similar to 0.7 mm downstream, as established from the
   measurements of the NH profile. Modelling prediction of post-flame NO
   concentrations in the NH3-doped flame, around 1160 ppm, was within the

Title = {{An evaluation of equilibrium conditions and temperature-dependent
   speciation in a laser-produced air plasma}},
Journal = {Phys. Plasmas},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
pages = {083303},
Abstract = {A laser-produced air plasma is a dynamical system with fundamental
   physical parameters that change significantly during its lifespan. The
   evolution of the spectral features from an air plasma shows broadband
   radiation at early times followed by discrete electronic transitions
   from ions, atoms, and rotational and vibration bands from molecules. The
   molecular band emission from an air plasma typically appears at times
   equal to or greater than 5 mu s and persists for 100's of mu s. In this
   article, an evaluation is made on the temperature evolution and
   speciation in a laser-produced air plasma. The air plasmas are generated
   by focusing 1064 nm, 6 ns pulses from an Nd:YAG laser. High-resolution
   emission spectra of various molecules such as N-2, N-2(+), CN, OH, NH,
   and NO are acquired and fit using spectral models. Fitting of atomic and
   molecular emission features permits tracking of the air spark
   temperature evolution from 1 to 200 mu s. Though the excitation and
   molecular temperatures show a good overlap at times equal to or less
   than 10 mu s, the molecular temperatures obtained from different species
   show a discontinuity at times similar to 30 mu s and this is related to
   shock collapse and subsequent changes in hydrodynamics and chemistry of
   the plume. The fitting of multiple species in broadband spectra has
   permitted calculation of the relative concentrations of various
   molecules as a function of temperature that provides insight into the
   air spark speciation. The measured relative mole fractions from
   laser-induced air plasma are within factors of 2-6 of the values
   estimated by speciation model under the assumption of thermal and
   chemical equilibrium across the temperature ranges studied. Probable
   reasons for the observed deviation in the relative fractions are discussed.},

Pages = {1003-1020},
Abstract = {Plasma-liquid interactions have gained escalated interests over the last
   decade due to their potentials in many applications. The simultaneous
   generation of physicochemical phenomena of interest promotes itself to
   the top of the promising technologies for liquid processing. Here, we
   study the physics of a microwave plasma jet (MWPJ) submerged into water
   and its feasibility to wastewater treatment. We investigate the plasma
   and bubble dynamics using high-speed imaging. The effects of the argon
   flow rate, additive gas, and microwave power on the dynamics are
   examined highlighting the retreating behaviors of plasma channels due to
   the losses of electrons and power caused by nearby water surface. The
   addition of N-2 (< 5\%) to Ar flow results in an oscillatory motion of
   the foremost edge of the plasma channel. We characterize the submerged
   MWPJ using a time- and space-averaged optical emission spectroscopy. We
   found the dominant OH (A-X) molecular band and atomic Ar lines with pure
   Ar flow indicating the effective dissociation of water. Meanwhile, the
   addition of N-2 leads to an intense emission of NH (A-X) molecular band.
   Finally, we assess the submerged MWPJ as a viable method for water
   purification based on the degradation of methylene blue (popular model
   compound). We find a significant improvement in the efficiency by adding
   1-3\% of N-2 to the Ar, which should be attributed to a combined effects
   of NH radicals, having high redox potential, and the backward reactions
   of H2O2 to form OH radicals with NO and NO2.},

Journal = {Plasma Phys. Controlled Fussion},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {60},
pages = {105004},
Abstract = {The leading candidate for impurity seeding in ITER is currently
   nitrogen. To date, there have only been a few studies on the plasma
   chemistry driven by N-2/H-2 seeding and its effect on the
   molecular-activated recombination of incoming atomic hydrogen ions in a
   detached-like scenario. Numerical simulations are needed to provide
   insights into such mechanisms. The numerous plasma chemical reactions
   that may occur in such an environment cannot be entirely included in a
   2- or 3-dimensional code such as Eirene. A complete global plasma model,
   implemented with more than 100 plasma chemical equations and 20 species,
   has been set up on the basis of the Plasimo code. This study shows that
   two main nitrogen-including recombination reaction paths are dominant,
   i.e. the ion conversion of NH followed by dissociative recombination,
   and the proton transfer between H2(+) and N-2, producing N2H+. These two
   processes are referred to as N-MAR (nitrogen molecular-activated
   recombination) and have subsequently been implemented in Eunomia, which
   is a spatially resolved Monte Carlo code designed to simulate the
   neutral inventory in linear plasma machines such as Pilot-PSI and
   Magnum-PSI. To study the effect of N-2 on the overall recombination,
   three studies have been set up, and from a defined puffing location with
   a constant total seeding rate of H-2 + N-2, three N-2 ratios were
   simulated, i.e. 0\%, 5\% and 10\%. The parameter monitored is the
   density of atomic hydrogen, being the final hydrogenic product of any
   recombination mechanism in the scenario considered. The difference in H
   density between the 0\% case and the 10\% case is about a factor of
   three. The importance of NH as an electron donor is highlighted, and the
   N-MAR reaction routes are confirmed to enhance the conversion of ions to
   neutrals, making the heat loads to the divertor plate more tolerable.
   This work is a further step towards a full understanding of the role of
   N-2-H-2 molecules in a detached divertor plasma.},

Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {26272-26279},
Abstract = {In this work, the sonoluminescence of NH radicals has been evaluated as
   a new spectroscopic probe for the nonequilibrium plasma produced by
   multibubble cavitation in liquids. The experiments were performed in
   aqueous ammonia solutions subjected to power ultrasound at low and high
   frequencies and under two different rare gases (Ar and Xe).
   Sonoluminescence (SL) spectroscopy focuses on the emission of the two
   present systems: NH (A(3)Pi-X-3 Sigma(-)) and OH (A(2)Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi).
   Both spectroscopic systems indicate the absence of thermal equilibrium
   during bubble collapse (T-v > T-r) irrespective of the saturating gas.
   When Ar is used as the saturating gas, these emissions can be fitted
   using Specair software and the corresponding rovibronic temperatures are
   derived. Both species indicate a net increase in vibrational
   temperatures with the US frequency. In Xe, the SL spectra exhibit OH
   (C-2 Sigma(+)-A(2)Pi) and NH (c(1) Pi-a(1)Delta) emission bands
   indicating a higher electron temperature compared to Ar. However, in Xe,
   the SL spectra cannot be satisfactorily fitted because of significant
   line broadening. The estimation of the intrabubble pressure via SL
   simulation using Specair software is discussed. Monitoring of the
   sonochemical activity indicates the formation of H-2 and N2H4, while no
   H2O2 accumulates under these conditions. In the presence of Xe, NO is
   also formed as a sonolysis product. The appearance of new possible
   reaction pathways under Xe is made possible by the higher plasma
   electron density and correlates with SL data.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {587},
pages = {A26},
Abstract = {Context. High degrees of deuterium fractionation are commonly found in
   cold prestellar cores and in the envelopes around young protostars. As
   it brings strong constraints to chemical models, deuterium chemistry is
   often used to infer core history or molecule formation pathways. Whereas
   a large number of observations are available regarding interstellar
   deuterated stable molecules, relatively little is known about the
   deuteration of hydride radicals, as their fundamental rotational
   transitions are at high frequencies where the atmosphere is mostly
   opaque.
   Aims. Nitrogen hydride radicals are important species in nitrogen
   chemistry, as they are thought to be related to ammonia formation.
   Observations have shown that ammonia is strongly deuterated, with
   {[}NH2D]/{[}NH3] similar to 10\%. Models predict similarly high
   {[}ND]/{[}NH] ratios, but so far only one observational determination of
   this ratio is available, towards the envelope of the protostar
   IRAS16293-2422. To test model predictions, we aim here to determine
   {[}ND]/{[}NH] in a dense, starless core.
   Methods. We observed NH and ND in 16293E with the HIFI spectrometer on
   board the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the CHESS guaranteed
   time key programme, and derived the abundances of these two species
   using a non local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer model.
   Results. Both NH and ND are detected in the source, with ND in emission
   and NH in absorption against the continuum that arises from the cold
   dust emission. Our model shows, however, that the ND emission and the NH
   absorption originate from different layers in the cloud, as further
   evidenced by their different velocities. In the central region of the
   core, we can set a lower limit to the {[}ND]/{[}NH] ratio of greater
   than or similar to 2\%. This estimate is consistent with recent pure
   gas-phase models of nitrogen chemistry.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {141},
pages = {054310},
Abstract = {A new line list for rovibrational and rotational transitions, including
   fine structure, within the NH X-3 Sigma(-) ground state has been
   created. It contains line intensities in the form of Einstein A and
   f-values, for all possible bands up to v' = 6, and for J up to between
   25 and 44. The intensities are based on a new dipole moment function
   (DMF), which has been calculated using the internally contracted
   multi-reference configuration interaction method with an aug-cc-pV6Z
   basis set. The programs RKR1, LEVEL, and PGOPHER were used to calculate
   line positions and intensities using the most recent spectroscopic line
   position observations and the new DMF, including the rotational
   dependence on the matrix elements. The Hund's case (b) matrix elements
   from the LEVEL output (available as Supplement 1 of the supplementary
   material) have been transformed to the case (a) form required by
   PGOPHER. New relative intensities for the (1,0) band have been measured,
   and the calculated and observed Herman-Wallis effects are compared,
   showing good agreement. The line list (see Supplement 5 of the
   supplementary material) will be useful for the study of NH in astronomy,
   cold and ultracold molecular systems, and in the nitrogen chemistry of
   combustion. },

   Magnetic Trap}},
Journal = PRL,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {110},
pages = {063201},
Abstract = {We investigate the ultracold reaction dynamics of magnetically trapped
   NH(X-3 Sigma(-)) radicals using rigorous quantum scattering calculations
   involving three coupled potential energy surfaces. We find that the
   reactive NH + NH cross section is driven by a short-ranged collisional
   mechanism, and its magnitude is only weakly dependent on magnetic field
   strength. Unlike most ultracold reactions observed so far, the NH + NH
   scattering dynamics is nonuniversal. Our results indicate that chemical
   reactions can cause more trap loss than spin-inelastic NH + NH
   collisions, making molecular evaporative cooling more difficult than
   previously anticipated. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.063201},

Title = {{The prospects of sympathetic cooling of NH molecules with Li atoms}},
Journal = EPJD,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {65},
Pages = {151-160},
Abstract = {We calculate the quartet potential energy surface for Li+NH and use it
   to calculate elastic and spin-relaxation cross sections for collisions
   in magnetically trappable spin-stretched states. The potential is
   strongly anisotropic but spin-relaxation collisions are still suppressed
   by centrifugal barriers when both species are in spin-stretched states.
   In the ultracold regime, both the elastic and inelastic cross sections
   fluctuate dramatically as the potential is varied because of Feshbach
   resonances. The potential-dependence is considerably reduced at higher
   energies. The major effect of using an unconverged basis set in the
   scattering calculations is to shift the resonances without changing
   their general behaviour. We have calculated the ratio of elastic and
   spin-relaxation cross sections, as a function of collision energy and
   magnetic field, for a variety of potential energy surfaces. Most of the
   surfaces produce ratios that are favorable for sympathetic cooling, at
   temperatures below about 20 mK.},

   abundance in oxygen-rich giants through K to late M}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {1997},
Volume = {328},
Pages = {175-186},
Abstract = {The analyses of high resolution infrared spectra have been done for CN
   lines in oxygen-rich cool evolved stars including 2 K giants, 20 M
   giants and 1 S-type star. Since CN lines analyzed in the present work
   are weak and resolved well, they are appropriate for quantitative
   analyses. CN lines of Delta nu = -2 and -1 sequences (red system) which
   are in the K-and the H-window regions, respectively, give the consistent
   nitrogen abundance for each star. The analyses of NH lines in the
   L-window region have been done for 5 late M giants for which CN lines
   have been also analyzed. Although the triplet structure of NH lines
   cannot be fully resolved, they are preferable because determination of
   nitrogen abundance is almost independent of other elemental abundances
   while nitrogen abundance based on CN depends on carbon abundance. The
   nitrogen abundances derived from NH for late M giants agree well with
   those from CN for which we adopt 7.75 eV as the dissociation energy in
   the analysis.
   The results show that the nitrogen abundances in late M giants are
   larger than those in early M giants while decrease of the carbon
   abundance was found in late M giants by our previous work (Tsuji 1991).
   These variations of abundances can not be explained by the first
   dredge-up model but require additional processing by the CN cycle and
   mixing after the first dredge-up. However, there is no obvious evidence
   of other processes such as the 3 alpha-process and subsequent hot bottom
   burning in our program stars. Such variation of the carbon and nitrogen
   abundances is not well understood by the present evolutionary models of
   low-mass and intermediate-mass stars.},

Abstract = {We have obtained an ultra-high-resolution (0.38 km s(-1) FWHM) spectrum
   of the R-1(0) (3358.053 Angstrom) line of interstellar NH towards zeta
   Oph. These observations comprise the first detection of NH towards zeta
   Oph, and the third reported detection of this molecule by
   absorption-line spectroscopy towards any star. The equivalent width
   (0.36 +/- 0.05 m Angstrom) corresponds to a column density of 8.8 +/-
   1.2 x 10(11) cm(-2). This is more than an order of magnitude higher than
   that expected on the basis of equilibrium gas-phase models, but is
   consistent with models incorporating grain-surface chemistry. The line
   profile is fully resolved, and has an intrinsic velocity dispersion
   characterized by b = 1.15 +/- 0.12 km s(-1) This is sufficiently narrow
   to exclude the possibility of hot NH formation through the endothermic
   reaction N + H-2 --> NH + H. There is evidence that the NH Line is split
   into two velocity components (separation 1.26 +/- 0.17 km s(-1)), with
   relative strengths mirroring those of the two CN components towards this
   star. We argue that this correlation also supports the case for grain
   surface reactions dominating the nitrogen chemistry of diffuse molecular clouds.},

   These observations represent the first detection of this molecule

   0.37 +/- 0.08 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 m angstrom for the NH R1(0) lines toward

   cloud is close to previous upper limits  and much greater than that
   predicted by current models of the gas-phase nitrogen chemistry.  The
   incorporation of a more rapid rate for the reaction N+ + H-2 --> NH+ + H
   in these models may provide an effective gas-phase route to explain the
