Abstract = {{NH is a key short-lived radical involved in the prompt-NO formation.
   Quantification of NH is thus particularly important for testing the NO
   kinetic mechanisms. However, quantitative measurements of native NH in
   hydrocarbon/oxygen/nitrogen flames remain very scarce. Therefore, in
   this work, the mole fractions of native NH were obtained using a
   combination of laser-based diagnostics; Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF)
   and Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS). The NH species was probed
   after exciting the transition R-1 (6) in the A(3)Pi-X-3 Sigma(-) (0-0)
   system at 333.9 nm. The mole fraction profiles of NH were successfully
   obtained in premixed low-pressure flames of CH4/O-2/N-2 and C2H2/O-2/N-2
   at two equivalence ratios of 1.00 and 1.25. The estimated detection
   limit for the NH radical was around 4.5 x 10(8) molecule cm(-3) (i.e. 2
   ppb in mole fraction at 1600 K), which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude
   lower than previous values reported in the literature. These new
   experimental results were compared with predictions by a recently
   developed NO model (namely NOMecha2.0). In the case of the CH4 flames, a
   satisfying agreement between the experiment and model was observed.
   However, in the case of the C2H2 flames, some discrepancies were
   observed. Model analysis has highlighted the importance of the HCCO
   radicals in the NH formation through the HCNO -> HNCO -> NH2 reactions
   pathway. Modification of the rate constant values of the reactions C2H2
   + O and HCCO + O-2, which are key reactions for both the acetylene
   laminar flame speed and the HCCO predictions, has enabled the model to
   satisfactorily predict the experimental NH and NO profiles also in the
   C2H2 flames. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute.}},

Journal = AA,
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{328}},
Pages = {175-186},
Abstract = {{The analyses of high resolution infrared spectra have been done for CN
   lines in oxygen-rich cool evolved stars including 2 K giants, 20 M
   giants and 1 S-type star. Since CN lines analyzed in the present work
   are weak and resolved well, they are appropriate for quantitative
   analyses. CN lines of Delta nu = -2 and -1 sequences (red system) which
   are in the K-and the H-window regions, respectively, give the consistent
   nitrogen abundance for each star. The analyses of NH lines in the
   L-window region have been done for 5 late M giants for which CN lines
   have been also analyzed. Although the triplet structure of NH lines
   cannot be fully resolved, they are preferable because determination of
   nitrogen abundance is almost independent of other elemental abundances
   while nitrogen abundance based on CN depends on carbon abundance. The
   nitrogen abundances derived from NH for late M giants agree well with
   those from CN for which we adopt 7.75 eV as the dissociation energy in
   the analysis.
   The results show that the nitrogen abundances in late M giants are
   larger than those in early M giants while decrease of the carbon
   abundance was found in late M giants by our previous work (Tsuji 1991).
   These variations of abundances can not be explained by the first
   dredge-up model but require additional processing by the CN cycle and
   mixing after the first dredge-up. However, there is no obvious evidence
   of other processes such as the 3 alpha-process and subsequent hot bottom
   burning in our program stars. Such variation of the carbon and nitrogen
   abundances is not well understood by the present evolutionary models of
   low-mass and intermediate-mass stars.}},

Abstract = {{We have obtained an ultra-high-resolution (0.38 km s(-1) FWHM) spectrum
   of the R-1(0) (3358.053 Angstrom) line of interstellar NH towards zeta
   Oph. These observations comprise the first detection of NH towards zeta
   Oph, and the third reported detection of this molecule by
   absorption-line spectroscopy towards any star. The equivalent width
   (0.36 +/- 0.05 m Angstrom) corresponds to a column density of 8.8 +/-
   1.2 x 10(11) cm(-2). This is more than an order of magnitude higher than
   that expected on the basis of equilibrium gas-phase models, but is
   consistent with models incorporating grain-surface chemistry. The line
   profile is fully resolved, and has an intrinsic velocity dispersion
   characterized by b = 1.15 +/- 0.12 km s(-1) This is sufficiently narrow
   to exclude the possibility of hot NH formation through the endothermic
   reaction N + H-2 --> NH + H. There is evidence that the NH Line is split
   into two velocity components (separation 1.26 +/- 0.17 km s(-1)), with
   relative strengths mirroring those of the two CN components towards this
   star. We argue that this correlation also supports the case for grain
   surface reactions dominating the nitrogen chemistry of diffuse molecular

   0.37 +/- 0.08 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 m angstrom for the NH R1(0) lines toward

   cloud is close to previous upper limits  and much greater than that

   incorporation of a more rapid rate for the reaction N+ + H-2 --> NH+ + H
   in these models may provide an effective gas-phase route to explain the
   NH abundance.  A contribution involving the direct or indirect

Abstract = {{We calculate the quartet potential energy surface for Li+NH and use it

   In the ultracold regime, both the elastic and inelastic cross sections

   energies. The major effect of using an unconverged basis set in the
