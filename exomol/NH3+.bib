  abstract = {We report the calculation of a six-dimensional CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ
	potential energy surface for the electronic ground state of NH3+
	together with the corresponding CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ dipole moment
	and polarizability surface of (NH3+)-N-14. These electronic properties
	have been computed on a large grid of molecular geometries. A number
	of newly calculated band centers are presented along with the associated
	electric-dipole transition moments. We further report the first calculation
	of vibrational matrix elements of the polarizability tensor components
	for (NH3+)-N-14; these matrix elements determine the intensities
	of Raman transitions. In addition, the rovibrational absorption spectra
	of the nu(2), nu(3), nu(4), 2 nu(2) - nu(2), and nu(2) + nu(3) -
	nu(2) bands have been simulated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights
