Title = {{First unambiguous detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of a planetary
   mass companion with JWST/MIRI coronagraphs}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {693},
Abstract = {Context. The newly accessible mid-infrared (MIR) window offered by the
   James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for exoplanet imaging is expected to
   provide valuable information to characterize their atmospheres. In
   particular, coronagraphs on board the JWST Mid-InfraRed instrument
   (MIRI) are capable of imaging the coldest directly imaged giant planets
   at the wavelengths where they emit most of their flux. The MIRI
   coronagraphs have been specially designed to detect the NH3 absorption
   around 10.5 mu m, which has been predicted by atmospheric models and
   should be detectable for planets colder than 1200 K. Aims. We aim to
   assess the presence of NH3 while refining the atmospheric parameters of
   one of the coldest companions detected by directly imaging GJ 504 b. Its
   mass is still a matter of debate and depending on the host star age
   estimate, the companion could either be placed in the brown dwarf regime
   of similar to 20 M-Jup or in the young Jovian planet regime of similar
   to 4 M-Jup. Methods. We present an analysis of new MIRI observations,
   using the coronagraphic filters F1065C, F1140C, and F1550C of the GJ 504
   system. We took advantage of previous observations of reference stars to
   build a library of images and to perform a more efficient subtraction of
   the stellar diffraction pattern. We used an atmospheric grid from the
   Exo-REM model to refine the atmospheric parameters by combining archival
   near-infrared (NIR) photometry with the MIR photometry. Results. We
   detected the presence of NH3 at 12.5 sigma and measured its volume
   mixing ratio of 10(-5.3 +/- 0.07) in the atmosphere of GJ 504 b. These
   results are in line with atmospheric model expectations for a
   planetary-mass object and observed in brown dwarfs within a similar
   temperature range. The best-fit model with Exo-REM provides updated
   values of its atmospheric parameters, yielding a temperature of T-eff =
   512 +/- 10 K and radius of R = 1.08(-0.03)(+0.04) R-Jup. Conclusions.
   These observations demonstrate the capability of MIRI coronagraphs to
   detect NH3 and to provide the first MIR observations of one of the
   coldest directly imaged companions. Overall, NH3 is a key molecule for
   characterizing the atmospheres of cold planets, offering valuable
   insights into their surface gravity. These observations provide valuable
   information for future spectroscopic observations planned with JWST, in
   particular, with the MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS), which
   will allow us to characterize the atmosphere of GJ 504 b in depth.},

abstract = {Recent investigations on ammonia as a sustainable fuel highlight the need for proper modelling of the radiative heat transfer in ammonia–air flames. As a result, the present work reports on spectral databases that have been specifically generated, leading to the development of various spectral models, ranging from narrow band models to global ones. These models have been tested against the exact line-by-line (LBL) model for an extended pressure range (1–50 atm) in both premixed and non-premixed flame configurations. Noticeably, the premixed flame structure, which can be represented by a two-layer system, is a challenging configuration for correlated-k distribution models. For this configuration, a detailed investigation of the spectral models on various flame fields led to the conclusion that in spite of a higher computational cost, the Statistical Narrow Band Correlated k-distribution (SNBCK) models are better suited for modelling the radiative processes compared to the full spectrum models, such as the Rank Correlated Full-Spectrum k-distribution (RCFSK), Multi-Scale Rank Correlated Full-Spectrum k-distribution (MSRCFSK), and Weighted Sum of Grey Gases (WSGG). Considering the computational load, a reduced SNBCK model, referred to as SNBCK25, was developed and demonstrated high agreement with the LBL model. As an illustration, for a spherically expanding premixed flame at 20 atm, the SNBCK model had a mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 1.17%, while the SNBCK25, RCFSK with double integration, MSRCFSK, and WSGG models resulted in MARE of 1.87%, 4.62%, 8.23%, and 34.7%, respectively, against the LBL model. It is worth mentioning that the contributions of NO, NO2, and N2O were not significant to the evaluation of the divergence of radiative heat flux in the LBL model. Hence, these three species were ignored in the subsequent radiative computations.}}

Title = {Spatial Variations of Jovian Tropospheric Ammonia via Ground-Based
   Imaging},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Current understanding of the ammonia distribution in Jupiter's
   atmosphere is provided by observations from major ground-based
   facilities and spacecraft, and analyzed with sophisticated retrieval
   models that recover high fidelity information, but are limited in
   spatial and temporal coverage. Here we show that the ammonia abundance
   in Jupiter's upper troposphere, which tracks the overturning atmospheric
   circulation, can be simply, but reliably determined from
   continuum-divided ammonia and methane absorption-band images made with a
   moderate-sized Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT). In 2020-2021, Jupiter
   was imaged in the 647-nm ammonia absorption band and adjacent continuum
   bands with a 0.28-m SCT, demonstrating that the spatially resolved
   ammonia optical depth could be determined with such a telescope. In
   2022-2023, a 619 nm methane-band filter was added to provide a constant
   reference against which to correct the ammonia abundances
   (column-averaged mole fraction) for cloud opacity variations. These
   0.28-m SCT results are compared with observations from: (a) the MUSE
   instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (b) the TEXES mid-infrared
   spectrometer used on NASA's InfraRed Telescope Facility; and (c) the
   Gemini telescopes, and are shown to provide reliable maps of ammonia
   abundance. Meridional and longitudinal features are examined, including
   the Equatorial Zone (EZ) ammonia enhancement, the North Equatorial Belt
   depletion, depletion above the Great Red Spot, and longitudinal
   enhancements in the northern EZ. This work demonstrates meaningful
   ammonia monitoring can be achieved with small telescopes that can
   complement spacecraft and major ground-based facility observations.
   On Jupiter, ammonia-in addition to water-forms clouds, precipitates, and
   evaporates. The main clouds we see are commonly thought to be made of
   ammonia ice, with ``coloring agents{''} that provide sometimes vivid
   hues. Where ammonia is and is not provides a powerful tracer of weather
   processes on Jupiter, making it important for understanding the planet
   and others like it. Most measurements of ammonia are made using large
   astronomical facilities or spacecraft. However, because of competition
   for observing time at large telescope facilities and the limited views
   of spacecraft, professional observations may only occur a few times a
   year or only cover part of Jupiter. We show here that useful
   measurements of ammonia can be made with small telescopes and equipment
   available to many amateur astronomers. By comparing images that show
   absorption due to ammonia and methane gases, we can determine the
   variation in the amount of ammonia in and above Jupiter's clouds. We
   have compared our small telescope measurements with those from large
   professional telescopes and found similar results on the distribution of
   ammonia. Our observation method means that non-professional observers
   can fill observational gaps and provide context for professional
   observing campaigns.
   Ground-based, narrow-band imaging with a small telescope reveals
   spatially resolved ammonia abundance in Jupiter's upper troposphere
   Values from disk-averages, meridional profiles, and two-dimensional maps
   compare favorably with large instrument results Small observatory
   observations can offer frequent observations to provide context and
   continuity for professional research programs},

Journal = SCAA,
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {A mid -infrared quantum cascade laser (Mid-IR QCL) coupled with a Single
   Pass Cell and a Multi Pass Cell, was utilized to measure ammonia (NH 3 )
   absorption spectroscopic parameters and determine NH 3 impurities toward
   three emerging applications. We for the first time measured the pressure
   broadening coefficients perturbed by Air, O 2 , N 2 , He, CO 2 , CH 4 ,
   and H 2 and the line intensities of six NH 3 transition lines near
   1084.6 cm - 1 . The measured NH 3 -He, NH 3 -Air, and NH 3 -CO 2
   broadening coefficients align with HITRAN database, while NH 3 -H 2
   coefficients exhibit a maximum discrepancy of 46 \%. Deviations between
   the measured line intensities and HITRAN database are minimal.
   Nevertheless, the uncertainties of line intensities have been
   significantly reduced from 20 \% in HITRAN to below 3 \%. The newly
   measured line parameters are utilized to address NH 3 impurity
   requirements outlined in CCUS (ISO 27913:2016), Biomethane (EN
   16723:2016), and H 2 (ISO 14687:2019) standards. Based on the concept of
   optical gas standard (OGS), the NH 3 impurity detection requirements in
   all three standards have been fulfilled with an uncertainty of 1.35 \%.
   The precision of the NH 3 -OGS is 800 part per trillion (ppt) with an
   integration time of 100 s. The repeatability of the NH 3 -OGS is 130 ppt
   for a continuous measurement time of 48 min. Notably, the NH 3 -OGS
   effectively addresses the highly nonlinear adsorption-desorption
   dynamics, underscoring the potential of OGS as a calibration -free and
   SI-traceable metrological gas analysis instrument.},

   a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser (Mid-IR QCL) based tunable diode laser absorption 
   spectroscopy (TDLAS) spectrometer was developed. It was coupled with two reactors, namely 
   a gas cell and a shock tube and operated in three modes: low- and high-frequency (140 Hz and 
   10 kHz) scan modes and fixed-wavelength mode, tailored to the specific needs of each 
   experimental scenario. The primary objects were NH3 line parameters measurement and 
   absolute NH3 quantification. With the 140 Hz low-frequency scan mode, NH3-Ar pressure 
   broadening coefficients of six transition lines near 1084.6 cm-1 were measured in a gas 
   cell at 295 K and 1–11 mbar for the first time. These coefficients were subsequently employed 
   to quantify the initial NH3 mole fraction in shock tube experiments, considering the 
   substantial adsorption effect of NH3. Using the high-frequency scan mode (10 kHz), spectrally 
   resolved NH3 absorption cross-sections were obtained in a shock tube across a pressure range 
   of 1.46–3.25 bar and a temperature range of 1000–1800 K. This data, acquired for the first time, 
   significantly contributes to the understanding of NH3 behavior in high-temperature environments. 
   Additionally, potential interference from high-temperature water absorption near 1084.6 cm-1 was 
   thoroughly examined. The high-temperature water absorption cross-section was measured over a 
   pressure range of 0.99–3.02 bar and a temperature range of 1322–2905 K, utilizing a 
   near-infrared water laser. Leveraging these comprehensive datasets, the study quantified the 
   NH3 mole fraction during the NH3 oxidation process in the shock tube, employing the 
   fixed-wavelength mode to achieve high time resolution. The quantified NH3 mole fraction 
   was then compared to predictions from eleven recent chemical kinetic mechanisms, demonstrating 
   the utility of the developed spectrometer in validating these mechanisms.}

Title = {{$^{15}$NH$_3$ in the atmosphere of a cool brown dwarf}},
Journal = {Nature},
Volume={624}, 
pages={263-266},
Year = {2023},
Abstract = {Brown dwarfs serve as ideal laboratories for studying the atmospheres of
   giant exoplanets on wide orbits, as the governing physical and chemical
   processes within them are nearly identical(1,2). Understanding the
   formation of gas-giant planets is challenging, often involving the
   endeavour to link atmospheric abundance ratios, such as the
   carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio, to formation scenarios(3). However, the
   complexity of planet formation requires further tracers, as the
   unambiguous interpretation of the measured C/O ratio is fraught with
   complexity(4). Isotope ratios, such as deuterium to hydrogen and
   N-14/N-15, offer a promising avenue to gain further insight into this
   formation process, mirroring their use within the Solar System(5,6,7).
   For exoplanets, only a handful of constraints on C-12/C-13 exist,
   pointing to the accretion of C-13-rich ice from beyond the CO iceline of
   the disks(8,9). Here we report on the mid-infrared detection of the
   (NH3)-N-14 and (NH3)-N-15 isotopologues in the atmosphere of a cool
   brown dwarf with an effective temperature of 380 K in a spectrum taken
   with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. As expected, our
   results reveal a N-14/N-15 value consistent with star-like formation by
   gravitational collapse, demonstrating that this ratio can be accurately
   constrained. Because young stars and their planets should be more
   strongly enriched in the N-15 isotope(10), we expect that (NH3)-N-15
   will be detectable in several cold, wide-separation exoplanets.},

Journal = {{Astrobiology}},
Abstract = {{Ammonia (NH3) in a terrestrial planet atmosphere is generally a good
   biosignature gas, primarily because terrestrial planets have no
   significant known abiotic NH3 source. The conditions required for NH3 to
   accumulate in the atmosphere are, however, stringent. NH3's high water
   solubility and high biousability likely prevent NH3 from accumulating in
   the atmosphere to detectable levels unless life is a net source of NH3
   and produces enough NH3 to saturate the surface sinks. Only then can NH3
   accumulate in the atmosphere with a reasonable surface production flux.
   For the highly favorable planetary scenario of terrestrial planets with
   hydrogen (H-2)-dominated atmospheres orbiting M dwarf stars (M5V), we
   find that a minimum of about 5 ppm column-averaged mixing ratio is
   needed for NH3 to be detectable with JWST, considering a 10 ppm JWST
   systematic noise floor. When the surface is saturated with NH3 (i.e.,
   there are no NH3-removal reactions on the surface), the required
   biological surface flux to reach 5 ppm is on the order of 10(10)
   molecules/(cm(2)center dot s), comparable with the terrestrial
   biological production of methane (CH4). However, when the surface is
   unsaturated with NH3, due to additional sinks present on the surface,
   life would have to produce NH3 at surface flux levels on the order of
   10(15) molecules/(cm(2)center dot s) (similar to 4.5 x 10(6) Tg/year).
   This value is roughly 20,000 times greater than the biological
   production of NH3 on the Earth and about 10,000 times greater than
   Earth's CH4 biological production. Volatile amines have similar
   solubilities and reactivities to NH3 and hence share NH3's weaknesses
   and strengths as a biosignature. Finally, to establish NH3 as a
   biosignature gas, we must rule out mini-Neptunes with deep atmospheres,
   where temperatures and pressures are high enough for NH3's atmospheric
   production.}},

Journal = JQSRT,

Volume = {{277}},
Abstract = {{Room temperature absorption spectra of ammonia have been recorded by
   high-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy in the range 3900-4700
   cm(-1) at four pressures (13, 46, 140, and 304 Pa). The investigated
   spectral region overlaps the important 2.3 mu m atmospheric transparency
   window. 8419 absorption lines were retrieved from the recorded spectra.
   Line intensities range between 1 x 10(-25) and 1.6 x 10(-20)
   cm/molecule. The rovibrational assignments, relying on the position and
   intensity agreement with the C2018 theoretical line list (Coles et al.
   2018), were validated by the systematic use of Lower State Combination
   Difference (LSCD) relations. 6052 transitions were assigned to 51
   vibrational bands of the main isotopologue, (NH3)-N-14, and 625
   transitions of the (NH3)-N-15 minor isotopologue were identified.
   Overall, the assigned transitions represent over 99.8\% of the
   integrated absorption at room temperature in the region. The upper state
   empirical energy of a total of 2287 rovibrational levels of (NH3)-N-14
   were derived. Among them, 1870 are newly reported. The achieved quality
   of the LSCD relations indicates that the accuracy of the derived energy
   levels is better than 0.001 cm(-1). Comparison with the HITRAN2020 list
   shows that the present results will be valuable in improving the ammonia
   spectroscopic databases in the region, both in terms of completeness and
   accuracy of the line positions and line intensities. A recommended line
   list for ammonia in natural isotopic abundance is provided for the
   studied region. }},

Definitive rovibrational quantum numbers were assigned for 1602 transitions pertaining to 809 upper levels and eight vibrational bands: 0111E, 0111A, 1101, 0310, 0211, 1300, 0103 and 0302. When compared to the results from Cacciani et al.

We have further made new assignments for 179 transitions that were not assigned in their work, plus assignments for 87 new lines reported for the first time. Excellent agreement (± 0.002 cm-1) was observed in the line positions between this work and Cacciani et al., with no systematic discrepancies. Remaining discrepancies on the assignments have been attributed to line blendings, unaccounted resonances, the uncertainties of reference line lists, and limited transition-matching accuracy. An empirical line list (JPL) and a semi-empirical line list adopting the UCL-C2018 [Coles et al., JQSRT 2018, 219:199] intensity with the Ames HSL-Pre3 based line positions were employed as the major reference for our analysis. In addition to the line position / intensity measurements and cross-validation through combination difference analysis, part of the work has also required manual matches for valid transition and level pairs and checking the consistency and patterns of δΕCalc-Obs, inversion splittings Δa-s, etc. Band-by-band discussions are presented on the missing intensity of ν2+3ν4 (0103), the unusual sensitivity of ν1+3ν2 (1300) s levels, the borrowed intensity of 6ν2 (0600), and potential outliers of ν1+ν2+ν4 (1101), etc. These will be the topics in our future work.}

Title = {{New Ab Initio Potential Energy Surfaces for NH3 Constructed from
   Explicitly Correlated Coupled-Cluster Methods}},
Journal = JPCA,
year={2022},
Abstract = {{Accurate calculation of ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) for
   the NH3 molecule is a difficult task because of the poor convergence of
   the standard CCSD(T) method with respect to the basis size. Currently,
   the best available NH3 PESs contain empirically refined parameters. In
   this paper, we show that CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCV6Z calculations are not
   sufficient to properly describe the PES over a large range of nuclear
   configurations. However, the PES obtained by the extrapolation of the
   CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pCVXZ (X = T, Q 5, and 6) energies to the complete basis
   set limit is closer to that based on the explicitly correlated
   CCSD(T)-F12a method using the cc-pCVQZ-F12 orbital basis set. All of the
   ab initio PESs constructed in this work include the following
   corrections: one electron relativistic effects, diagonal
   Born-Oppenheimer correction, and high-order electronic correlations
   (CCSDT, CCSDTQ and CCSDTQP). Finally, the root-mean-square deviation
   between the predicted band centers obtained from our final ``pure{''} ab

The integrated line profile is consistent with other molecular and atomic emission lines which have resolved kinematics well modelled by a 5\,kpc-diameter rotating disc. This implies that the gas responsible for NH3 emission is broadly tracing the global molecular reservoir, but likely distributed in pockets of high density (n {$\greaterequivlnt$} 5~{\texttimes}~104\,cm-3). With a luminosity of 2.8~{\texttimes}~106\,L{$\odot$}, the NH3 emission represents 2.5~{\texttimes}~10-7 of the total infrared luminosity of the galaxy, comparable to the ratio observed in the Kleinmann--Low nebula in Orion and consistent with sites of massive star formation in the Milky Way. If \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm NH\_3\}/L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm IR\}\$ serves as a proxy for the `mode' of star formation, this hints that the nature of star formation in extreme starbursts in the early Universe is similar to that of Galactic star-forming regions, with a large fraction of the cold interstellar medium in this state, plausibly driven by a storm of violent disc instabilities in the gas-dominated disc. This supports the `full of Orions' picture of star formation in the most extreme galaxies seen close to the peak epoch of stellar mass assembly.},

Abstract = {Ultra-cool brown dwarfs offer a unique window into understanding
   substellar atmospheric physics and chemistry. Their strong molecular
   absorption bands at infrared wavelengths, Jupiter-like radii, cool
   temperatures, and lack of complicating stellar irradiation make them
   ideal test beds for understanding Jovian-like atmospheres. Here, we
   report the findings of a uniform atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set
   of 14 Y- and T-type dwarfs observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide
   Field Camera 3 instrument. From our retrieval analysis, we find the
   temperature structures to be largely consistent with
   radiative-convective equilibrium in most objects. We also determine the
   abundances of water, methane, and ammonia, as well as upper limits on
   the alkali metals sodium and potassium. The constraints on water and
   methane are consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium
   models, while those of ammonia may be affected by vertical
   disequilibrium mixing, consistent with previous works. Our key result
   stems from the constraints on the alkali metal abundances where we find
   their continued depletion with decreasing effective temperature,
   consistent with the trend identified in a previous retrieval analysis on
   a sample of slightly warmer late T-dwarfs in Line et al. (2017). These
   constraints show that the previously observed Y-J color trend across the
   T/Y transition is most likely due to the depletion of these metals, in
   accordance with predictions from equilibrium condensate rainout
   chemistry. Finally, we simulate future James Webb Space Telescope
   observations of ultra-cool dwarfs and find that the Near Infrared
   Spectrometer (NIRSpec) PRISM offers the best chance at developing
   high-precision constraints on fundamental atmospheric characteristics.},

At high laser frequencies with a long pulse width, a stable non-ionizing state with a laser-induced hybridization of the electrons is formed. For ammonia, aligned with the linear polarization direction of the laser, such stable states can be realized. Electronic hybridization in the presence of the high-frequency field is such that the lone pair propensity is dynamically equalized on either side of ammonia. This leads to a destabilization of pyramidal ammonia and hovering states with the electron density flipping to either side of the geometry. Electronic structure calculations in an oscillating frame of reference anticipate this effect with a predicted classical quiver distance of 0.1 Å. Electronic dynamics at a laser intensity of 1.14 × 1013 W/cm2 and a frequency of 8.16 eV predicts negligible ionization for the planar geometry. Approximate nuclear wave packet dynamics in the oscillating potential energy generated by the electrons predicts a trapping of ammonia in its planar transition state geometry. }

Jupiter}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {302},
Pages = {426-436},
Abstract = {Observations of the visible/near-infrared reflectance spectrum of
   Jupiter have been made with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi Unit
   Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument in the spectral range 0.480.93
   mu m in support of the NASA/Juno mission. These spectra contain spectral
   signatures of gaseous ammonia (NH3), whose abundance above the cloud
   tops can be determined if we have reliable information on its absorption
   spectrum. While there are a number of sources of NH3 absorption data in
   this spectral range, they cover small sub-ranges, which do not
   necessarily overlap and have been determined from a variety of sources.
   There is thus considerable uncertainty regarding the consistency of
   these different sources when modelling the reflectance of the entire
   visible/near-IR range. In this paper we analyse the VLT/MUSE
   observations of Jupiter to determine which sources of ammonia absorption
   data are most reliable. We find that the band model coefficients of
   Bowles et al. (2008) provide, in general, the best combination of
   reliability and wavelength coverage over the MUSE range. These band data
   appear consistent with ExoMOL ammonia line data of Yurchenko et al.
   (2011), at wavelengths where they overlap, but these latter data do not
   cover the ammonia absorption bands at 0.79 and 0.765 mu m, which are
   prominent in our MUSE observations. However, we find the band data of
   Bowles et al. (2008) are not reliable at wavelengths less than 0.758 mu
   m. At shorter wavelengths we find the laboratory observations of Lutz
   and Owen (1980) provide a good indication of the position and shape of
   the ammonia absorptions near 0.552 mu m and 0.648 mu m, but their
   absorption strengths appear inconsistent with the band data of Bowles et
   al. (2008) at longer wavelengths. Finally, we find that the line data of
   the 0.648 mu m absorption band of Giver et al. (1975) are not suitable
   for modelling these data as they account for only 17\% of the band
   absorption and cannot be extended reliably to the cold temperatures and
   H-2/He-broadening conditions found in Jupiter's atmosphere. This work is
   of significance not only for solar system planetary physics, but also
   for future proposed observations of Jupiter-like planets orbiting other
   stars, such as with NASA's planned Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope

Title = {{Absolute line intensities and first measurements of self-collisional
   broadening and shift coefficients in the 2 nu(4) band of NH3}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2018},
Volume = {354},
Pages = {24-31},
Abstract = {Absolute line intensities and a first determination of self-broadening
   and shift coefficients are presented here, deduced from room temperature
   measurements for 302 rovibrational lines of NH3 in the 2 nu(4) band,
   using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These lines, ranging from
   1 <= J <= 11 to 0 <= K <= 11, are located in the 3060-3580 cm(-1)
   spectral range. The lines were fitted with a single spectrum non-linear
   least squares fitting procedure. The absence of signature in the
   residuals suggests that the Voigt profile is well suited to fit the
   experimental line shapes without the need of taking into account line
   mixing effects, in the pressure range used. Average absolute accuracies
   of the measurements are estimated to +/- 4\% for line intensities and
   self-broadening coefficients and to +/- 13\% for self-shift
   coefficients. The J and K dependences of the self-broadening
   coefficients have been observed and modeled using an empirical
   polynomial expression. The results are compared with previous
   experimental and calculated data. Our absolute line intensities, S-0,
   are in good agreement with previous work and HITRAN2016 database, but
   with a reduced uncertainty. The self-broadening coefficients, gamma(0),
   as well as the pressure shift coefficients, delta(0), are in reasonable
   agreement with those reported for various vibrational bands in the 3 mu
   m spectral region, which indicates that no obvious vibrational
   dependence was observed. For shift coefficients, it should be noted that
   this is not the case in many studies which put in evidence a large
   dependence with vibrational excitation. This study complements the
   existing line parameters in the 3 mu m spectral region, essential for
   the analysis of atmospheric spectra. For this purpose, the complete list
   of measurements is provided as supplementary material.},

emissions dominate natural ones and mostly originate from agricultural, domestic
and industrial activities7. However, the total ammonia budget and the attribution
of emissions to specific sources remain highly uncertain across different spatial
scales7-9. Here we identify, categorize and quantify the world’s ammonia emission
hotspots using a high-resolution map of atmospheric ammonia obtained from almost
a decade of daily IASI satellite observations. We report 248 hotspots with diameters
smaller than 50 kilometres, which we associate with either a single point source
or a cluster of agricultural and industrial point sources—with the exception of
one hotspot, which can be traced back to a natural source. The state-of-the-art
EDGAR emission inventory10 mostly agrees with satellite-derived emission fluxes 
within a factor of three for larger regions. However, it does not adequately
represent the majority of point sources that we identified and underestimates
the emissions of two-thirds of them by at least one order of magnitude. Industrial
emitters in particular are often found to be displaced or missing. Our results
suggest that it is necessary to completely revisit the emission inventories of
anthropogenic ammonia sources and to account for the rapid evolution of such
sources over time. This will lead to better health and environmental impact
assessments of atmospheric ammonia and the implementation of suitable nitrogen

Abstract = {There is increasing industrial demand, particularly within the clean

Abstract = {Interpretations of exoplanetary transmission spectra have been
   undermined by apparent obscuration due to clouds/hazes. Debate rages on
   whether weak H2O features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or
   inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar H2O abundances have
   relied on making a priori model assumptions, for example,
   chemical/radiative equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this
   problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We
   introduce POSEIDON, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm
   including generalized inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this
   prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and
   prominent molecular abundances. We apply POSEIDON to the best
   transmission spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD
   209458b, uncovering new insights into its atmosphere at the day-night
   terminator. We extensively explore the parameter space with an
   unprecedented 108 models, spanning the continuum from fully cloudy to
   cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework. We
   report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry (NH3 and/or HCN) in an
   exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7-7.7 sigma confidence, non-uniform cloud
   coverage at 4.5-5.4 sigma, high-altitude hazes at > 3 sigma and
   sub-solar H2O at greater than or similar to 3-5 sigma, depending on the
   assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH3 at 3.3 sigma, and 4.9 sigma
   for fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model
   with the highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H2O at 5-15 ppm
   (0.01-0.03) x solar and NH3 at 0.01-2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting
   disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions.

Abstract = {The target gas molecular absorption spectrum parameters especially line
   strengths are very important for measuring temperature and concentration

   Usually, researchers use line strengths which come from spectrum
   database, like HITRAN and GEISA and HITEMP spectra database, but those
   database include values from the theoretical computation, as is well
   known, there is a big error between the theoretical value and the actual
   value. In order to modify the line strengths of the database, 20 ammonia
   spectrum absorption lines in a wavenumber range between 6611 and 6618
   cm(-1) are measured at different pressures by using direct tunable diode
   laser absorption spectroscopy (dTDLAS) technique. The measurement
   procedure is repeated at least 10 times at each pressure, and then
   average value is calculated. Voigt fitting is used to obtain all line
   integral area, and then the line integral area is obtained by linear
   fitting. The slope of the fitting straight line equals line strength.
   Uncertainty analysis is given for the measurements. The measured
   linestrength is a function of integrated area, temperature, pressure,
   species mole fraction and effective path length. So, the calculated
   linestrength uncertainties based on those parameters uncertainties, and
   the uncertainties of pressure, species mole fraction and effective path
   length are similar for all transitions with Delta(P) = 0.25\%,
   Delta(chi) = 0.2\%, and Delta(L) = 0.4\%. The uncertainties of the
   integrated area and temperature are related to different lines, and
   their values come from the actual measurement. In the end, uncertainty
   propagation formula is used to calculate linestrength uncetainty.
   Uncertainties of our measured line strengths are in a 0.81\%-3.33\%
   range. Our measured line strength values are different from line
   strengths in the HITRAN 2012 database, and the deviations are in

 abstract = {Ammonia and its deuterated isotopologues probe physical conditions
in dense molecular cloud cores. The time-dependence of deuterium fractionation
and the relative abundances of different nuclear spin modifications are supposed
to provide a means of determining the evolutionary stages of these objects. Aims.
We aim to test the current understanding of spin-state chemistry of deuterated
species by determining the abundances and spin ratios of NH2D, NHD2 and ND3 in
a quiescent, dense cloud. Methods. Spectral lines of NH3, NH2D, NHD2, ND3 and N2D+
were observed towards a dense, starless core in Ophiuchus with the APEX, GBT
and IRAM 30-m telescopes. The observations were interpreted using a gas-grain
chemistry model combined with radiative transfer calculations. The chemistry model
distinguishes between the different nuclear spin states of light hydrogen molecules,
ammonia and their deuterated forms. Different desorption schemes can be considered.
Results. High deuterium fractionation ratios with NH2D/NH3 ~ 0.4, NHD2/ NH2D ~ 0.2
and ND3/ NHD2 ~ 0.06 are found in the core. The observed ortho/para ratios of NH2D
and NHD2 are close to the corresponding nuclear spin statistical weights. The
chemistry model can approximately reproduce the observed abundances, but consistently
predicts too low ortho/para-NH2D, and too large ortho/para-NHD2 ratios. The longevity
of N2H+ and NH3 in dense gas, which is prerequisite to their strong deuteration,
can be attributed to the chemical inertia of N2 on grain surfaces. Conclusions.
The discrepancies between the chemistry model and the observations are likely to
be caused by the fact that the model assumes complete scrambling in principal
gas-phase deuteration reactions of ammonia, which means that all the nuclei are
mixed in reactive collisions. If, instead, these reactions occur through proton
hop/hydrogen abstraction processes, statistical spin ratios are to be expected.
The present results suggest that while the deuteration of ammonia changes with
physical conditions and time, the nuclear spin ratios of ammonia isotopologues
do not probe the evolutionary stage of a cloud.},

 reservoir is locked up in ices such as NH3, NH4+ and OCN-. So far, ammonia
 has not been detected beyond the snowline in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We
 aim to find gas-phase ammonia in a protoplanetary disk and characterize its
 abundance with respect to water vapor. Methods. Using HIFI on the Herschel
 Space Observatory, we detected for the first time the ground-state rotational
 emission of ortho-NH3 in a protoplanetary disk around TW Hya. We used detailed
 models of the disk’s physical structure and the chemistry of ammonia and water
 to infer the amounts of gas-phase molecules of these species. We explored two
 radial distributions (extended across the disk and confined to <60 au like the
 millimeter-sized grains) and two vertical distributions (near the midplane and
 at intermediate heights above the midplane, where water is expected to photodesorb
 off icy grains) to describe the (unknown) location of the molecules. These
 distributions capture the effects of radial drift and vertical settling of
 ice-covered grains. Results. The NH310-00 line is detected simultaneously with
 H2O 110-101 at an antenna temperature of 15.3 mK in the Herschel beam; the same
 spectrum also contains the N2H+ 6-5 line with a strength of 18.1 mK. We use
 physical-chemical models to reproduce the fluxes and assume that water and ammonia
 are cospatial. We infer ammonia gas-phase masses of 0.7-11.0 × 1021 g, depending
 on the adopted spatial distribution, in line with previous literature estimates.
 For water, we infer gas-phase masses of 0.2-16.0 × 1022 g, improving upon earlier
 literature estimates This corresponds to NH3/H2O abundance ratios of 7%-84%,
 assuming that water and ammonia are co-located. The inferred N2H+ gas mass of
 4.9 × 1021 g agrees well with earlier literature estimates that were based on
 lower excitation transitions. These masses correspond to a disk-averaged abundances
 of 0.2-17.0 × 10-11, 0.1-9.0 × 10-10 and 7.6 × 10-11 for NH3, H2O and N2H+ respectively.
 Conclusions. Only in the most compact and settled adopted configuration is the
 inferred NH3/H2O consistent with interstellar ices and solar system bodies
 of ~5%-10%; all other spatial distributions require additional gas-phase NH3
 production mechanisms. Volatile release in the midplane may occur through collisions
 between icy bodies if the available surface for subsequent freeze-out is significantly
 reduced, for instance, through growth of small grains into pebbles or larger bodies.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2016},

pages = {A131},
Abstract = {Context. A discrepancy exists between the abundance of ammonia (NH3)
   derived previously for the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of IRC+10216
   from far-IR submillimeter rotational lines and that inferred from radio
   inversion or mid-infrared (MIR) absorption transitions.
   Aims. To address the discrepancy described above, new high-resolution
   far-infrared (FIR) observations of both ortho-and para-NH3 transitions
   toward IRC+10216 were obtained with Herschel, with the goal of
   determining the ammonia abundance and constraining the distribution of
   NH3 in the envelope of IRC+10216.
   Methods. We used the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI)
   on board Herschel to observe all rotational transitions up to the J = 3
   level (three ortho-and six para-NH3 lines). We conducted non-LTE
   multilevel radiative transfer modelling, including the effects of
   near-infrared (NIR) radiative pumping through vibrational transitions.
   The computed emission line profiles are compared with the new HIFI data,
   the radio inversion transitions, and the MIR absorption lines in the
   nu(2) band taken from the literature.
   Results. We found that NIR pumping is of key importance for
   understanding the excitation of rotational levels of NH3. The derived
   NH3 abundances relative to molecular hydrogen were (2.8 +/- 0.5) x
   10(-8) for ortho-NH3 and (3.2(-0.6)(+0.7)) x 10(-8) for para-NH3,
   consistent with an ortho/para ratio of 1. These values are in a rough
   agreement with abundances derived from the inversion transitions, as
   well as with the total abundance of NH3 inferred from the MIR absorption
   lines. To explain the observed rotational transitions, ammonia must be
   formed near to the central star at a radius close to the end of the wind
   acceleration region, but no larger than about 20 stellar radii (1 sigma
   confidence level).},

unapodized) Fourier-transform spectra of high purity (99.5\%) normal ammonia
sample obtained using the \{AILES\} beamline of Synchrotron SOLEIL. The experimental
conditions are designed to study numerous transitions with intensities weaker
than 1×10-22 cm1/(molecule⋅cm-2) at room temperatures. Line positions and intensities
of more than 2830 transitions of 14NH3 are measured and compiled after proper
quality control; the features from minor isotopologues (15NH3 and NH2D) and \{H2O\}
are identified and removed. Based on the predictions of recent work from the
empirical Hamiltonian modeling, systematic quantum assignments are made for 2047
transitions from eight bands including four inversion-rotation bands (gs, v2, 2v2, and v4)
and four ro-vibrational bands (v2 - gs, 2v2 - v2, v4 - v2, and 2v2 -v4), as well
as covering their ΔK = 3 forbidden transitions. The measured line positions for
the assigned transitions are in an excellent agreement (typically better than 0.001 cm-1)
with the predictions in a wide range of J and K for all the eight bands. The
comparison with the \{HITRAN\} 2012 database is also satisfactory, although
systematic offsets are seen for transitions with high J and K and those from
weak bands. Also we note that out of the 8 bands, the 2v2 - v4 has not been listed

Title = {{Near-infrared photometry of Y Dwarfs: Low ammonia abundance and the
   onset of water clouds}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {799},
pages = {37},
Abstract = {We present new near-infrared photometry for seven late-type T dwarfs and
   nine Y-type dwarfs, and lower limit magnitudes for a tenth Y dwarf,
   obtained at Gemini Observatory. We also present a reanalysis of H-band
   imaging data from the Keck Observatory Archive, for an 11th Y dwarf.
   These data are combined with earlier MKO-system photometry, Spitzer and
   WISE mid-infrared photometry, and available trigonometric parallaxes, to
   create a sample of late-type brown dwarfs that includes 10 T9-T9.5
   dwarfs or dwarf systems, and 16 Y dwarfs. We compare the data to our
   models, which include updated H-2 and NH3 opacity, as well as
   low-temperature condensate clouds. The models qualitatively reproduce
   the trends seen in the observed colors; however, there are discrepancies
   of around a factor of two in flux for the Y0-Y1 dwarfs, with T-eff
   approximate to 350-400 K. At T-eff similar to 400 K, the problems could
   be addressed by significantly reducing the NH3 absorption, for example
   by halving the abundance of NH3 possibly by vertical mixing. At T-eff
   similar to 350 K, the discrepancy may be resolved by incorporating thick
   water clouds. The onset of these clouds might occur over a narrow range
   in T-eff, as indicated by the observed small change in 5 mu m flux over
   a large change in J -W2 color. Of the known Y dwarfs, the reddest in
   J-W2 are WISEP J182831.08 + 265037.8 and WISE J085510.83-071442.5. We
   interpret the former as a pair of identical 300-350 K dwarfs, and the
   latter as a 250 K dwarf. If these objects are similar to 3 Gyr old,
   their masses are similar to 10 and similar to 5 Jupiter-masses,
   respectively.},

both saturation and molecular alignment of a gas sample owing to the rapid sweep
of the radiation through the absorption features. In the QC lasers used to study
the 14N and 15N isotopologues of the ν4 band of ammonia centered near 1625 cm-1,
the variation of the chirp rate during the scan is very large, from ca. 85 to ca.
15 MHz ns-1. In the rapid chirp zone the collisional interaction time of the
laser radiation with the gas molecules is short, and large rapid passage effects
are seen, whereas at the slow chirp end the line shape resembles that of a Doppler
broadened line. The total scan range of the QC laser of ca. 10 cm-1 is sufficient
to allow the spectra of both isotopologues to be recorded and the rapid and slow
interactions with the laser radiation to be seen. The rapid passage effects are
enhanced by the use of an off axis Herriott cell with an effective path length
of 62 m, which allows a buildup of polarization to occur. The effective resolution
of the chirped QC laser is ca. 0.012 cm-1 full width at half-maximum in the 1625
cm-1 region. The results of these experiments are compared with those of other
studies of the ν4 band of ammonia carried out using Fourier transform and Laser
Stark spectroscopy. They also demonstrate the versatility of the down chirped QC
laser for investigating collisional effects in low pressure gases using long

journal = ApJ,
volume = {777},
pages = {95},
year = {2013},
abstract={Super-Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency
and some will be able to retain stable H 2 -dominated atmospheres. We study
biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H 2 atmospheres and habitable surface
temperatures, using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate
framework for evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates.
We find that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species
in H 2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high CO 2 levels, atomic O is the major
destructive species for some molecules. In Sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments,
H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest.
The lower UV fluxes from UV-quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration
of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate.
The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulate detectable biosignature
gases in an H 2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres,
where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential
biosignature gases, such as dimethylsulfide and CH 3 Cl, are therefore more favorable
in low-UV, as compared with solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature
gas candidates, including NH 3 and N 2 O, are favorable even in solar-like UV
environments, as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O).
A more subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated
forms of an element, such as CH 4 and H 2 S, are not effective signs of life in
an H 2 -rich atmosphere because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate
such gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature
gases in H 2 -rich atmospheres for super-Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could
potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope},

Title = {{Rovibrational spectra of ammonia. {I.} Unprecedented accuracy of a
   potential energy surface used with nonadiabatic corrections}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
pages = {044320},
Abstract = {In this work, we build upon our previous work on the theoretical
   spectroscopy of ammonia, NH(3). Compared to our 2008 study, we include
   more physics in our rovibrational calculations and more experimental
   data in the refinement procedure, and these enable us to produce a
   potential energy surface (PES) of unprecedented accuracy. We call this
   the HSL-2 PES. The additional physics we include is a second-order
   correction for the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and
   we find it to be critical for improved results. By including
   experimental data for higher rotational levels in the refinement
   procedure, we were able to greatly reduce our systematic errors for the
   rotational dependence of our predictions. These additions together lead
   to a significantly improved total angular momentum (J) dependence in our
   computed rovibrational energies. The root-mean-square error between our
   predictions using the HSL-2 PES and the reliable energy levels from the
   HITRAN database for J = 0-6 and J = 7/8 for (14)NH(3) is only 0.015
   cm(-1) and 0.020/0.023 cm(-1), respectively. The root-mean-square errors
   for the characteristic inversion splittings are approximately 1/3
   smaller than those for energy levels. The root-mean-square error for the
   6002 J = 0-8 transition energies is 0.020 cm(-1). Overall, for J = 0-8,
   the spectroscopic data computed with HSL-2 is roughly an order of
   magnitude more accurate relative to our previous best ammonia PES
   (denoted HSL-1). These impressive numbers are eclipsed only by the
   root-mean-square error between our predictions for purely rotational
   transition energies of (15)NH(3) and the highly accurate Cologne
   database (CDMS): 0.00034 cm(-1) (10 MHz), in other words, 2 orders of
   magnitude smaller. In addition, we identify a deficiency in the
   (15)NH(3) energy levels determined from a model of the experimental
   data.},

Abstract = {Several aspects of ammonia rovibrational spectra have been investigated
   using the new HSL-2 potential energy surface that includes an
   approximate correction for nonadiabatic effects. The unprecdented
   accuracy of rovibrational energy levels and transition energies computed
   using HSL-2 was demonstrated in Part I of this study. For (NH3)-N-14,
   new assignments for a few nu(3) + nu(4) band transitions and energy
   levels are suggested, and discrepancies between computed and HITRAN
   energy levels in the 2 nu(4) band are analyzed (2 nu(4) is the most
   difficult band below 5000 cm (1)). New assignments are suggested for
   existing or missing 2 nu(4) levels. Several new vibrational bands are
   identified from existing, unassigned HITRAN data, including 2 nu(2) +
   nu(4), (nu(3) + nu(4)) -A'/A `', nu(1) + 2 nu(2), and 2 nu(2) + 2 nu(4).
   The strong mixing between the 2 nu(4) and 2 nu(2) + nu(4) bands is
   carefully examined and found to be the source of the difficulties in the
   experimental modeling of 2 nu(4). Discussion is presented for
   preliminary J = 10 results, where the overall root-mean-square error is
   estimated to be less than 0.039 cm(-1). The analysis of the 4 nu(2) band
   demonstrates both the reliability and the accuracy of predictions from
   HSL-2. The full list of computed J = 0 band origins (with assignments)
   and the inversion splittings up to 7000-8000 cm(-1) above the zero-point
   energy are presented. J = 0-2 levels are reported for those bands below
   5100 cm(-1) that are missing from the HITRAN database. For (NH3)-N-15,
   excellent agreement is found for the available nu(2) and nu(3) +
   nu(4)(E) transition energies, but significant deficiencies are shown for
   HITRAN levels and several corrections are suggested. The N-15 isotopic
   effects are presented for the J = 0-6 levels of 13 HITRAN bands. For
   (ND3)-N-14, we reproduce the pure rotational inversion spectra line
   frequencies with an accuracy similar to that for (NH3)-N-14. However, it
   is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all four pairs of
   inversion-split vibrational fundamentals to better than 0.05 cm(-1)
   uncertainty. It is suggested that a reanalysis of some suspicious
   (ND3)-N-14 fundamental bands is required. The analyses presented here
   and in Part I show that rovibrational energy levels and transition
   frequencies computed with HSL-2 (with nonadiabatic corrections) remain
   highly accurate well beyond the experimental data used in the refinement
   procedure. Calculations using HSL-2 are capable of revealing many
   deficiencies in experimental analyses of ammonia spectra and provide
   reliable predictions with similar accuracy. It is expected that the
   results of this study will be useful in the future interpretation of
   high-resolution spectra from laboratory experiments or from astronomical
   observations. The present work represents a very significant advance in
   the state of our knowledge of the spectroscopy of ammonia and its
   isotopologues.},

Abstract = {Eleven instruments for the measurement of ambient concentrations of
   atmospheric ammonia gas (NH(3)), based on eight different measurement
   methods were inter-compared above an intensively managed agricultural
   field in late summer 2008 in Southern Scotland. To test the instruments
   over a wide range of concentrations, the field was fertilised with urea
   midway through the experiment, leading to an increase in the average
   concentration from 10 to 100 ppbv. The instruments deployed included
   three wet-chemistry systems, one with offline analysis (annular rotating
   batch denuder, RBD) and two with online-analysis (Annular Denuder
   sampling with online Analysis, AMANDA; AiRRmonia), two Quantum Cascade
   Laser Absorption Spectrometers (a large-cell dual system; DUAL-QCLAS,
   and a compact system; c-QCLAS), two photo-acoustic spectrometers
   (WaSul-Flux; Nitrolux-100), a Cavity Ring Down Spectrosmeter (CRDS), a
   Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), an ion mobility
   spectrometer (IMS) and an OpenPath Fourier Transform Infra-Red (OP-FTIR)
   Spectrometer. The instruments were compared with each other and with the
   average concentration of all instruments. An overall good agreement of
   hourly average concentrations between the instruments (R(2)>0.84), was
   observed for NH(3) concentrations at the field of up to 120 ppbv with
   the slopes against the average ranging from 0.67 (DUAL-QCLAS) to 1.13
   (AiRRmonia) with intercepts of -0.74 ppbv (RBD) to + 2.69 ppbv (CIMS).
   More variability was found for performance for lower concentrations(<10
   ppbv). Here the main factors affecting measurement precision are (a) the
   inlet design, (b) the state of inlet filters (where applicable), and (c)
   the quality of gas-phase standards (where applicable). By reference to
   the fast (1 Hz) instruments deployed during the study, it was possible
   to characterize the response times of the slower instruments.},

pages = {174317},
abstract = {Complete and reliable knowledge of the ammonia spectrum is needed to
enable the analysis and interpretation of astrophysical and planetary observations.
Ammonia has been observed in the interstellar medium up to J = 18 and more highly
excited transitions are expected to appear in hot exoplanets and brown dwarfs.
As a result, there is considerable interest in observing and assigning the high J
(rovibrational) spectrum. In this work, numerous spectroscopic techniques were
employed to study its high J transitions in the ground and nu(2) = 1 states.
Measurements were carried out using a frequency multiplied submillimeter spectrometer
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a tunable far-infrared spectrometer at University
of Toyama, and a high-resolution Bruker IFS 125 Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS)
at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Highly excited ammonia was created with a radiofrequency
discharge and a dc discharge, which allowed assignments of transitions with J up
to 35. One hundred and seventy seven ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion transitions
were observed with microwave accuracy in the 0.3-4.7 THz region. Of these, 125 were
observed for the first time, including 26 Delta K = 3 transitions. Over 2000
far-infrared transitions were assigned to the ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion
bands as well as the nu(2) fundamental band. Of these, 1912 were assigned using the
FTS data for the first time, including 222 Delta K = 3 transitions. The accuracy
of these measurements has been estimated to be 0.0003-0.0006 cm(-1). A reduced root
mean square error of 0.9 was obtained for a global fit of the ground and nu(2) = 1
states, which includes the lines assigned in this work and all previously available
microwave, terahertz, far-infrared, and mid-infrared data. The new measurements and
predictions reported here will support the analyses of astronomical observations
by high-resolution spectroscopy telescopes such as Herschel, SOFIA, and ALMA. The
comprehensive experimental rovibrational energy levels reported here will permit
further refinement of the potential energy surface to improve ammonia ab initio
calculations and facilitate assignment of new high-resolution spectra of hot ammonia.},

Abstract = {We present a new model for the rotation-vibration motion of pyramidal

   treated as a large-amplitude motion, while the small-amplitude
   vibrations are described by linearized stretching and bending
   coordinates. The rotation-vibration Schrodinger equation is solved
   variationally. We report three applications of the model to (NH3)-N-14
   using an analytic potential function derived from high-level ab initio
   calculations. These applications address the J = 0 vibrational energies
   up to 6100 cm, the J less than or equal to 2 energies for the
   vibrational ground state and the nu(2), nu(4), and 2nu(2) excited
   vibrational states, and the J less than or equal to 7 energies for the
   4nu(2)(+) vibrational state. We demonstrate that also for four-atomic
   molecules, theoretical calculations of rotation-vibration energies can
   be helpful in the interpretation and assignment of experimental,
   high-resolution rotation vibration spectra. Our approach incorporates an
   optimum inherent separation of different types of nuclear motion and

Abstract = {In the present work, we study the vibrational spectrum of ammonia in
   full dimensionality (6D), with special emphasis on the tunneling
   splitting. The inversion motion, i.e., the active mode v(2), is indeed
   relatively well decoupled from the other five inactive modes. Therefore,
   an adiabatic separation in an active wave function and an inactive one,
   approximated with a 5D-harmonic basis function, is certainly well
   adapted to describing this motion. This separation leads to several
   1D-effective Hamiltonians for each 5D-harmonic basis function or
   adiabatic channel. Two models have been tested: the harmonic adiabatic
   approximation (HADA), when only one channel is used and the coupled HADA
   (cHADA), when several channels are coupled.
   In order to get reliable values for tunneling splitting, our
   calculations have shown that: (i) the calculation of the electronic
   potential has to be performed with a large atomic basis set (up to
   quintuple zeta) with a method including core-valence correlation; (ii)
   the cHADA is required since the HADA overestimates the energy levels.
   Furthermore, our values for the tunneling splitting are in good
   agreement with the experimental data of ammonia and several isotopomers.},

   extrapolated to the infinite basis set limit. Core-valence and first
   order relativistic effects are also included. The influence of these two
   contributions and basis set sizes on both the inversion barrier height
   and equilibrium geometry are investigated thoroughly. The same methods
   are also adopted for ammonia in order to further improve a recently
   published surface {[}J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6358 (2003)]. The vibrational
   eigenvalues are calculated variationally both for the symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers using exact six-dimensional kinetic energy
   operators and successive basis set contractions. With the new surfaces,
   the mean absolute deviations obtained for all experimentally observed
   inversion splittings for different isotopomers of H(3)O(+) (8 states)
   and (14)NH(3) (17 states) are 0.78 and 0.25 cm(-1), respectively.
   Inversion levels are calculated with almost similar accuracy. These
   results indicate that the calculated inversion barrier heights for
   H(3)O(+) and NH(3), 650 and 1792 cm(-1), respectively, are close to the
   real values. The value for ammonia is also close to the height
   determined from published experimental data in our previous work. The
   lowest energies for the high-frequency modes are computed with the mean
   absolute deviation being less than 2 cm(-1) for isotopomers of H(3)O(+)
   and less than 4.5 cm(-1) for (14)NH(3) with respect to experimental
   energies. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

Title = {{Vibrational energy levels for symmetric and asymmetric isotopomers of
   ammonia with an exact kinetic energy operator and new potential energy
   surfaces}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2003},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {6358-6369},
Abstract = {A new vibrational Hamiltonian operator for ammonia is presented. The
   potential energy part is expressed in terms of symmetrized bond-angle
   valence coordinates and an inversion coordinate, which is a function of
   the bond angles. In the exact kinetic energy operator, the stretching
   part is instead given in terms of unsymmetrized bond displacement
   coordinates. Six-dimensional ammonia potential energy surfaces are
   calculated using high-level ab initio tools, the CCSD(T) method with
   aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The potential energy functions
   are constructed in two, two-dimensional steps. The surfaces are
   expressed as a Taylor-type series with respect to the doubly degenerate
   asymmetric stretching and bending coordinates. This representation is
   given along a two-dimensional surface of the totally symmetric
   stretching and inversion coordinates of ammonia. Vibrational energies
   are calculated variationally in a finite basis representation. Employing
   successive basis set contractions, it is possible to optimize some
   potential energy parameters simultaneously for seven symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers very effectively. The symmetric part of the
   surface is fitted to experimentally observed vibrational band centers up
   to 6000 cm(-1). This reduces the mean absolute error from 7.84 cm(-1)
   with a pure ab initio potential to 0.44 cm(-1) compared to the
   experimental values for (14)NH(3). In addition, vibrational energy
   levels of (14)NH(3) have been calculated up to about 15 000 cm(-1) using
   the pure ab initio surface obtained with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The
   nuclear motion calculation converges all levels up to about 10 000
   cm(-1) to within 0.05 cm(-1).},

The second uses the code \{MULTIMODE\} (J. Chem. Phys. 107 (1997) 10458), which
involves the kinetic energy operator as expressed in normal coordinates by Watson.
The third uses an implementation of the reaction path hamiltonian (J. Chem. Phys. 72 (1980) 99)

        and 1260 in lower symmetry), more accurate energies (CBS+) were obtained
        by extrapolating the CCSD(T) results for the aug-cc-pVXZ (X=T,Q,5)

Abstract = {A new inversion coordinate is defined for ammonia as a function of the

   symmetric bending displacement coordinate for the pyramidal XY3-type
   molecules. We have used this in a two-dimensional calculation including
   the totally symmetric stretching and the inversion mode. A conventional
   symmetrized internal coordinate is employed for the symmetric stretch. A
   two-dimensional potential energy surface is calculated using the ab
   initio CCSD(T) method together with the aug-cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ, and
   aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. The corresponding eigenvalues are calculated
   variationally using a Morse oscillator basis set for the stretch and a

hampered by the scarcity of reliable line data for methane and ammonia which both

band models which are based upon the laboratory measurement of the transmission
spectra of the gases under conditions similar to those found in planetary atmospheres
must be used. This has been done extensively for methane by previous investigators
but analysis of the ammonia spectrum is more difficult due to the corrosive nature
of this gas. Furthermore ammonia at the pressures and cold temperatures found in
the gas giant atmospheres is close to condensation. However there is increased
interest in the spectroscopy of ammonia as a result of the success of the Galileo
mission, and we present here measurements and analysis of ammonia transmission
spectra originally measured in 1984 but never previously published until now.
These data have been fitted with band models and k-distribution models and we
present the results of both these analyses. The data set uniquely covers the
near-infrared range vital for the analysis of data from the Galileo near-infrared
mapping spectrometer (NIMS) instrument and hence until further measurements can
be made, these are the best and only data that exist to analyse ammonia in the
near infrared spectra of the gaseous planets.},

Abstract = {We report experimental line positions and intensities of the 3 nu(2) and
   nu(2) + nu(4) bands of (NH3)-N-14 obtained from 0.011 cm(-1) unapodized
   resolution spectra recorded with the Fourier transform spectrometer at
   Kitt Peak National Observatory, A total of 1366 lines with J' less than
   or equal to 13 have been assigned from which 1213 line positions with J'
   less than or equal to 12 are fitted. using an effective
   rotation-inversion Hamiltonian to achieve a rms of 0.0069 cm(-1); 726
   intensity measurements are modeled to 12 terms of dipole moment
   expansion to +/-6\%. The band strengths of 3 nu(2) (s - a) at 2384.15
   cm(-1), of 3 nu(2) (a - s) at 2895.52 cm(-1), of nu(2) + nu(4) (s - s)
   at 2540.53 cm(-1), and of nu(2) + nu(4) (a - a) at 2586.13 cm(-1) are
   estimated to be 0.61(3), 0.244(7), 0.186(3) and 0.174(25) cm(-2)
   atm(-1), respectively, at 296 K. In addition to the 3 nu(2)/nu(2) +
   nu(4) system, there are a number of strong lines that are thought to
   belong to hot bands. A prediction of the line positions and intensities
   has been generated for all lines with intensities greater than 0.1 X
   10(-6) cm(-2) atm(-1) at 296 K and submitted to the HITRAN database.
   Implications about the suitability of the Hamiltonian used are explored,
   given that the experimental accuracy is about 16 times better than has
   been achieved by the fit.},

correcting for Fermi resonance, the computed fundamentals and ν4 overtones agree
on average to better than 3 cm-1 with the experimental ones except for ν2. The
discrepancy for ν2 is principally due to higher‐order anharmonicity effects. The
computed ω1, ω3, and ω4 confirm the recent experimental determination by Lehmann
and Coy but are associated with smaller error bars. The discrepancy between the
computed and experimental ω2 is far outside the expected error range, which is
also attributed to higher‐order anharmonicity effects not accounted for in the
experimental determination. Spectroscopic constants are predicted for a number
of symmetric and asymmetric top isotopomers of NH3.},

These values were determined in a high-purity shock tube, either by measuring excimer pulse fractional absorptions or by measuring photolysis-product yields. Correlations between absorption coefficients and vibrational populations of the absorbing species are discussed. Using these absorption coefficients, a prediction can be made of the amount of O, NH2, OH, and H produced in shock-tube excimer-photolysis experiments. This direct production of radicals is attractive for reaction-kinetics studies in high-temperature gases."

 in time over a 3-yr period. Two weak, unidentified absorptions were discovered
 in the red region of Titan's spectrum, in the absence of any detectable ammonia.

journal = PR,
year = {1932},
volume = {41},
pages = {313},
abstract = {The system of a particle moving in a potential field containing two
equal minima is treated by the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method of approximation.
The energy levels are grouped in pairs and the object of the computation is to find
the separation between two levels forming a pair. This is accomplished by connecting
the oscillatory and exponential approximate solutions of the wave equation by means
of the Kramers connection formulae. If Δ is the separation of a pair and hν the
distance between two pairs Δhν=1πA2 where A=exp[(2πh)∫0x1[2m(V-E)]12dx]. A particular
potential curve is chosen consisting of two equal parabolae connected by a straight line.
The expression for Δ may then be evaluated explicitly as a function of the length
of the joining line, 2(x0-α) and the distance between two minima, 2x0. These formulae
may be applied to determining the form of the ammonia molecule. Substituting the
experimental values for Δ0 and Δ1, it is found that x0=3.161 and α=1.916. An exact
solution for this particular potential curve may be found by joining Weber's
function Dn(x-x0) and Dn(x+x0) to a hyperbolic sine or cosine. This process also
leads to expressions for Δ which may be equated to the experimental values
yielding x0=3.182 and α=1.930, in good agreement with the earlier determination.
Finally x0 is used to compute 2q0=0.760×10-8 cm, the distance between the two
potential minima, and the following dimensions of the ammonia molecule, H - H = 1.64×10-8,
N - H = 1.02×10-8 cm.},

  abstract = {A large number of lines in the solar spectrum previously unidentified have been attributed to ammonia by Fowler and Gregory. Their investigation however, referred only to the characteristic ultra-violet band with its centre at about {$\lambda$} 3360, and it seemed desirable to continue the inquiry, in order to determine whether other bands associated with ammonia are also represented in the solar spectrum. One of the bands, in the yellow-green part of the spectrum, about {$\lambda$} 5635, was first observed in vacuum tubes by Schuster, and has since been found to consist of two adjacent bands. Besides this, there is an extended band spectrum ranging through the greater part of the visible region, which appears in the greater part of the visible region, which appears in the flame in the flame of ammonia burning in oxygen, and has been called the "{$\alpha$}-band" by Eder and Valenta.},
