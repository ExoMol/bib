Title = {{Analysis of gaseous ammonia (NH3) absorption in the visible spectrum of
   Jupiter}},
Journal = {{Icarus}},

Pages = {426-436},
Abstract = {{Observations of the visible/near-infrared reflectance spectrum of
   Jupiter have been made with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi Unit
   Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument in the spectral range 0.480.93
   mu m in support of the NASA/Juno mission. These spectra contain spectral
   signatures of gaseous ammonia (NH3), whose abundance above the cloud
   tops can be determined if we have reliable information on its absorption
   spectrum. While there are a number of sources of NH3 absorption data in
   this spectral range, they cover small sub-ranges, which do not
   necessarily overlap and have been determined from a variety of sources.
   There is thus considerable uncertainty regarding the consistency of
   these different sources when modelling the reflectance of the entire
   visible/near-IR range. In this paper we analyse the VLT/MUSE
   observations of Jupiter to determine which sources of ammonia absorption
   data are most reliable. We find that the band model coefficients of
   Bowles et al. (2008) provide, in general, the best combination of
   reliability and wavelength coverage over the MUSE range. These band data
   appear consistent with ExoMOL ammonia line data of Yurchenko et al.
   (2011), at wavelengths where they overlap, but these latter data do not
   cover the ammonia absorption bands at 0.79 and 0.765 mu m, which are
   prominent in our MUSE observations. However, we find the band data of
   Bowles et al. (2008) are not reliable at wavelengths less than 0.758 mu
   m. At shorter wavelengths we find the laboratory observations of Lutz
   and Owen (1980) provide a good indication of the position and shape of
   the ammonia absorptions near 0.552 mu m and 0.648 mu m, but their
   absorption strengths appear inconsistent with the band data of Bowles et
   al. (2008) at longer wavelengths. Finally, we find that the line data of
   the 0.648 mu m absorption band of Giver et al. (1975) are not suitable
   for modelling these data as they account for only 17\% of the band
   absorption and cannot be extended reliably to the cold temperatures and
   H-2/He-broadening conditions found in Jupiter's atmosphere. This work is
   of significance not only for solar system planetary physics, but also
   for future proposed observations of Jupiter-like planets orbiting other
   stars, such as with NASA's planned Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope
   (WFIRST). .}},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{469}},
Pages = {1979-1996},
Abstract = {{Interpretations of exoplanetary transmission spectra have been
   undermined by apparent obscuration due to clouds/hazes. Debate rages on
   whether weak H2O features seen in exoplanet spectra are due to clouds or
   inherently depleted oxygen. Assertions of solar H2O abundances have
   relied on making a priori model assumptions, for example,
   chemical/radiative equilibrium. In this work, we attempt to address this
   problem with a new retrieval paradigm for transmission spectra. We
   introduce POSEIDON, a two-dimensional atmospheric retrieval algorithm
   including generalized inhomogeneous clouds. We demonstrate that this
   prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and
   prominent molecular abundances. We apply POSEIDON to the best
   transmission spectrum presently available, for the hot Jupiter HD
   209458b, uncovering new insights into its atmosphere at the day-night
   terminator. We extensively explore the parameter space with an
   unprecedented 108 models, spanning the continuum from fully cloudy to
   cloud-free atmospheres, in a fully Bayesian retrieval framework. We
   report the first detection of nitrogen chemistry (NH3 and/or HCN) in an
   exoplanet atmosphere at 3.7-7.7 sigma confidence, non-uniform cloud
   coverage at 4.5-5.4 sigma, high-altitude hazes at > 3 sigma and
   sub-solar H2O at greater than or similar to 3-5 sigma, depending on the
   assumed cloud distribution. We detect NH3 at 3.3 sigma, and 4.9 sigma
   for fully cloudy and cloud-free scenarios, respectively. For the model
   with the highest Bayesian evidence, we constrain H2O at 5-15 ppm
   (0.01-0.03) x solar and NH3 at 0.01-2.7 ppm, strongly suggesting
   disequilibrium chemistry and cautioning against equilibrium assumptions.
   Our results herald a new promise for retrieving cloudy atmospheres using
   high-precision Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope

This study analyzes high-resolution (0.00167 cm-1, unapodized) Fourier-transform spectra of high purity (99.5\%) normal ammonia sample obtained using the \{AILES\} beamline of Synchrotron SOLEIL. The experimental conditions are designed to study numerous transitions with intensities weaker than 1×10-22 cm1/(molecule⋅cm-2) at room temperatures. Line positions and intensities of more than 2830 transitions of 14NH3 are measured and compiled after proper quality control; the features from minor isotopologues (15NH3 and NH2D) and \{H2O\} are identified and removed. Based on the predictions of recent work from the empirical Hamiltonian modeling, systematic quantum assignments are made for 2047 transitions from eight bands including four inversion-rotation bands (gs, v2, 2v2, and v4) and four ro-vibrational bands (v2 – gs, 2v2 – v2, v4 – v2, and 2v2 –v4), as well as covering their ΔK = 3 forbidden transitions. The measured line positions for the assigned transitions are in an excellent agreement (typically better than 0.001 cm-1) with the predictions in a wide range of J and K for all the eight bands. The comparison with the \{HITRAN\} 2012 database is also satisfactory, although systematic offsets are seen for transitions with high J and K and those from weak bands. Also we note that out of the 8 bands, the 2v2 – v4 has not been listed in the \{HITRAN\} 2012 database. Differences of 20\% are seen between our measured and calculated intensities depending on the bands. For line positions, greater differences are found for some \{NH3\} bands in \{HITRAN\} 2012 than recent predictions. Measurements of the individual line positions and intensities are presented for eight bands, and the final spectroscopic line positions and intensities are compiled as an electronic supplement. "

Abstract = {{Eleven instruments for the measurement of ambient concentrations of
   atmospheric ammonia gas (NH(3)), based on eight different measurement
   methods were inter-compared above an intensively managed agricultural
   field in late summer 2008 in Southern Scotland. To test the instruments
   over a wide range of concentrations, the field was fertilised with urea
   midway through the experiment, leading to an increase in the average
   concentration from 10 to 100 ppbv. The instruments deployed included
   three wet-chemistry systems, one with offline analysis (annular rotating
   batch denuder, RBD) and two with online-analysis (Annular Denuder
   sampling with online Analysis, AMANDA; AiRRmonia), two Quantum Cascade
   Laser Absorption Spectrometers (a large-cell dual system; DUAL-QCLAS,
   and a compact system; c-QCLAS), two photo-acoustic spectrometers
   (WaSul-Flux; Nitrolux-100), a Cavity Ring Down Spectrosmeter (CRDS), a
   Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), an ion mobility
   spectrometer (IMS) and an OpenPath Fourier Transform Infra-Red (OP-FTIR)
   Spectrometer. The instruments were compared with each other and with the
   average concentration of all instruments. An overall good agreement of
   hourly average concentrations between the instruments (R(2)>0.84), was
   observed for NH(3) concentrations at the field of up to 120 ppbv with
   the slopes against the average ranging from 0.67 (DUAL-QCLAS) to 1.13
   (AiRRmonia) with intercepts of -0.74 ppbv (RBD) to + 2.69 ppbv (CIMS).
   More variability was found for performance for lower concentrations(<10
   ppbv). Here the main factors affecting measurement precision are (a) the
   inlet design, (b) the state of inlet filters (where applicable), and (c)
   the quality of gas-phase standards (where applicable). By reference to
   the fast (1 Hz) instruments deployed during the study, it was possible
   to characterize the response times of the slower instruments.}},

Abstract = {{We present new near-infrared photometry for seven late-type T dwarfs and
   nine Y-type dwarfs, and lower limit magnitudes for a tenth Y dwarf,
   obtained at Gemini Observatory. We also present a reanalysis of H-band
   imaging data from the Keck Observatory Archive, for an 11th Y dwarf.
   These data are combined with earlier MKO-system photometry, Spitzer and
   WISE mid-infrared photometry, and available trigonometric parallaxes, to
   create a sample of late-type brown dwarfs that includes 10 T9-T9.5
   dwarfs or dwarf systems, and 16 Y dwarfs. We compare the data to our
   models, which include updated H-2 and NH3 opacity, as well as
   low-temperature condensate clouds. The models qualitatively reproduce
   the trends seen in the observed colors; however, there are discrepancies
   of around a factor of two in flux for the Y0-Y1 dwarfs, with T-eff
   approximate to 350-400 K. At T-eff similar to 400 K, the problems could
   be addressed by significantly reducing the NH3 absorption, for example
   by halving the abundance of NH3 possibly by vertical mixing. At T-eff
   similar to 350 K, the discrepancy may be resolved by incorporating thick
   water clouds. The onset of these clouds might occur over a narrow range
   in T-eff, as indicated by the observed small change in 5 mu m flux over
   a large change in J -W2 color. Of the known Y dwarfs, the reddest in
   J-W2 are WISEP J182831.08 + 265037.8 and WISE J085510.83-071442.5. We
   interpret the former as a pair of identical 300-350 K dwarfs, and the
   latter as a 250 K dwarf. If these objects are similar to 3 Gyr old,
   their masses are similar to 10 and similar to 5 Jupiter-masses,

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
Abstract = {In this work, we build upon our previous work on the theoretical
   spectroscopy of ammonia, NH(3). Compared to our 2008 study, we include
   more physics in our rovibrational calculations and more experimental
   data in the refinement procedure, and these enable us to produce a
   potential energy surface (PES) of unprecedented accuracy. We call this
   the HSL-2 PES. The additional physics we include is a second-order
   correction for the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and
   we find it to be critical for improved results. By including
   experimental data for higher rotational levels in the refinement
   procedure, we were able to greatly reduce our systematic errors for the
   rotational dependence of our predictions. These additions together lead
   to a significantly improved total angular momentum (J) dependence in our

   predictions using the HSL-2 PES and the reliable energy levels from the
   HITRAN database for J = 0-6 and J = 7/8 for (14)NH(3) is only 0.015
   cm(-1) and 0.020/0.023 cm(-1), respectively. The root-mean-square errors
   for the characteristic inversion splittings are approximately 1/3
   smaller than those for energy levels. The root-mean-square error for the
   6002 J = 0-8 transition energies is 0.020 cm(-1). Overall, for J = 0-8,
   the spectroscopic data computed with HSL-2 is roughly an order of
   magnitude more accurate relative to our previous best ammonia PES
   (denoted HSL-1). These impressive numbers are eclipsed only by the
   root-mean-square error between our predictions for purely rotational
   transition energies of (15)NH(3) and the highly accurate Cologne
   database (CDMS): 0.00034 cm(-1) (10 MHz), in other words, 2 orders of
   magnitude smaller. In addition, we identify a deficiency in the
   (15)NH(3) energy levels determined from a model of the experimental
   data. },

Abstract = {Several aspects of ammonia rovibrational spectra have been investigated
   using the new HSL-2 potential energy surface that includes an
   approximate correction for nonadiabatic effects. The unprecdented
   accuracy of rovibrational energy levels and transition energies computed
   using HSL-2 was demonstrated in Part I of this study. For (NH3)-N-14,
   new assignments for a few nu(3) + nu(4) band transitions and energy
   levels are suggested, and discrepancies between computed and HITRAN
   energy levels in the 2 nu(4) band are analyzed (2 nu(4) is the most
   difficult band below 5000 cm (1)). New assignments are suggested for
   existing or missing 2 nu(4) levels. Several new vibrational bands are
   identified from existing, unassigned HITRAN data, including 2 nu(2) +
   nu(4), (nu(3) + nu(4)) -A'/A `', nu(1) + 2 nu(2), and 2 nu(2) + 2 nu(4).
   The strong mixing between the 2 nu(4) and 2 nu(2) + nu(4) bands is
   carefully examined and found to be the source of the difficulties in the
   experimental modeling of 2 nu(4). Discussion is presented for
   preliminary J = 10 results, where the overall root-mean-square error is
   estimated to be less than 0.039 cm(-1). The analysis of the 4 nu(2) band
   demonstrates both the reliability and the accuracy of predictions from
   HSL-2. The full list of computed J = 0 band origins (with assignments)
   and the inversion splittings up to 7000-8000 cm(-1) above the zero-point
   energy are presented. J = 0-2 levels are reported for those bands below
   5100 cm(-1) that are missing from the HITRAN database. For (NH3)-N-15,
   excellent agreement is found for the available nu(2) and nu(3) +
   nu(4)(E) transition energies, but significant deficiencies are shown for
   HITRAN levels and several corrections are suggested. The N-15 isotopic
   effects are presented for the J = 0-6 levels of 13 HITRAN bands. For
   (ND3)-N-14, we reproduce the pure rotational inversion spectra line
   frequencies with an accuracy similar to that for (NH3)-N-14. However, it
   is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all four pairs of
   inversion-split vibrational fundamentals to better than 0.05 cm(-1)
   uncertainty. It is suggested that a reanalysis of some suspicious
   (ND3)-N-14 fundamental bands is required. The analyses presented here
   and in Part I show that rovibrational energy levels and transition
   frequencies computed with HSL-2 (with nonadiabatic corrections) remain
   highly accurate well beyond the experimental data used in the refinement
   procedure. Calculations using HSL-2 are capable of revealing many
   deficiencies in experimental analyses of ammonia spectra and provide
   reliable predictions with similar accuracy. It is expected that the
   results of this study will be useful in the future interpretation of
   high-resolution spectra from laboratory experiments or from astronomical
   observations. The present work represents a very significant advance in
   the state of our knowledge of the spectroscopy of ammonia and its
   isotopologues.},

 abstreact = {Complete and reliable knowledge of the ammonia spectrum is needed to enable the analysis and interpretation of astrophysical and planetary observations. Ammonia has been observed in the interstellar medium up to J = 18 and more highly excited transitions are expected to appear in hot exoplanets and brown dwarfs. As a result, there is considerable interest in observing and assigning the high J (rovibrational) spectrum. In this work, numerous spectroscopic techniques were employed to study its high J transitions in the ground and nu(2) = 1 states. Measurements were carried out using a frequency multiplied submillimeter spectrometer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a tunable far-infrared spectrometer at University of Toyama, and a high-resolution Bruker IFS 125 Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Highly excited ammonia was created with a radiofrequency discharge and a dc discharge, which allowed assignments of transitions with J up to 35. One hundred and seventy seven ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion transitions were observed with microwave accuracy in the 0.3-4.7 THz region. Of these, 125 were observed for the first time, including 26 Delta K = 3 transitions. Over 2000 far-infrared transitions were assigned to the ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion bands as well as the nu(2) fundamental band. Of these, 1912 were assigned using the FTS data for the first time, including 222 Delta K = 3 transitions. The accuracy of these measurements has been estimated to be 0.0003-0.0006 cm(-1). A reduced root mean square error of 0.9 was obtained for a global fit of the ground and nu(2) = 1 states, which includes the lines assigned in this work and all previously available microwave, terahertz, far-infrared, and mid-infrared data. The new measurements and predictions reported here will support the analyses of astronomical observations by high-resolution spectroscopy telescopes such as Herschel, SOFIA, and ALMA. The comprehensive experimental rovibrational energy levels reported here will permit further refinement of the potential energy surface to improve ammonia ab initio calculations and facilitate assignment of new high-resolution spectra of hot ammonia.},

   employed together with the variational nuclear motion code GENIUSH (J.

abstract = { Intrapulse quantum cascade (QC) laser spectrometers are able to produce both saturation and molecular alignment of a gas sample owing to the rapid sweep of the radiation through the absorption features. In the QC lasers used to study the 14N and 15N isotopologues of the ν4 band of ammonia centered near 1625 cm–1, the variation of the chirp rate during the scan is very large, from ca. 85 to ca. 15 MHz ns–1. In the rapid chirp zone the collisional interaction time of the laser radiation with the gas molecules is short, and large rapid passage effects are seen, whereas at the slow chirp end the line shape resembles that of a Doppler broadened line. The total scan range of the QC laser of ca. 10 cm–1 is sufficient to allow the spectra of both isotopologues to be recorded and the rapid and slow interactions with the laser radiation to be seen. The rapid passage effects are enhanced by the use of an off axis Herriott cell with an effective path length of 62 m, which allows a buildup of polarization to occur. The effective resolution of the chirped QC laser is ca. 0.012 cm–1 full width at half-maximum in the 1625 cm–1 region. The results of these experiments are compared with those of other studies of the ν4 band of ammonia carried out using Fourier transform and Laser Stark spectroscopy. They also demonstrate the versatility of the down chirped QC laser for investigating collisional effects in low pressure gases using long absorbing path lengths. }

Abstract = {We developed full cascade fluorescence models for NH3, HCN and HNC, and
   a new band model for the nu(1) ro-vibrational band of HC3N. The models
   are based on ab-initio spectral databases containing millions of
   spectral lines and also include extremely precise spectral information
   contained in several high-resolution spectral databases. Using these new
   models we derive detailed cascade maps for these species, and obtain
   realistic fluorescence efficiencies applicable to high-resolution
   infrared spectra. The new models permit accurate synthesis of
   line-by-line spectra for a wide range of rotational temperatures. We
   validated the models by comparing simulated emissions of these nitrogen
   species with measured spectra of comet C/2007 W1 (Boattini) acquired
   with high-resolution infrared spectrometers at high altitude sites. The
   new models accurately describe the complex emission spectrum, providing
   distinct rotational temperatures and production rates at greatly
   improved accuracy compared with results derived from earlier
   fluorescence models. In addition, we made use of the completeness and
   scope of the new databases to investigate possible HCN <-> HNC radiative
   isomerization mechanisms, obtaining estimates of conversion efficiencies
   under typical cometary conditions.},

The minimum 'reaction path' is well defined by the analytic function up to 40° for the umbrella angle. Using this PEF, the vibrational levels are calculated variationally using three different methods. The first employs the internal kinetic energy operator developed for ammonia by Handy, Carter and Colwell (Mol. Phys. 96 (1999) 477). The second uses the code \{MULTIMODE\} (J. Chem.

All three approaches give similar energies for the vibrational energies of ammonia, and these agree with experiment to within 15 cm−1 for the fundamental vibrations. }

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2003},

Abstract = {A new vibrational Hamiltonian operator for ammonia is presented. The
   potential energy part is expressed in terms of symmetrized bond-angle
   valence coordinates and an inversion coordinate, which is a function of
   the bond angles. In the exact kinetic energy operator, the stretching
   part is instead given in terms of unsymmetrized bond displacement
   coordinates. Six-dimensional ammonia potential energy surfaces are
   calculated using high-level ab initio tools, the CCSD(T) method with
   aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The potential energy functions
   are constructed in two, two-dimensional steps. The surfaces are
   expressed as a Taylor-type series with respect to the doubly degenerate
   asymmetric stretching and bending coordinates. This representation is
   given along a two-dimensional surface of the totally symmetric
   stretching and inversion coordinates of ammonia. Vibrational energies
   are calculated variationally in a finite basis representation. Employing
   successive basis set contractions, it is possible to optimize some
   potential energy parameters simultaneously for seven symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers very effectively. The symmetric part of the
   surface is fitted to experimentally observed vibrational band centers up
   to 6000 cm(-1). This reduces the mean absolute error from 7.84 cm(-1)
   with a pure ab initio potential to 0.44 cm(-1) compared to the
   experimental values for (14)NH(3). In addition, vibrational energy
   levels of (14)NH(3) have been calculated up to about 15 000 cm(-1) using
   the pure ab initio surface obtained with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The

Abstract = {New potential energy surfaces are calculated for the hydronium ion using
   high-order coupled cluster ab initio methods. Large basis sets are used
   especially for the inversion part of the full surface. Electronic
   energies obtained with different correlation consistent basis sets are
   extrapolated to the infinite basis set limit. Core-valence and first
   order relativistic effects are also included. The influence of these two
   contributions and basis set sizes on both the inversion barrier height
   and equilibrium geometry are investigated thoroughly. The same methods
   are also adopted for ammonia in order to further improve a recently
   published surface {[}J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6358 (2003)]. The vibrational
   eigenvalues are calculated variationally both for the symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers using exact six-dimensional kinetic energy
   operators and successive basis set contractions. With the new surfaces,
   the mean absolute deviations obtained for all experimentally observed
   inversion splittings for different isotopomers of H(3)O(+) (8 states)
   and (14)NH(3) (17 states) are 0.78 and 0.25 cm(-1), respectively.

   results indicate that the calculated inversion barrier heights for
   H(3)O(+) and NH(3), 650 and 1792 cm(-1), respectively, are close to the
   real values. The value for ammonia is also close to the height
   determined from published experimental data in our previous work. The
   lowest energies for the high-frequency modes are computed with the mean

Journal = CP,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {305},
Pages = {105-113},
Abstract = {In the present work, we study the vibrational spectrum of ammonia in
   full dimensionality (6D), with special emphasis on the tunneling
   splitting. The inversion motion, i.e., the active mode v(2), is indeed
   relatively well decoupled from the other five inactive modes. Therefore,
   an adiabatic separation in an active wave function and an inactive one,
   approximated with a 5D-harmonic basis function, is certainly well
   adapted to describing this motion. This separation leads to several
   1D-effective Hamiltonians for each 5D-harmonic basis function or
   adiabatic channel. Two models have been tested: the harmonic adiabatic
   approximation (HADA), when only one channel is used and the coupled HADA
   (cHADA), when several channels are coupled.
   In order to get reliable values for tunneling splitting, our
   calculations have shown that: (i) the calculation of the electronic
   potential has to be performed with a large atomic basis set (up to
   quintuple zeta) with a method including core-valence correlation; (ii)
   the cHADA is required since the HADA overestimates the energy levels.
   Furthermore, our values for the tunneling splitting are in good
   agreement with the experimental data of ammonia and several isotopomers.},

Abstract = {A spectroscopic study of ammonia molecule in the 23 mu m water
   atmospheric window is presented. Compared to previous experimental works
   a narrow, broadly tunable, continuous laser source was applied in order
   to obtain high resolution spectra in this range. It was the first
   application of the newly developed Vertical External Cavity Surface
   Emitting Laser (VECSEL). The analysis of the absorption spectra of two
   different isotopologue admixtures allowed to identify 336 (NH3)-N-14 and
   244 (NH3)-N-15 lines in the studied region from 4275 to 4340 cm(-1).
   These data were compared to previous line list based on experimental
   data - the HITRAN database and the work of Urban et al., as well as to
   the theoretical predictions by Yurchenko et al. and Huang et al.
   Together for 235 (NH3)-N-14 and 183 (NH3)-N-15 lines a complete
   assignment was proposed. From those 63 (NH3)-N-14 and 114 (NH3)-N-15
   transitions were newly assigned. The complete peaklist of transitions
   containing ro-vibrational state identifications is presented in

Abstract = {Systematic analysis of the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio

   K. This information is of great interest in the considerable task of the
   assignment of the complete 1.5 mu m infrared spectral range where
   combination and overtone vibrational bands are present. 2451 transitions
   have been observed at different temperatures. For 2133 the line strength
   and for 1956 transitions the values of lower state energies were
   derived. Our work was compared with recent Fourier transform study
   covering a larger energy range (6300-7000 cm(-1)) with smaller

        have been carried out to generate six-dimensional (6D) potential

        ground state of ammonia. Full 6D-PES and 6D-DMS (14400 points) were
        computed with the augmented correlation-consistent triple-zeta basis
        (aug-cc-pVTZ). For a selected number of points (420 in C-3v symmetry
        and 1260 in lower symmetry), more accurate energies (CBS+) were obtained
        by extrapolating the CCSD(T) results for the aug-cc-pVXZ (X=T,Q,5)
        basis sets to the complete basis set limit and adding corrections
        for core-valence correlation and relativistic effects. Two procedures
        were investigated to enhance the quality of the 6D-PES from CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
        by including the CBS+ data points. The resulting 6D-PES were represented
        by analytical functions involving Morse variables for the stretches,
        symmetry-adapted bending coordinates, and a specially designed inversion
        coordinate (up to 76 fitted parameters, rms deviations of about 5
        cm(-1) for 14 400 ab initio data points). For these analytical surfaces,

        energy operator. Results are presented and compared to experiment
        for the vibrational band centers of NH3 and its isotopomers up to
        around 15 000 cm(-1). For our best 6D-PES, the term values of the
        fundamentals are reproduced with rms deviations of 4.4 cm(-1) (NH3)
        and 2.6 cm(-1) (all isotopomers), the maximum deviation being 7.9

Abstract = {{Accurate, experimental rotational-vibrational energy levels determined

   algorithm and published recently for the symmetric-top (NH3)-N-14
   molecule in J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 2015, 116, 117-130
   are analyzed to unravel the promoting and inhibiting effects of
   vibrations and rotations on the tunneling splittings of the
   corresponding symmetric (s) and antisymmetric (a) rovibrational energy
   level pairs. The experimental transition data useful from the point of
   view of the present analysis cover the range 0.7-7000 cm(-1),
   sufficiently detailed rovibrational energy sets worth analyzing are
   available for 20 vibrational bands. The highest J value, where J stands
   for the rotational quantum number, within the experimental dataset
   employed is 30. Coupling of the ``umbrella'' motion of (NH3)-N-14 with
   other vibrational degrees of freedom has only a minor effect on the a-s
   tunneling splitting characterizing the ground vibrational state,
   0.79436(70) cm(-1). In the majority of the cases rotation around the C-3
   axis increases, while rotation around the two perpendicular axes
   decreases the tunneling splittings. For example, for the pair of
   vibrational ground states, 0(+) and 0(-), the tunneling splitting
   basically disappears at around J = 25 for the (J, K) = (J,1) states,
   where K = vertical bar k vertical bar is the usual quantum number
   characterizing the projection of the rotational angular momentum on the
   principal axis. The tunneling splittings, defined as energy differences
   E(a) - E(s) of corresponding energy level pairs, as a function of J and
   K show a very regular behavior for the ground state (GS) and the n nu(2)
   bands. For the other bands investigated exceptions from a regular
   behavior do occur, especially for bands characterized by degenerate
   vibrations, and occasionally the data available are not sufficient to
   arrive at definitive conclusions. The most irregular behavior is
   observed for rotational states characterized by the k - l = 3n rule (l
   is the vibrational angular momentum quantum number), with n = 0, 1,
   2,... High-quality, variationally computed rovibrational data support
   all the conclusions of this study based on experimental energy levels.}},

Journal = {Acta Physica Sinica},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{66}},
Abstract = {{The target gas molecular absorption spectrum parameters especially line
   strengths are very important for measuring temperature and concentration
   with tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technique.
   Usually, researchers use line strengths which come from spectrum
   database, like HITRAN and GEISA and HITEMP spectra database, but those
   database include values from the theoretical computation, as is well
   known, there is a big error between the theoretical value and the actual
   value. In order to modify the line strengths of the database, 20 ammonia
   spectrum absorption lines in a wavenumber range between 6611 and 6618
   cm(-1) are measured at different pressures by using direct tunable diode
   laser absorption spectroscopy (dTDLAS) technique. The measurement
   procedure is repeated at least 10 times at each pressure, and then
   average value is calculated. Voigt fitting is used to obtain all line
   integral area, and then the line integral area is obtained by linear
   fitting. The slope of the fitting straight line equals line strength.
   Uncertainty analysis is given for the measurements. The measured
   linestrength is a function of integrated area, temperature, pressure,
   species mole fraction and effective path length. So, the calculated
   linestrength uncertainties based on those parameters uncertainties, and
   the uncertainties of pressure, species mole fraction and effective path
   length are similar for all transitions with Delta(P) = 0.25\%,
   Delta(chi) = 0.2\%, and Delta(L) = 0.4\%. The uncertainties of the
   integrated area and temperature are related to different lines, and
   their values come from the actual measurement. In the end, uncertainty
   propagation formula is used to calculate linestrength uncetainty.
   Uncertainties of our measured line strengths are in a 0.81\%-3.33\%
   range. Our measured line strength values are different from line
   strengths in the HITRAN 2012 database, and the deviations are in
   0.51\%-17.28\% range.}},

Pages = {950-958},
Abstract = {{There is increasing industrial demand, particularly within the clean
   room community, for rapid online measurement of a number of airborne
   molecular contaminants. These measurements are usually made with
   commercially available cavity ring-down spectrometers, but more recently
   developed techniques offer potentially better sensitivity and more rapid
   sampling. In this paper we present ammonia spectroscopy data from a
   newly developed noise-immune cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne
   molecular spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS) system at 1532 nm, which is designed
   to be transportable and operate in an industrial environment. We
   demonstrate this using an optical cavity of 9 kHz fringe width (similar
   to 1.5 GHz free spectral range and finesse of 169,000) and a
   distributed-feedback diode laser with a relatively broad similar to 1
   MHz free-running linewidth. The variation in NICE-OHMS ammonia signal
   amplitude is presented at different concentrations in one atmosphere of
   nitrogen, generated from traceable reference standards, with a flow rate
   of 1-2 l/min. We derive a calibration curve for our device for
   concentrations in the range from 100 nmol/mol to 10 mu mol/mol. }},

  journal=ApJ,
  volume={777},
  pages={95},
  year={2013},
  abstract={Super-Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency and some will be able to retain stable H 2 -dominated atmospheres. We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H 2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates. We find that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H 2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high CO 2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules. In Sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV fluxes from UV-quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate. The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulate detectable biosignature gases in an H 2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential biosignature gases, such as dimethylsulfide and CH 3 Cl, are therefore more favorable in low-UV, as compared with solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including NH 3 and N 2 O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated forms of an element, such as CH 4 and H 2 S, are not effective signs of life in an H 2 -rich atmosphere because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature gases in H 2 -rich atmospheres for super-Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope .}
