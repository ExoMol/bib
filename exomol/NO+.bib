Abstract = {Identifying Earth-like planets outside our solar system is a leading
   research goal in astronomy, but determining if candidate planets have
   atmospheres, and more importantly if they can retain atmospheres, is
   still out of reach. In this paper, we present our study on the impact of
   enhanced extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) flux on the stability and escape of
   the upper atmosphere of an Earth-like exoplanet using the Global
   Ionosphere and Thermosphere Model. We also investigate the differences
   between 1D and 3D solutions. We use a baseline case of EUV flux
   experienced at the Earth, and multiply this flux by a constant factor
   going up to 50. Our results show a clear evidence of an inflated and
   elevated ionosphere due to enhanced EUV flux, and they provide a
   detailed picture of how different heating and cooling rates, as well as
   the conductivity, are changing at each EUV flux level. Our results also
   demonstrate that 1D solutions are limited in their ability to capture a
   global atmosphere that is not uniform. We find that a threshold EUV flux
   level for a stable atmosphere occurs around a factor of 10 times the
   baseline level, where EUV fluxes above this level indicate a rapidly
   escaping atmosphere. This threshold EUV flux translates to about 0.3 au
   for a planet orbiting the Sun. Thus, our findings indicate that an
   Earth-like exoplanet orbiting its host star in a close-in orbit is
   likely to lose its atmosphere quickly.},
