Journal =JPB,
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{52}},
Abstract = {{We present photoionization cross sections for two diatomic molecules, CO
   and NO, using a distorted-wave approximation. Both CO and NO are
   important atmospheric molecules, particularly in shock-heated
   atmospheres and in some astrophysical contexts. Photoionization cross
   sections may be used to compute the bound-free absorption contribution,
   which although less relevant than the bound-bound absorption that
   dominates in the near infra-red wavelength band, is still necessary for
   a complete description of molecular absorption. A configurationaverage
   distorted-wave method is used to compute the photoionization cross
   sections based on earlier molecular structure tabulations. Our
   calculations are compared to experiment and good agreement is found at
   incident energies above 40 eV.}},

abstract = {All available line positions for unresolved and resolved Λ-doublets
of the 14N16O molecule in the X2 П state were collected from the literature and
tested using the RITZ computer code. These data have been critically analysed and
used to obtain the most complete set of 1789 experimental energy levels of
unresolved Λ-doublets covering the 0–35,866 cm−1 interval. A set of 425 experimental
energy levels of resolved Λ-doublets covering the 0–5957 cm−1 interval for two
states 2П1/2 and 2П3/2 also have been obtained. These levels together with calculated
correlation matrix can be used to generate the precise list of transitions with
confidence intervals. Comparisons with the HITRAN as well as with Amiot calculations
are discussed. The systematic shift between experimental energy levels of unresolved
Λ-doublets and those calculated by Amiot for 2П3/2 state was found. The same systematic
shift for transitions frequencies of unresolved Λ-doublets in forbidden subbands
2П1/2↔2П3/2 is also established in the HITRAN database. Comparison of the RITZ
energy levels with calculated energy levels by Wong at al. was also done. It was
found, that experimental RITZ energy levels for resolved Λ-doublets of 14N16O
coincide with those calculated by Wong at al. within experimental uncertainties.},

Abstract = {A broadly tunable single-mode quantum cascade laser operating around 5.2

   Zeeman spectrum of Gas-phase (NO)-N-14-O-16. The Zeeman spectrum signals
   in the R (from R-0.5 to R-22.5), Q (from Q(0.5) to Q(6.5)) and P (from
   P-1.5 to P-14.5) branches of the fundamental vibrational transition, X-2
   Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2) (v= 1 0), have been recorded with both large
   spectral region (over the range of 1824-1947 cm(-1)) and high spectral
   resolution (< 0.001 cm(-1)) for the first time. We simulated the
   patterns of magnetic Zeeman split lines in the R, Q, and P branches, and
   calculated the Land g-factor gJ of the (2)Pi(1/2), (2)Pi(3/2) components
   for pure Hund's coupling case (a) and (b), and intermediate coupling
   (a-b) case. The experimental Zeeman spectrum measured at various values
   of magnetic field strength (from 0.04 to 0.32 T) at conditions of both B
   perpendicular to E and B parallel to E was calibrated by a 101.6mm long
   solid germanium etalon with a free spectral range (FSR) of 0.012 cm(-1).
   Good agreement between the calculated Lande g-factors using Radford's
   theory and their best fit values inferred from the experimental data was
   obtained, which suggests that the Lande g-factor in Hund's coupling case
   (a-b) is a better approximation, either at higher rotational quantum
   numbers, or at lower rotational levels, for both (2)Pi(1/2), (2)Pi(3/2)
   subsystems. Our results provide a more general evidence to determine the
   coupling case of NO than previously available, because we can measure
   and simulate the high-resolution and broadband mid-IR Zeeman spectrum
   for both low and high rotational levels of the two subsystems.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {815},
pages = {110},
Abstract = {Planets larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune are some of the most
   numerous in the galaxy, but observational efforts to understand this
   population have proved challenging because optically thick clouds or
   hazes at high altitudes obscure molecular features. We present models of
   super Earths that include thick clouds and hazes and predict their
   transmission, thermal emission, and reflected light spectra. Very thick,
   lofted clouds of salts or sulfides in high metallicity (1000x solar)
   atmospheres create featureless transmission spectra in the
   near-infrared. Photochemical hazes with a range of particle sizes also
   create featureless transmission spectra at lower metallicities. Cloudy
   thermal emission spectra have muted features more like blackbodies, and
   hazy thermal emission spectra have emission features caused by an
   inversion layer at altitudes where the haze forms. Close analysis of
   reflected light from warm (similar to 400-800 K) planets can distinguish
   cloudy spectra, which have moderate albedos (0.05-0.20), from hazy
   models, which are very dark (0.0-0.03). Reflected light spectra of cold
   planets (similar to 200 K) accessible to a space-based visible light
   coronagraph will have high albedos and large molecular features that
   will allow them to be more easily characterized than the warmer
   transiting planets. We suggest a number of complementary observations to
   characterize this population of planets, including transmission spectra
   of hot (greater than or similar to 1000 K) targets, thermal emission
   spectra of warm targets using the James Webb Space Telescope, high
   spectral resolution (R similar to 10(5)) observations of cloudy targets,
   and reflected light spectral observations of directly imaged cold
   targets. Despite the dearth of features observed in super Earth
   transmission spectra to date, different observations will provide rich
   diagnostics of their atmospheres.},

turn shows that IRC +10420 presents a N-rich chemistry. Furthermore, we have found
that to reproduce the observed NO line profiles, the initial abundance of nitrogen

Abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) nightglow data from the SPICAV instrument (SPectroscopy

   onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, currently in orbit around Venus,
   are presented. In its extended source mode, SPICAV has shown that the
   Venus nightglow in the UV contains essentially Lyman-alpha and Nitric
   Oxide (NO) emissions. In the stellar mode, when the slit of the
   spectrometer is removed, an emission is also observed at the limb in
   addition to the stellar spectrum. A forward model allows us to identify
   this feature as being an NO emission. Due to radiative recombination of
   N and O atoms produced on the dayside of Venus, and transported to the
   nightside. NO nightglow provides important constraints to the
   Solar-to-Anti Solar thermospheric circulation prevailing above 90 km.
   The forward model presented here allows us to derive the altitude of the
   peak of emission of the NO layer, found at 113.5 +/- 6 km, as well as
   its scale height, of 3.4 +/- 1 km and its brightness. The latter is
   found to be very variable with emissions between 19 Kilo-Rayleigh (kR)
   and 540 kR. In addition, the NO nightglow is sometimes very patchy, as
   we are able to observe two distinct emission zones in the field of view.
   Finally, systematic extraction of this emission from stellar
   occultations extends the database of the NO emission already reported
   elsewhere using limb observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

determined from an extrapolation of the measured decay rates to zero pressure.
In comparison with prior measurements of these radiative lifetimes, the improved
experimental approach and analysis procedure result in a significant improvement
in the measurement precision. The accuracy of the fluorescence decay-rate measurements
was confirmed by independent measurements using time-correlated single-photon counting

nm photoionization and charge detection. The measured radiative lifetimes are
192.6 +/- 0.2 ns for v' = 0, 186.2 +/- 0.4 ns for v' = 1, and 179.4 +/- 0.7 ns
for v' = 2. The measured lifetimes are shown to be in outstanding agreement with
those predicted by an electronic transition moment that is identical in form to
the function recommended by Luque and Crosley [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7405 (1999)]
after appropriate rescaling. This rescaling does not affect the agreement of the
transition moment function with the previously reported vibrational branching
ratios and improves agreement with previously reported absolute oscillator strength
measurements. Based on the rescaled transition moment, updated values of absolute
transition probabilities in the NO A (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Pi system are presented.},

Title = {{Distribution of the ultraviolet nitric oxide Martian night airglow:
Observations from Mars Express and comparisons with a one-dimensional model}},
Journal = JGRP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
pages = {E08012},
Abstract = {Limb observations with the SPICAM ultraviolet spectrometer on board the
   Mars Express orbiter revealed ultraviolet nightglow emission in the
   delta (190 - 240 nm) and g (225 - 270 nm) bands of nitric oxide. This
   emission arises from radiative recombination between O((3)P) and N((4)S)
   atoms that are produced on the day side and form excited NO molecules on
   the night side. In this study, we analyze the night limb observations
   obtained during the MEX mission. In particular, we describe the
   variability of the emission brightness and its peak altitude. We examine
   possible correlations with latitude, local time, magnetic field strength
   or solar activity. We show that the altitude of maximum emission varies
   between 55 and 92 km while the brightness is in the range 0.2 to 10.5
   kR. The total vertical emission rate ranges from 8 to 237 R with an
   average value of 36 +/- 52 R. The observed topside scale height of the
   emission profile varies between 3.8 and 11.0 km, with a mean value of 6
   +/- 1.7 km. We use a chemical- diffusive atmospheric model where the
   eddy coefficient, whose value in the Mars thermosphere is uncertain, is
   a free parameter to match the observed peak altitude of the emission.
   The model solves the continuity equation for O( 3 P), N( 4 S), and NO
   using a finite volume method on a one- dimensional grid. We find that
   the downward flux of N atoms at 100 km varies by two orders of
   magnitude, ranging from 10(7) to 10(9) atoms cm(-2) s(-1).},

the frequency band from 129.1 to 175.2 GHz, i.e., most of the 2 mm atmospheric
window. We identify 111 spectral features as transitions from 25 different molecular
species. Eight of which ( three tentatively) are detected for the first time in
the extragalactic interstellar medium. Among these newly detected species, we
detected the rare isotopomers (SO)-S-34 and (HCO+)-O-18. Tentative detections
of two deuterated species, DNC and N2D+, are reported for the first time from a
target beyond the Magellanic Clouds. In addition, three hydrogen recombination
lines are identified, while no organic molecules larger than methanol are detected.
Column densities and rotation temperatures are calculated for all the species,
including an upper limit to the ethanol abundance. A comparison of the chemical
composition of the nuclear environment of NGC 253 with those of selected nearby
galaxies demonstrates the chemical resemblance of IC 342 and NGC 4945 to that of
NGC 253. On the other hand, the chemistries characterizing NGC 253 and M82 are
clearly different. We also present a comparison of the chemical composition of
NGC 253 with those observed in Galactic prototypical sources. The chemistry of
NGC 253 shows a striking similarity with the chemistry observed toward the Galactic
center molecular clouds, which are thought to be dominated by low-velocity shocks.
This resemblance strongly suggests that the heating in the nuclear environment of
NGC 253 is dominated by the same mechanism as that in the central region of the Milky Way.},

electric dipole moment function (EDMF) of nitric oxide, valid for 0.91⩽r⩽1.74Å,
has been extracted. The residuals of this fit demonstrate that the derived EDMF

where the vibrational excitation energy slightly exceeds the surface work function.
This threshold behavior strongly suggests that we are observing the direct conversion
of NO vibrational energy into electron kinetic energy. Several potential mechanisms
for the observed electron emission are explored, including (1) vibrational
autodetachment, (2) an Auger-type two-electron process, and (3) vibrationally

the MIPAS instrument on board the ENVISAT satellite during the solar storm of
October/November 2003. Spectral modeling of the NO(Δv = 1) fundamental band emissions
was performed in order to determine the NO rotational and spin‐orbit distributions.
In the thermosphere, NO(v = 1) is produced by collisional excitation of NO(v = 0)
by O atoms and also by the chemical reactions of N(4S) and N(2D) atoms with O2.
There are no measurements of the nascent spin‐orbit distribution of NO produced by
the reaction of N atoms with O2. Auroral activity leads to increased production
of N(4S) and N(2D) atoms, resulting in enhanced chemical formation of NO. In the
MIPAS data taken during the solar storm, strong NO signal levels and increased
rotational temperatures indicated high levels of auroral activity. A comparison
of the data from October/November 2003 with data taken during a quiescent period
in June 2003 showed that NO(v = 1) produced by N + O2 has a hotter spin‐orbit
distribution than NO(v = 1) produced by O atom collisional excitation. The results
imply that the spin‐orbit ratio may be useful for identifying different sources of
NO in the thermosphere. In addition, the NO(v = 1) spin‐orbit distributions were
found not to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (non‐LTE) for both quiescent
and auroral conditions. The non‐LTE effects must be taken into account in order
to accurately retrieve atmospheric NO concentrations from 5.3 μm emissions.},

the four lowest NO+ target channels, namely (1)Sigma(+), E-3(+), (3)Pi and (3)Delta.
Energy and bond length variations of the quantum defect functions for all target
states are reported. Certain small surface amplitude R-matrix poles also serve
to determine the energies of valence states. Diabatic potential curves for Rydberg
states converging to the (1)Sigma(+) and (3)Sigma(+) target states and for the
valence states are presented. Systematic jumps in the psigma quantum defects for
all target states as the bond length increases beyond R = 2.5 an are attributed
to Rydbergization of the antibonding 2psigma* molecular orbital.},

storage in vibrational excitation of the ground electronic state, both the a (4)Pi
L(2)Phi excited electronic states are predicted to have relatively high number
densities because they are only weakly connected to lower electronic stales by
radiative decay. Fundamental mode radiative transitions involving the lowest nine
excited vibrational levels in the ground electronic state are predicted to produce
infrared (IR) radiation from 5.33 to 6.05 mu m with greater intensity than any

abstract = {The reaction of O(D-1) with N2O produces two kinds of NO molecules,
the "old" one which originally exists in N2O and the "new" one which includes the
attacking O atom. Using the isotopically labeled reagent, we determined the vibrational
state distributions of these NO's (X (2)Pi; v=0-17) separately. To obtain the
distributions, two types of experiments were performed with the laser-induced
fluorescence (LIF) technique via the NO A<--X and B<--X transitions. First, the
relative populations of NO molecules (the sum of the two kinds of NO's) in v=0-11
levels were measured with unlabeled reagents. Then, isotopically labeled reaction,
O-18(D-1)+(N2O)-O-16-->(NO)-O-18+(NO)-O-16, was utilized to determine the relative
ratio between the two kinds of NO's in the vibrational levels of v=0-5 and 12-15.
Combining the above results with previously determined vibrational state distribution
of NO in high vibrational levels (v=11-17) [J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 94, 1575
(1998)], we were able to obtain a complete set of vibrational state distributions.
It was found that the old NO dominantly populated in v=0 and 1 whereas the new NO
extended its population toward higher vibrational levels (v=4-15). However, in
high vibrational levels, the old NO still have a considerable population due to
the rapid energy transfer to the old NO. The observed efficient energy transfer
to the old NO is attributed to the absence of light atoms in the present reacting
system. Compared with the system including hydrogen atoms, the state density and
the momentum coupling among the vibrational modes are much larger and accelerate
the energy redistribution in spite of the short lifetime.},

abstract = {In order to interpret the experimental results of the state resolved
UV-laser-induced desorption of NO from NiO(100) (rotational and vibrational populations,
velocity distributions of the desorbing NO molecules, etc.), we have performed
ab initio complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and configuration
interaction (CI) calculations for the interaction potential between NO and the
NiO(100) surface in the electronic ground state and for those excited states which
are involved in the desorption process. The NiO(100)-NO distance and the tilt
angle between the NO axis and the surface normal have been varied. A cluster model
containing a NiO58--cluster embedded in a Madelung potential has been used for
representing the NiO(100) surface. The excited states which are important for the
desorption process, are charge transfer states of the substrate-adsorbate system,
in which one electron is transferred from the surface into the NO-2 pi-orbital.
The potential curves of these excited charge transfer states show deep minima (4 eV-5 eV)
at surface/NO distances which are smaller than that in the ground state. The angular
dependence of these potentials behaves similar as in the ground state. A semiempirical
correction to the calculated excitation energies has been added which makes use of
the bulk polarization of NiO. With this correction the charge transfer states are
considerably stabilized. The lowest excitation energy amounts to about 4 eV which
is in reasonable agreement with the onset of the laser desorption observed experimentally
at about 3.5 eV. The density of the NO--like states is rather high, so that probably
several excited states are involved in the desorption process. The potential energy
curves for all of these states are quite similar, but the transitions from the ground
state into different excited charge transfer states show strongly differing oscillator
strengths, which are also strongly dependent on the surface/NO distance. This fact
is important for the dynamics of the deexcitation process in the sense of a selection
criterion for the states involved. The magnitude of the oscillator strengths is
large in comparison with the excitation of NO in the gas phase, which might be
an indication for the possibility of optical excitation processes. One dimensional
wave packet calculations on two potential energy curves using fixed lifetimes for
the excited state in each calculation have been performed and enable us to estimate
the mean lifetime of the excited state to be 15 fs less than or equal to tau less
than or equal to 25 fs. This implies that the dynamics of the system is dominated
by the attractive part of the excited state potential. (C) 1996 American Institute

moment function employed, centrifugal distortion has a relatively small effect
on the Δv = 1 sequence which is manifest primarily as a reduction in the high-J
R-branch intensities. However, the effect on the overtone rotational intensities
is larger and results in enhanced R-branch intensities and reduced P-branch
intensities relative to those calculated neglecting centrifugal distortion. For
example, in the first overtone system for J′ ≈ 80.5, v′ = 2–14, the ratio of R-

the effects of electron correlation and relaxation. The experimental momentum

assigned to transitions from the rotational levels (II3/2)-I-2(10.5) in v=0 and
(II1/2)-I-2( 17.5) in v=3. These particular B (II)-I-2 levels are perturbed by
specific levels of the a (II)-I-4 state, serving as so-called gateways to allow
the otherwise spin-forbidden a (II)-I-4, --> B (II)-I-2 collision-induced transition.
An external magnetic field has strong effect on the collision-induced emission
from the NO(B, v=0) level. With paramagnetic target gases, direct spin-changing
NO(a--> B) collisional transfer was also observed in addition to the gateway transitions.
The selectivity for the final state level is much weaker here. The collision-induced

Nagy et al. [1990], and Gerard et al. [1991, 1993]. Shematovich et al. [1991],
using a non-equilibrium kinetic model, have calculated the steady-state translational
energy distribution of the ground state (4S) nitrogen atoms in the daylit atmosphere
of the Earth at 140 km altitude. The calculated distribution shows a significant
overpopulation of higher energy atoms over a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the
local translational temperature of 555K, of one and three orders of magnitude at
energies of 0.5eV and 0.75eV, respectively, and the rate coefficient k(ne) for
the process N(4S) + O2 --> NO + O + 1.385eV (1) is enhanced by several orders
of magnitude over the thermal rate coefficient k(e). At an altitude of 110 km,
where the temperature is about 275K, the thermal rate coefficient obtained from
the standard expression k(e) = 4.4 x 10(-12)exp[-3220/T]cm3sec-1 [Rees, 1989]
is 3.6 x 10(-17)cm3sec-1, whereas the nonequilibrium value is 2.0 x 10(-11)cm3s-1
[Shematovich et al. 1991]. The reaction of the hot N(4S) atoms with O2 provides an
additional mechanism for the production of nitric oxide. Gerard et al. [1991]
calculated that for solar minimum conditions at equatorial latitudes this additional
mechanism contributes 6 to 30 percent of the nitric oxide,produced in the lower
thermosphere.},

vibrational quantum number dependence of the vibrational relaxation of highly
vibrationally excited nitric oxide and oxygen. The NO experiments are one of the
first data sets on bimolecular energy transfer for molecules with several hundreds
of kJ/mol of internal energy. Information is obtained showing to what extent energy
transfer theories designed for low vibrational energy can be applied in this case.
Strong evidence is also obtained suggesting that qualitatively different mechanisms
such as 'transient chemical bond formation'' can influence the rate of vibrational
energy transfer at high vibrational energy. Analogous experiments on O2 have also
been carried out. Compelling evidence for the vibrationally enhanced endothermic
chemical reaction O2(v) + O2 --> O3 + O has been obtained. The possible relevance
of these results to the stratospheric ozxone budget is also discussed.},

NO2, which in turn predissociates to form NO before going through a multiphoton

high-temperature reactions, although the observed abundances do not disagree

one order of magnitude. The abundance of NO, unlike other simple interstellar

vibrational transition exhibiting a maximum at excited vibrational states and then
becoming nearly forbidden at higher vibrational states; in this region, the Δn=2

expected for NO or for any heteronuclear diatomic molecule whose dipole moment has

abstract = {Satellite lines in the spectrum of nitric oxide which correspond to
transitions 2Π32, v=1, J′←2Π½, v=0, J were observed. Intensity measurements show
that these lines are of the order of 10—4 times less intense than the fundamental
and have intensities which agree with theoretical predictions. From line‐frequency
measurements the multiplet splitting parameter is obtained for both the v=0 and
v=1 vibrational levels. The values obtained are A0=123.1 cm—1 and A1=122.9 cm—1.
The intensity of the fundamental is found to be 138 cm—2/atm at 273°K, which
corresponds to a dipole moment derivative of 2.32 D/Å.},

abstract = {Precise measurements of the band origins of the 2Π½—2Π½ and 2Π32⎯2Π32
subbands of the fundamental of nitric oxide and of the band origin of the 1–0 2Π32⎯2Π12
satellite band provides accurate values for the spin—orbit coupling constants A0
and A1 for the v=0 and v=1 vibrational levels. The values obtained are A0=123.160
cm—1 and A1=122.911 cm—1. When these results are combined with the results of Olman,
McNelis, and Hause, precise values of A2 and A3 are also obtained. They are A2=122.658
cm—1 and A3=122.360 cm—1. Causes for the discrepancy in A values calculated from
other investigators' results are discussed. Certain discrepancies in rotational
constants obtained from this and other infrared studies are pointed out and briefly
discussed.},

been studied in an attempt to prove the existence of the (NO)2 molecule. The liquid
has four strong Raman lines at 1861, 262, 196, and 167 cm−1; two weaker Raman lines
at 1760 and 487 cm−1; and two strong infrared bands at 1863 and 1770 cm−1. Several
weaker infrared bands can be satisfactorily assigned as combinations by using the
observed strong infrared and Raman frequencies. The spectra were found to be due
exclusively to a dimer which probably exists as a bent ONNO molecule.},
