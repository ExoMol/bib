   abstract = {The vibrational state distribution has been determined for vibrationally excited NO((XII)-I-2; v = 11-17) produced by the reaction of O(D-1) with N2O. O(D-1) atoms were generated by O-3 photodissociation at 266 mn and the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique via the NO (BII)-I-2 <-- (XII)-I-2 transition was utilized to obtain the vibrational state distribution. The LIF spectra were taken under conditions in which the vibrational relaxation of NO is negligible while its rotational relaxation is sufficiently achieved. The rate constant for quenching by O-3 was also determined, as the loss of NO(B) due to quenching by reactant gases should be taken into account when the LIF data are analysed Based on the large exothermicity of this reaction, significant excitation in the vibrational state of NO(X) is expected; however, the vibrational state distribution was similar to, but slightly colder than, that predicted from statistical theories. Possible mechanisms which may explain such an unexpected distribution are discussed.},

   journal = JCP,
   volume = {111},
   pages = {115-122},
   abstract = {The reaction of O(D-1) with N2O produces two kinds of NO molecules, the "old" one which originally exists in N2O and the "new" one which includes the attacking O atom. Using the isotopically labeled reagent, we determined the vibrational state distributions of these NO's (X (2)Pi; v=0-17) separately. To obtain the distributions, two types of experiments were performed with the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique via the NO A<--X and B<--X transitions. First, the relative populations of NO molecules (the sum of the two kinds of NO's) in v=0-11 levels were measured with unlabeled reagents. Then, isotopically labeled reaction, O-18(D-1)+(N2O)-O-16-->(NO)-O-18+(NO)-O-16, was utilized to determine the relative ratio between the two kinds of NO's in the vibrational levels of v=0-5 and 12-15. Combining the above results with previously determined vibrational state distribution of NO in high vibrational levels (v=11-17) [J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 94, 1575 (1998)], we were able to obtain a complete set of vibrational state distributions. It was found that the old NO dominantly populated in v=0 and 1 whereas the new NO extended its population toward higher vibrational levels (v=4-15). However, in high vibrational levels, the old NO still have a considerable population due to the rapid energy transfer to the old NO. The observed efficient energy transfer to the old NO is attributed to the absence of light atoms in the present reacting system. Compared with the system including hydrogen atoms, the state density and the momentum coupling among the vibrational modes are much larger and accelerate the energy redistribution in spite of the short lifetime.

New integral electron impact excitation cross sections for NO were combined with a measured IBC II auroral secondary electron distribution, and the vibrational populations of 10 NO electronic states were determined under conditions of statistical equilibrium. This model predicts an extended vibrational distribution in the NO ground electronic state produced by radiative cascade from the seven higher-lying doublet excited electronic states populated by electron impact. In addition to significant energy storage in vibrational excitation of the ground electronic state, both the a (4)Pi L(2)Phi excited electronic states are predicted to have relatively high number densities because they are only weakly connected to lower electronic stales by radiative decay. Fundamental mode radiative transitions involving the lowest nine excited vibrational levels in the ground electronic state are predicted to produce infrared (IR) radiation from 5.33 to 6.05 mu m with greater intensity than any single NO electronic emission band. Fundamental mode radiative transitions within the a (4)Pi, electronic state, in the 10.08-11.37 mu m region, are predicted to have IR intensities comparable to individual electronic emission bands in the Heath and epsilon band systems. Results from this model quantitatively predict the vibrational quantum number dependence of the NO IR measurements of Espy et al. [1988].},

   pages = {10030-10040},
   abstract = {In order to interpret the experimental results of the state resolved UV-laser-induced desorption of NO from NiO(100) (rotational and vibrational populations, velocity distributions of the desorbing NO molecules, etc.), we have performed ab initio complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and configuration interaction (CI) calculations for the interaction potential between NO and the NiO(100) surface in the electronic ground state and for those excited states which are involved in the desorption process. The NiO(100)-NO distance and the tilt angle between the NO axis and the surface normal have been varied. A cluster model containing a NiO58--cluster embedded in a Madelung potential has been used for representing the NiO(100) surface. The excited states which are important for the desorption process, are charge transfer states of the substrate-adsorbate system, in which one electron is transferred from the surface into the NO-2 pi-orbital. The potential curves of these excited charge transfer states show deep minima (4 eV-5 eV) at surface/NO distances which are smaller than that in the ground state. The angular dependence of these potentials behaves similar as in the ground state. A semiempirical correction to the calculated excitation energies has been added which makes use of the bulk polarization of NiO. With this correction the charge transfer states are considerably stabilized. The lowest excitation energy amounts to about 4 eV which is in reasonable agreement with the onset of the laser desorption observed experimentally at about 3.5 eV. The density of the NO--like states is rather high, so that probably several excited states are involved in the desorption process. The potential energy curves for all of these states are quite similar, but the transitions from the ground state into different excited charge transfer states show strongly differing oscillator strengths, which are also strongly dependent on the surface/NO distance. This fact is important for the dynamics of the deexcitation process in the sense of a selection criterion for the states involved. The magnitude of the oscillator strengths is large in comparison with the excitation of NO in the gas phase, which might be an indication for the possibility of optical excitation processes. One dimensional wave packet calculations on two potential energy curves using fixed lifetimes for the excited state in each calculation have been performed and enable us to estimate the mean lifetime of the excited state to be 15 fs less than or equal to tau less than or equal to 25 fs. This implies that the dynamics of the system is dominated by the attractive part of the excited state potential. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

simulate a more rapid onset of the Rydbergization of the B2-PI state. The

The differences are that the maximum signal appears for larger magnetic field amplitudes and pressures, similar to 1500 G and similar to 200 Torr, respectively. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America},

The effective temperature describing the observed population distribution is as much as 700 K lower than the local kinetic temperature. Absolute NO(upsilon=1, J, OMEGA) column densities were derived from high-resolution (1 cm-1) infrared earthlimb spectra for tangent altitudes up to 200 km, obtained in the CIRRIS 1A Space Shuttle experiment. Nonlinear least-squares synthetic spectral fitting was used to analyze the NO DELTAupsilon=1 fundamental band emissions near 5.3 mum. The spin-orbit distribution represents and third degree of freedom, along with vibration and rotation, that is not in equilibrium with the local kinetic temperature. These observations may significantly impact the interpretation of band-integrated measurements of NO in the upper atmosphere, for which equilibrium sublevel distributions have been assumed. The subthermal distribution is most likely produced in the collisional uppumping of NO(upsilon=0) by O atoms, which is the major source of NO(upsilon=1) in the thermosphere. This inference suggests that the present effect is related to the subthermal spin-orbit distributions observed in laboratory studies of NO2 photodissociation.},

In this paper we extend the wavelength range to study nitrobenzene at shorter wavelengths and also investigate another nitroaromatic compound, o-nitrotoluene, where similar behaviour is observed. We also report laser ionisation of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over the same wavelength region. Comparison of the various spectra suggests that the nitroaromatic parent molecules predissociate releasing NO2, which in turn predissociates to form NO before going through a multiphoton ionisation process. The hydrocarbon components of the o-nitrotoluene molecule also ionise, but there is no evidence of distinctive resonance enhancement of any of these fragment ions in the wavelength range studied.},

Eight of which ( three tentatively) are detected for the first time in the extragalactic interstellar medium. Among these newly detected species, we detected the rare isotopomers (SO)-S-34 and (HCO+)-O-18. Tentative detections of two deuterated species, DNC and N2D+, are reported for the first time from a target beyond the Magellanic Clouds. In addition, three hydrogen recombination lines are identified, while no organic molecules larger than methanol are detected. Column densities and rotation temperatures are calculated for all the species, including an upper limit to the ethanol abundance. A comparison of the chemical composition of the nuclear environment of NGC 253 with those of selected nearby galaxies demonstrates the chemical resemblance of IC 342 and NGC 4945 to that of NGC 253. On the other hand, the chemistries characterizing NGC 253 and M82 are clearly different. We also present a comparison of the chemical composition of NGC 253 with those observed in Galactic prototypical sources. The chemistry of NGC 253 shows a striking similarity with the chemistry observed toward the Galactic center molecular clouds, which are thought to be dominated by low-velocity shocks. This resemblance strongly suggests that the heating in the nuclear environment of NGC 253 is dominated by the same mechanism as that in the central region of the Milky Way.},

After dissociation, NO is observed to remain mainly in the centre of the distal haem pocket, although some movement towards the primary docking site and the xenon-4 pocket can be seen. We calculate the NO infrared spectrum for the photodissociated ligand within the haem pocket and find a narrow peak in the range 1915-1922 cm(-1). The resulting blue shift of 1, to 8 cm(-1) compared to gas-phase NO is much smaller than the red shifts calculated and observed for carbon monoxide (CO) in Mb. A small splitting, due to NO in the xenon-4, pocket, is also observed. At lower, temperatures, the spectra and conformational space explored by the ligand remain largely unchanged, but the electrostatic interactions with residue His64, become increasingly significant in determining the details of the ligand orientation within the distal haem pocket. The investigation, of the effect of the L29F mutation reveals significant differences between the behaviour of NO and that of CO, and suggests a coupling between the ligand and the protein dynamics due to the different ligand dipole moments.},

In the ultraviolet part of the spectrum long beta band progressions originating from the B-state vibrational levels v=0 and 3 were observed. In each band only a few lines appear, which were assigned to transitions from the rotational levels (II3/2)-I-2(10.5) in v=0 and (II1/2)-I-2( 17.5) in v=3. These particular B (II)-I-2 levels are perturbed by specific levels of the a (II)-I-4 state, serving as so-called gateways to allow the otherwise spin-forbidden a (II)-I-4, --> B (II)-I-2 collision-induced transition. An external magnetic field has strong effect on the collision-induced emission from the NO(B, v=0) level. With paramagnetic target gases, direct spin-changing NO(a--> B) collisional transfer was also observed in addition to the gateway transitions. The selectivity for the final state level is much weaker here. The collision-induced Ogawa band emission in the near-infrared showed smooth, partially resolved rotational contours with all target gases. This indicates that the collisional. transfer NO(a-->b) within the quartet system is also not of the highly restrictive gateway:type, but results from direct collisional coupling.},

   abstract = {This paper details an investigation of the variation in the electronic transition moment with internuclear separation for the NO(B2-PI-X2-PI) transition. Measurements of the relative intensities of a number of NO B-X vibronic transitions having a common upper level were used to construct a relative transition-moment function between 1.27 and 1.60 angstrom. After normalizing this relative function by experimentally determined radiative lifetimes, the transition-moment function was extended down to 1.23 angstrom by incorporating data from oscillator strength measurements. In contrast to empirical transition-moment functions that have been proposed previously, the function in this paper decreases with increasing internuclear separation. Unlike these other functions, however, this one is consistent with theoretical predictions, with most available oscillator strength data, and with the observed trend in B-state radiative lifetimes as a function of vibrational level.},

We counted on a detailed model of the structure and kinematics of the molecular gas around IRC +10420. In addition, we used a chemical model to derive the NO abundance profile. We modified the initial nitrogen abundance in order to fit the observed NO profiles. These synthetic profiles were obtained using an LVG radiative transfer code. Results. We have detected NO in a circumstellar envelope for the first time, along with a variety of N-rich molecules, which in turn shows that IRC +10420 presents a N-rich chemistry. Furthermore, we have found that to reproduce the observed NO line profiles, the initial abundance of nitrogen in the chemical model has to be increased by a factor 20 with respect to the values of the standard O-rich stars.},

The presently reported experimental momentum profiles of NO and O-2 display much improved statistics compared with previously published EMS results while the data for the HOMO of NO, is the first reported. In the case of NO, the present measurements are considerably different from previous results and these differences appear to be due to the presence of NO2 impurities in the previous work. The EMS measurements provide a stringent test of basis set effects and the quality of ab initio methods in the description of these open shell systems. The experimental momentum profiles have been compared with theoretical spherically averaged momentum profiles from several basis sets calculated at the level of the target Hartree-Fock approximation (THFA) with a range of basis sets using both unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and restricted open shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) methods. Various configuration interaction calculations such as multi-reference singles and doubles configuration interaction (MRSD-CI), averaged coupled pair functional (ACPF) and quasi-degenerate variational perturbation theory (QDVPT) calculations of the full ion-neutral overlap amplitude have also been compared to experiment to investigate the effects of electron correlation and relaxation. The experimental momentum profiles have further been compared to calculations at the level of the target Kohn-Sham approximation (TKSA) using density functional theory (DFT) with the local density approximation and also with gradient corrected exchange-correlation potentials. In addition to momentum profiles, other electronic properties such as total energies, dipole moments, quadrupole moments and values of the electronic spatial extent have been calculated by the various theoretical methods and compared to experimental values.},

   abstract = {Improved measurements of the radiative lifetimes of NO A (2)Sigma(+)(v' = 0,1,2) are presented and used to update the absolute electronic transition moment for the NO gamma bands. The pressure-dependent fluorescence decay rate was measured in a low-pressure, room-temperature, flow cell containing dilute mixtures of NO in N-2 using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence excited with a picosecond laser and detected with a microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube. Fluorescence decay rates were determined using an analysis procedure that accounted for the electronic response of the detection system and measurement noise. Radiative lifetimes were determined from an extrapolation of the measured decay rates to zero pressure. In comparison with prior measurements of these radiative lifetimes, the improved experimental approach and analysis procedure result in a significant improvement in the measurement precision. The accuracy of the fluorescence decay-rate measurements was confirmed by independent measurements using time-correlated single-photon counting and time-resolved probing of laser-excited population in A (2)Sigma(+) using 266 nm photoionization and charge detection. The measured radiative lifetimes are 192.6 +/- 0.2 ns for v' = 0, 186.2 +/- 0.4 ns for v' = 1, and 179.4 +/- 0.7 ns for v' = 2. The measured lifetimes are shown to be in outstanding agreement with those predicted by an electronic transition moment that is identical in form to the function recommended by Luque and Crosley [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7405 (1999)] after appropriate rescaling. This rescaling does not affect the agreement of the transition moment function with the previously reported vibrational branching ratios and improves agreement with previously reported absolute oscillator strength measurements. Based on the rescaled transition moment, updated values of absolute transition probabilities in the NO A (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Pi system are presented. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

Although the experimental instrumentation could address neither the parameter space of the theory nor the optimum conditions, the line shapes and the pressure dependence could be verified under low-field conditions. NO could be detected down to a partial pressure of 13 mu Torr, roughly corresponding to 10 ppb.m for an atmospheric pressure sample, which demonstrates the feasibility of FAMOS for sensitive detection of NO addressing its strong electronic band.

   abstract = {Reaction of fast non-thermal N(4S) atoms with O2 molecules is shown to produce NO with large rotational and vibrational excitation. It is suggested that the process is responsible for the highly rotationally excited nitric oxide detected by the space shuttle experiment CIRRIS 1A. The influence of translationally hot atoms on the chemical composition and energetics of planetary thermospheres has been investigated by Logan and McElroy [1976], Solomon [1983], Fox and Dalgarno [1983], Nagy et al. [1990], and Gerard et al. [1991, 1993]. Shematovich et al. [1991], using a non-equilibrium kinetic model, have calculated the steady-state translational energy distribution of the ground state (4S) nitrogen atoms in the daylit atmosphere of the Earth at 140 km altitude. The calculated distribution shows a significant overpopulation of higher energy atoms over a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature of 555K, of one and three orders of magnitude at energies of 0.5eV and 0.75eV, respectively, and the rate coefficient k(ne) for the process N(4S) + O2 --> NO + O + 1.385eV (1) is enhanced by several orders of magnitude over the thermal rate coefficient k(e). At an altitude of 110 km, where the temperature is about 275K, the thermal rate coefficient obtained from the standard expression k(e) = 4.4 x 10(-12)exp[-3220/T]cm3sec-1 [Rees, 1989] is 3.6 x 10(-17)cm3sec-1, whereas the nonequilibrium value is 2.0 x 10(-11)cm3s-1 [Shematovich et al. 1991]. The reaction of the hot N(4S) atoms with O2 provides an additional mechanism for the production of nitric oxide. Gerard et al. [1991] calculated that for solar minimum conditions at equatorial latitudes this additional mechanism contributes 6 to 30 percent of the nitric oxide,produced in the lower thermosphere.},

Nonlocal functionals considerably improve the bond dissociation energies, but the results still overestimate the experimental values by about 10 kcal/mol on average. For the other properties, the results obtained with nonlocal functionals are not necessarily superior to those calculated with the local functional.

Nuclear dynamics has been applied to the spectral simulations in order to construct the vibrational envelope associated with the x-ray emission processes.

The quantum efficiency increases strongly with v, increasing up to 10(-2) electrons per NO (v) collision, a value several orders of magnitude larger than that observed in experiments with similar molecules in the ground vibrational state. The electron emission signal, as a function of v, has a threshold where the vibrational excitation energy slightly exceeds the surface work function. This threshold behavior strongly suggests that we are observing the direct conversion of NO vibrational energy into electron kinetic energy. Several potential mechanisms for the observed electron emission are explored, including (1) vibrational autodetachment, (2) an Auger-type two-electron process, and (3) vibrationally promoted dissociation.

   abstract = {The dependence of vibrational energy transfer on vibrational
excitation has been studied using the stimulated emission pumping technique to
efficiently prepare a large range of specific vibrational states of the nitric
oxide molecule in its ground electronic state. Laser induced fluorescence was
used to detect collisionally relaxed NO. The self-relaxation rate constants of
NO (upsilon >> 1) were up to 200 times larger than that of NO (upsilon = 1).
Multiquantum relaxation was found to be important at high energy and was
quantified at 3.8 eV. Self-relaxation rate constants of N-15O-18 as well as
N-14O-16 were measured and a large isotope effect was observed. Relaxation of NO
(upsilon'' = 22) with H-2 was also investigated. Theoretical explanations of our
experimental results were attempted and it is shown that at vibrational energy
up to almost-equal-to 3 eV the qualitative trends observed in these experiments
such as the mass effect and the multiquantum relaxation can be explained by
Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld theory. A simple explanation of the anomalously high
NO self-relaxation rate is given. The large acceleration of the vibrational
relaxation rate above 3.0 eV is coincident with the energetic onset of high
energy (NO)2 isomer complexes. More theoretical and experimental work is needed
to explain the quantitative aspects of these observations.},

By comparing this new set of results with previously measured results for upsilon = 2 [Aa. Sudbo and M. M. T. Loy, J. Chem. Phys. 76, 3646 (1982)] the vibrational influence on the rotational and spin-orbit energy transfer dynamics could be evaluated. Total depopulation rate constants for individual rovibrational states were found to be very similar for upsilon = 2, 8, and 19. State-to-state rotational energy transfer rate constants could be compared for upsilon = 8 and 19, and again only small differences were found.

This article describes studies of the vibrational quantum number dependence of the vibrational relaxation of highly vibrationally excited nitric oxide and oxygen. The NO experiments are one of the first data sets on bimolecular energy transfer for molecules with several hundreds of kJ/mol of internal energy. Information is obtained showing to what extent energy transfer theories designed for low vibrational energy can be applied in this case. Strong evidence is also obtained suggesting that qualitatively different mechanisms such as 'transient chemical bond formation'' can influence the rate of vibrational energy transfer at high vibrational energy. Analogous experiments on O2 have also been carried out. Compelling evidence for the vibrationally enhanced endothermic chemical reaction O2(v) + O2 --> O3 + O has been obtained. The possible relevance of these results to the stratospheric ozxone budget is also discussed.},

The absorption transitions R (7.5) were selected according to HITRAN database to minimize interference from water vapor and CO2. The line strength is about 10(-23) CM-1 / (molecule/cm(2)), and a minimum detectable of 30 ppm was obtained with wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS-2f) method. The 1.79 mu m distributed feed-back (DFB) diode laser has a narrow line width. The measurement was validated in a gas cell at 300K, where NO concentrations using both scanned-wavelength direct absorption (DA) and wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS-2f) strategies were validated against calibrated mixture concentrations. Then the wavelength modulation measurement was validated in heated gas cell in a tubular furnace (373 similar to 573K). The laboratory use LabVIEW program to realize data acquisition and to realize the real-time display of the concentration of the gas through direct absorption method. In the laboratory, we also analyze the concentrations of the NO using WMS at different temperature (300K-573K).},

Both lambda-doubling components of NO were observed towards all sources. Column densities derived for nitric oxide in these clouds are N approximately 10(15)-10(16) cm-2, corresponding to fractional abundances of f approximately 0.5-1.0 x 10(-8), relative to H2. Towards Orion-KL, the NO line profile suggests that the species arises primarily from hot, dense gas. Nitric oxide may arise from warm material toward the other clouds as well. Nitric oxide in star-forming regions could be synthesized by high-temperature reactions, although the observed abundances do not disagree with values predicted from low-temperature, ion-molecule chemistry by more than one order of magnitude. The abundance of NO, unlike other simple interstellar nitrogen compounds, does appear to be reproduced by chemical models, at least to a good approximation. Regardless of the nature of formation of NO, it appears to be a common constituent of warm, dense molecular clouds. N-O bonds may therefore be more prevalent than previously thought.},

Moreover, the accurate ab initio potential energy curve (PEC) and \{EDMF\} were found using the multi-reference averaged quadratic coupled-cluster (AQCC) approach with the basis set aug-cc-pV6Z (aV6Z). The good agreement of the vibrational transition moments, computed using the Rydberg�Klein�Rees (RKR) potential and the fitted EDMFs, with experiments shows the present fitted \{EDMF\} could be more accurate than other fitted ones at the valid range. Our ab initio vibrational transition moments agree better with experimental data than the ones calculated using the previous theoretical \{PEC\} and EDMF, especially at the high overtones. We expect that the present study will be helpful for the transitions including high  and high overtone bands of NO. }

Title = {Distribution of the ultraviolet nitric oxide Martian night airglow:
   Observations from Mars Express and comparisons with a one-dimensional
   model},
Journal = JGRP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {113},
Abstract = {Limb observations with the SPICAM ultraviolet spectrometer on board the
   Mars Express orbiter revealed ultraviolet nightglow emission in the
   delta (190 - 240 nm) and g (225 - 270 nm) bands of nitric oxide. This
   emission arises from radiative recombination between O((3)P) and N((4)S)
   atoms that are produced on the day side and form excited NO molecules on
   the night side. In this study, we analyze the night limb observations
   obtained during the MEX mission. In particular, we describe the
   variability of the emission brightness and its peak altitude. We examine
   possible correlations with latitude, local time, magnetic field strength
   or solar activity. We show that the altitude of maximum emission varies
   between 55 and 92 km while the brightness is in the range 0.2 to 10.5
   kR. The total vertical emission rate ranges from 8 to 237 R with an
   average value of 36 +/- 52 R. The observed topside scale height of the
   emission profile varies between 3.8 and 11.0 km, with a mean value of 6
   +/- 1.7 km. We use a chemical- diffusive atmospheric model where the
   eddy coefficient, whose value in the Mars thermosphere is uncertain, is
   a free parameter to match the observed peak altitude of the emission.
   The model solves the continuity equation for O( 3 P), N( 4 S), and NO
   using a finite volume method on a one- dimensional grid. We find that
   the downward flux of N atoms at 100 km varies by two orders of
   magnitude, ranging from 10(7) to 10(9) atoms cm(-2) s(-1).},

Abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) nightglow data from the SPICAV instrument (SPectroscopy
   for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Venus)
   onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, currently in orbit around Venus,
   are presented. In its extended source mode, SPICAV has shown that the
   Venus nightglow in the UV contains essentially Lyman-alpha and Nitric
   Oxide (NO) emissions. In the stellar mode, when the slit of the
   spectrometer is removed, an emission is also observed at the limb in
   addition to the stellar spectrum. A forward model allows us to identify
   this feature as being an NO emission. Due to radiative recombination of
   N and O atoms produced on the dayside of Venus, and transported to the
   nightside. NO nightglow provides important constraints to the
   Solar-to-Anti Solar thermospheric circulation prevailing above 90 km.
   The forward model presented here allows us to derive the altitude of the
   peak of emission of the NO layer, found at 113.5 +/- 6 km, as well as
   its scale height, of 3.4 +/- 1 km and its brightness. The latter is
   found to be very variable with emissions between 19 Kilo-Rayleigh (kR)
   and 540 kR. In addition, the NO nightglow is sometimes very patchy, as
   we are able to observe two distinct emission zones in the field of view.
   Finally, systematic extraction of this emission from stellar
   occultations extends the database of the NO emission already reported
   elsewhere using limb observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {815},
Abstract = {Planets larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune are some of the most
   numerous in the galaxy, but observational efforts to understand this
   population have proved challenging because optically thick clouds or
   hazes at high altitudes obscure molecular features. We present models of
   super Earths that include thick clouds and hazes and predict their
   transmission, thermal emission, and reflected light spectra. Very thick,
   lofted clouds of salts or sulfides in high metallicity (1000x solar)
   atmospheres create featureless transmission spectra in the
   near-infrared. Photochemical hazes with a range of particle sizes also
   create featureless transmission spectra at lower metallicities. Cloudy
   thermal emission spectra have muted features more like blackbodies, and
   hazy thermal emission spectra have emission features caused by an
   inversion layer at altitudes where the haze forms. Close analysis of
   reflected light from warm (similar to 400-800 K) planets can distinguish
   cloudy spectra, which have moderate albedos (0.05-0.20), from hazy
   models, which are very dark (0.0-0.03). Reflected light spectra of cold
   planets (similar to 200 K) accessible to a space-based visible light
   coronagraph will have high albedos and large molecular features that
   will allow them to be more easily characterized than the warmer
   transiting planets. We suggest a number of complementary observations to
   characterize this population of planets, including transmission spectra
   of hot (greater than or similar to 1000 K) targets, thermal emission
   spectra of warm targets using the James Webb Space Telescope, high
   spectral resolution (R similar to 10(5)) observations of cloudy targets,
   and reflected light spectral observations of directly imaged cold
   targets. Despite the dearth of features observed in super Earth
   transmission spectra to date, different observations will provide rich
   diagnostics of their atmospheres.},

Only predissociated rotational levels of the lower state appear in the spectrum. For v = 0 of C2Π a single mixed level Ty(J = 512) = 52431 cm−1, very close to the dissociation limit, gives rise to laser lines.}

Title = {{High-resolution and broadband mid-infrared Zeeman spectrum of gas-phase
   nitric oxide using a quantum cascade laser around 5.2 mu m}},
Journal = JPB,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{50}},
pages = {035401},
Abstract = {{A broadly tunable single-mode quantum cascade laser operating around 5.2
   mu m has been used to study the high-resolution and broadband mid-IR
   Zeeman spectrum of Gas-phase (NO)-N-14-O-16. The Zeeman spectrum signals
   in the R (from R-0.5 to R-22.5), Q (from Q(0.5) to Q(6.5)) and P (from
   P-1.5 to P-14.5) branches of the fundamental vibrational transition, X-2
   Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2) (v= 1 0), have been recorded with both large
   spectral region (over the range of 1824-1947 cm(-1)) and high spectral
   resolution (< 0.001 cm(-1)) for the first time. We simulated the
   patterns of magnetic Zeeman split lines in the R, Q, and P branches, and
   calculated the Land g-factor gJ of the (2)Pi(1/2), (2)Pi(3/2) components
   for pure Hund's coupling case (a) and (b), and intermediate coupling
   (a-b) case. The experimental Zeeman spectrum measured at various values
   of magnetic field strength (from 0.04 to 0.32 T) at conditions of both B
   perpendicular to E and B parallel to E was calibrated by a 101.6mm long
   solid germanium etalon with a free spectral range (FSR) of 0.012 cm(-1).
   Good agreement between the calculated Lande g-factors using Radford's
   theory and their best fit values inferred from the experimental data was
   obtained, which suggests that the Lande g-factor in Hund's coupling case
   (a-b) is a better approximation, either at higher rotational quantum
   numbers, or at lower rotational levels, for both (2)Pi(1/2), (2)Pi(3/2)
   subsystems. Our results provide a more general evidence to determine the
   coupling case of NO than previously available, because we can measure
   and simulate the high-resolution and broadband mid-IR Zeeman spectrum
   for both low and high rotational levels of the two subsystems.}},
