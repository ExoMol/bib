abstract = {The highly rotationally excited states in the A2Σ+-X2ΠΩ band of NO

The rotational states with J up to 80.5 were prepared by CH3ONO photodissociation
in the S1 and S2 excited states for spectroscopic measurements. In total, 3890
lines of nine vibronic bands were analyzed. The observed line positions deviated
from the values calculated using the previous molecular constants as J increased
in the J > 50.5 region. The sextet-order centrifugal distortion constants were
determined for the A2Σ+and X2ΠΩ states so that the transition frequencies associated
with the high-J states could reproduce the observed results within the experimental
accuracy. The band origin values, whose errors have been discussed in previous
studies, were refined in the present analysis. The experimental condition to suppress
the rotational relaxation of the high-J states was examined, enabling us to determine
the higher-order centrifugal distortion constants.},

Abstract = {High Rydberg states of nitric oxide (NO) with principal quantum numbers

   by resonance enhanced two-color two-photon laser excitation from the X
   (2)Pi(1/2) ground state through the A (2)Sigma(+) intermediate state.
   Molecules in these long-lived Rydberg states were detected and
   characterized 126 mu s after laser photoexcitation by state-selective
   pulsed electric field ionization. The laser excitation and electric
   field ionization data were combined to construct two-dimensional
   spectral maps. These maps were used to identify the rotational states of
   the NO+ ion core to which the observed series of long-lived hydrogenic
   Rydberg states converge. The results presented pave the way for
   Rydberg-Stark deceleration and electrostatic trapping experiments with
   NO, which are expected to shed further light on the decay dynamics of
   these long-lived excited states, and are of interest for studies of
   ion-molecule reactions at low temperatures.},

Abstract = {A broadly tunable single-mode quantum cascade laser operating around 5.2
   mu m has been used to study the high-resolution and broadband mid-IR
   Zeeman spectrum of Gas-phase (NO)-N-14-O-16. The Zeeman spectrum signals
   in the R (from R-0.5 to R-22.5), Q (from Q(0.5) to Q(6.5)) and P (from
   P-1.5 to P-14.5) branches of the fundamental vibrational transition, X-2
   Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2) (v= 1 0), have been recorded with both large
   spectral region (over the range of 1824-1947 cm(-1)) and high spectral
   resolution (< 0.001 cm(-1)) for the first time. We simulated the
   patterns of magnetic Zeeman split lines in the R, Q, and P branches, and
   calculated the Land g-factor gJ of the (2)Pi(1/2), (2)Pi(3/2) components
   for pure Hund's coupling case (a) and (b), and intermediate coupling
   (a-b) case. The experimental Zeeman spectrum measured at various values
   of magnetic field strength (from 0.04 to 0.32 T) at conditions of both B
   perpendicular to E and B parallel to E was calibrated by a 101.6mm long
   solid germanium etalon with a free spectral range (FSR) of 0.012 cm(-1).
   Good agreement between the calculated Lande g-factors using Radford's
   theory and their best fit values inferred from the experimental data was
   obtained, which suggests that the Lande g-factor in Hund's coupling case
   (a-b) is a better approximation, either at higher rotational quantum
   numbers, or at lower rotational levels, for both (2)Pi(1/2), (2)Pi(3/2)
   subsystems. Our results provide a more general evidence to determine the
   coupling case of NO than previously available, because we can measure
   and simulate the high-resolution and broadband mid-IR Zeeman spectrum
   for both low and high rotational levels of the two subsystems.},

Title = {{Thermal emission and reflected light spectra of super earths with flat
   transmission spectra}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {815},
pages = {110},
Abstract = {Planets larger than Earth and smaller than Neptune are some of the most
   numerous in the galaxy, but observational efforts to understand this
   population have proved challenging because optically thick clouds or
   hazes at high altitudes obscure molecular features. We present models of
   super Earths that include thick clouds and hazes and predict their
   transmission, thermal emission, and reflected light spectra. Very thick,
   lofted clouds of salts or sulfides in high metallicity (1000x solar)
   atmospheres create featureless transmission spectra in the
   near-infrared. Photochemical hazes with a range of particle sizes also
   create featureless transmission spectra at lower metallicities. Cloudy
   thermal emission spectra have muted features more like blackbodies, and
   hazy thermal emission spectra have emission features caused by an
   inversion layer at altitudes where the haze forms. Close analysis of
   reflected light from warm (similar to 400-800 K) planets can distinguish
   cloudy spectra, which have moderate albedos (0.05-0.20), from hazy
   models, which are very dark (0.0-0.03). Reflected light spectra of cold
   planets (similar to 200 K) accessible to a space-based visible light
   coronagraph will have high albedos and large molecular features that
   will allow them to be more easily characterized than the warmer
   transiting planets. We suggest a number of complementary observations to
   characterize this population of planets, including transmission spectra
   of hot (greater than or similar to 1000 K) targets, thermal emission
   spectra of warm targets using the James Webb Space Telescope, high
   spectral resolution (R similar to 10(5)) observations of cloudy targets,
   and reflected light spectral observations of directly imaged cold
   targets. Despite the dearth of features observed in super Earth
   transmission spectra to date, different observations will provide rich
   diagnostics of their atmospheres.},

Abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) nightglow data from the SPICAV instrument (SPectroscopy
   for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Venus)
   onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, currently in orbit around Venus,
   are presented. In its extended source mode, SPICAV has shown that the
   Venus nightglow in the UV contains essentially Lyman-alpha and Nitric
   Oxide (NO) emissions. In the stellar mode, when the slit of the
   spectrometer is removed, an emission is also observed at the limb in
   addition to the stellar spectrum. A forward model allows us to identify
   this feature as being an NO emission. Due to radiative recombination of
   N and O atoms produced on the dayside of Venus, and transported to the
   nightside. NO nightglow provides important constraints to the
   Solar-to-Anti Solar thermospheric circulation prevailing above 90 km.
   The forward model presented here allows us to derive the altitude of the
   peak of emission of the NO layer, found at 113.5 +/- 6 km, as well as
   its scale height, of 3.4 +/- 1 km and its brightness. The latter is
   found to be very variable with emissions between 19 Kilo-Rayleigh (kR)
   and 540 kR. In addition, the NO nightglow is sometimes very patchy, as
   we are able to observe two distinct emission zones in the field of view.
   Finally, systematic extraction of this emission from stellar
   occultations extends the database of the NO emission already reported
   elsewhere using limb observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

abstract = {Improved measurements of the radiative lifetimes of NO A (2)Sigma(+)(v'

in a low-pressure, room-temperature, flow cell containing dilute mixtures of NO in N-2
using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence excited with a picosecond laser and
detected with a microchannel-plate photomultiplier tube. Fluorescence decay rates
were determined using an analysis procedure that accounted for the electronic
response of the detection system and measurement noise. Radiative lifetimes were
determined from an extrapolation of the measured decay rates to zero pressure.
In comparison with prior measurements of these radiative lifetimes, the improved
experimental approach and analysis procedure result in a significant improvement
in the measurement precision. The accuracy of the fluorescence decay-rate measurements
was confirmed by independent measurements using time-correlated single-photon counting
and time-resolved probing of laser-excited population in A (2)Sigma(+) using 266
nm photoionization and charge detection. The measured radiative lifetimes are
192.6 +/- 0.2 ns for v' = 0, 186.2 +/- 0.4 ns for v' = 1, and 179.4 +/- 0.7 ns
for v' = 2. The measured lifetimes are shown to be in outstanding agreement with
those predicted by an electronic transition moment that is identical in form to
the function recommended by Luque and Crosley [J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7405 (1999)]
after appropriate rescaling. This rescaling does not affect the agreement of the
transition moment function with the previously reported vibrational branching
ratios and improves agreement with previously reported absolute oscillator strength
measurements. Based on the rescaled transition moment, updated values of absolute
transition probabilities in the NO A (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Pi system are presented.},

abstract = {Two prominent features of the Venus nightside airglow are
the nitric oxide d and g bands produced by radiative association of O and N atoms
in the lower thermosphere and the O2 infrared emission generated by
three-body recombination of oxygen atoms in the upper mesosphere.
The O2 airglow has been observed from the ground, during the Cassini flyby,
and with VIRTIS on board Venus Express. It now appears that the global structure of
the two emissions shows some similarities, but the statistical location of
the region of strongest emission is not coincident. The Spectroscopy for
Investigation of Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Venus (SPICAV) ultraviolet spectrograph
has collected a large number of spectra of the Venus nitric oxide nightside airglow.
Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) images have been obtained
at the limb and in the nadir-viewing mode and have provided new information on the horizontal
and vertical distribution of the emission. We present the first concurrent observations of
the two emissions observed with Venus Express. We show that nadir observations generally
indicate a low degree of correlation between the two emissions observed quasi-simultaneously
at a common location. A statistical study of limb profiles indicates that the altitude and
the brightness of the two airglow layers generally do not covary. We suggest that this
lack of correlation is explained by the presence of strong horizontal winds in the
mesosphere-thermosphere transition region. They carry the downflowing atoms over large distances
in such a way that regions of enhanced NO emission generally do not coincide with zones
of bright O 2 airglow. Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

These emissions arise from radiative recombination between O(3P) and N(4S) atoms

on the nightside. No other emission feature has been identified.
The mean altitude of the emission layer is located at 113 km,

The mean brightness of the total NO emission at the limb is 32 kR,
but it is highly variable with limb intensities as large as 440 kR observed
at low latitude and values below 5 kR seen at northern midlatitudes.
No systematic dependence of the brightness with latitude is observed,
but the mean altitude of the emission maximum statistically drops with
increasing latitude between 6° and 72°N. Typical observed limb profiles
are compared with simulations based on a one-dimensional chemical-diffusive atmospheric model.
From model fits to observed profiles, we find that the downward flux of N atoms
at 130 km typically varies between 1×108 to 4×10 9 atoms cm-2 s-1.
Comparisons of observed airglow topside scale heights with modeled profiles
smoothed by the instrumental field of view indicate that the observations are
compatible with a downward flow of O and N atoms by molecular and turbulent transport above
the peak of emission. The K coefficient deduced from comparisons to limb profiles is
less than that determined from the observations made with the Pioneer Venus UV spectrometer

the extragalactic interstellar medium. Among these newly detected species, we
detected the rare isotopomers (SO)-S-34 and (HCO+)-O-18. Tentative detections
of two deuterated species, DNC and N2D+, are reported for the first time from a
target beyond the Magellanic Clouds. In addition, three hydrogen recombination
lines are identified, while no organic molecules larger than methanol are detected.
Column densities and rotation temperatures are calculated for all the species,
including an upper limit to the ethanol abundance. A comparison of the chemical
composition of the nuclear environment of NGC 253 with those of selected nearby
galaxies demonstrates the chemical resemblance of IC 342 and NGC 4945 to that of
NGC 253. On the other hand, the chemistries characterizing NGC 253 and M82 are
clearly different. We also present a comparison of the chemical composition of
NGC 253 with those observed in Galactic prototypical sources. The chemistry of
NGC 253 shows a striking similarity with the chemistry observed toward the Galactic
center molecular clouds, which are thought to be dominated by low-velocity shocks.
This resemblance strongly suggests that the heating in the nuclear environment of

abstract = {Aurorally enhanced 5.3 μm emission from nitric oxide was observed by
the MIPAS instrument on board the ENVISAT satellite during the solar storm of
October/November 2003. Spectral modeling of the NO(Δv = 1) fundamental band emissions
was performed in order to determine the NO rotational and spin‐orbit distributions.
In the thermosphere, NO(v = 1) is produced by collisional excitation of NO(v = 0)
by O atoms and also by the chemical reactions of N(4S) and N(2D) atoms with O2.
There are no measurements of the nascent spin‐orbit distribution of NO produced by
the reaction of N atoms with O2. Auroral activity leads to increased production
of N(4S) and N(2D) atoms, resulting in enhanced chemical formation of NO. In the
MIPAS data taken during the solar storm, strong NO signal levels and increased
rotational temperatures indicated high levels of auroral activity. A comparison
of the data from October/November 2003 with data taken during a quiescent period
in June 2003 showed that NO(v = 1) produced by N + O2 has a hotter spin‐orbit
distribution than NO(v = 1) produced by O atom collisional excitation. The results
imply that the spin‐orbit ratio may be useful for identifying different sources of
NO in the thermosphere. In addition, the NO(v = 1) spin‐orbit distributions were
found not to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (non‐LTE) for both quiescent
and auroral conditions. The non‐LTE effects must be taken into account in order
to accurately retrieve atmospheric NO concentrations from 5.3 μm emissions.},

conditions in the cell. In motor neurons, nitric oxide enhances brain-derived

trophic factors, nitric oxide induces motor neuron apoptosis by reacting with
superoxide to form peroxynitrite. The mechanism of induction of motor neuron
apoptosis by the formation of peroxynitrite is more complicated than simply the
formation of a strong oxidant and it also involves decreased formation of cGMP.},

$\Pi$+1/2, J = 3/2 → 1/2 line of NO in the 2 mm band toward the core

Kitt Peak 12 m telescope. Emission from NO was found to be extended over
a region 2′ × 5′ in size that includes the Sgr B2 (N), Sgr B2 (M), and Sgr
B2 (OH) positions, very similar to the distribution found for HNO.
In contrast, N2O emission was confined to a source approximately 1′ in extent,
slightly elongated in the north-south direction and centered on the Sgr B2 (N)
core. A virtually identical distribution was found for the JK$\tau$ = 140 → 14-1
E transition of methanol, which lies 255 K above ground state and samples very
hot gas. Excitation conditions are favorable for the J = 6 → 5 line of N2O over
the entire NO region; hence, the confined nature of this species is a result of
chemistry. The J = 3 → 2 and J = 9 → 8 lines of N2O at 75 and 226 GHz,
respectively, were also detected at Sgr B2 (N). Combined with the J = 6 → 5 data,
these transitions indicate a column density for this molecule of Ntot ∼
1.5 × 1015 cm-2 at this position and an abundance of f(N2O/H2) ∼ 1.5 × 10-9.
This fractional abundance is almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than predicted
by low-temperature chemical models. The N2O observations suggest that this
molecule is preferentially formed in high-temperature gas; a likely mechanism
is the neutral-neutral reaction NO + NH → N2O + H, which has an appreciable
rate only at T {\textgreater} 125 K. The column density of NO found over the
Sgr B2 cloud was Ntot ∼ (0.8-1.5) × 1016 cm-2, corresponding to a fractional
abundance of f(NO/H2) ∼ (0.8-1.5) × 10-8, which is about 1 order of magnitude
less than model predictions. The similar distributions of NO and HNO suggest a
chemical connection. It is likely that the major route to HNO is from NO via
the ion-molecule process NO + HNO+ → NO+ + HNO, which occurs readily at low
temperatures. The NO molecule thus appears to be the main precursor species in
the N/O chemical network.},

electronic states populated by electron impact. In addition to significant energy
storage in vibrational excitation of the ground electronic state, both the a (4)Pi
L(2)Phi excited electronic states are predicted to have relatively high number
densities because they are only weakly connected to lower electronic stales by
radiative decay. Fundamental mode radiative transitions involving the lowest nine
excited vibrational levels in the ground electronic state are predicted to produce
infrared (IR) radiation from 5.33 to 6.05 mu m with greater intensity than any
single NO electronic emission band. Fundamental mode radiative transitions within
the a (4)Pi, electronic state, in the 10.08-11.37 mu m region, are predicted to

journal = JCP,
year = {1999},

abstract = {The reaction of O(D-1) with N2O produces two kinds of NO molecules,
the "old" one which originally exists in N2O and the "new" one which includes the
attacking O atom. Using the isotopically labeled reagent, we determined the vibrational
state distributions of these NO's (X (2)Pi; v=0-17) separately. To obtain the
distributions, two types of experiments were performed with the laser-induced
fluorescence (LIF) technique via the NO A<--X and B<--X transitions. First, the
relative populations of NO molecules (the sum of the two kinds of NO's) in v=0-11
levels were measured with unlabeled reagents. Then, isotopically labeled reaction,
O-18(D-1)+(N2O)-O-16-->(NO)-O-18+(NO)-O-16, was utilized to determine the relative
ratio between the two kinds of NO's in the vibrational levels of v=0-5 and 12-15.
Combining the above results with previously determined vibrational state distribution
of NO in high vibrational levels (v=11-17) [J. Chem. Soc., Faraday Trans. 94, 1575
(1998)], we were able to obtain a complete set of vibrational state distributions.
It was found that the old NO dominantly populated in v=0 and 1 whereas the new NO
extended its population toward higher vibrational levels (v=4-15). However, in
high vibrational levels, the old NO still have a considerable population due to
the rapid energy transfer to the old NO. The observed efficient energy transfer
to the old NO is attributed to the absence of light atoms in the present reacting
system. Compared with the system including hydrogen atoms, the state density and
the momentum coupling among the vibrational modes are much larger and accelerate
the energy redistribution in spite of the short lifetime.},

diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater,

ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions
with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore
populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by
N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have
altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the
availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility
of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their
influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile
forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen
inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental
consequences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available
scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen
cycle have: 1) approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the
terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing; 2) increased
concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N2O globally, and increased
concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical
smog over large regions of Earth; 3) caused losses of soil nutrients, such as
calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil
fertility; 4) contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams,
and lakes in several regions; and 5) greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen
through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review
of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the
nitrogen cycle have: 6) increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within
terrestrial ecosystems; 7) accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially
losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals
and microorganisms that depend on them; and 8) caused changes in the composition
and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term
declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

probabilities of NO(X(2)Pi)}},
journal = JQSRT,
year = {1996},

pages = {481-492},
abstract = {State-to-state and thermally averaged Einstein A -coefficients have
been computed for the fundamental and first three overtone sequences of the
NO(X2II-X2II) system with the aim of examining the effects of centrifugal distortion
on the high-J transitions that occur as a result of upper atmospheric chemistry.
The Einstein coefficients were calculated using an experimentally derived dipole
moment function of Rawlins et al (manuscipt in preparation), and the ab initio
dipole moment functions of Langhoff et al [Chem. Phys. Lett. 223, 416 (1994)] and
de Vivie and Peyerimhoff [J. Chem. Phys. 89, 3027 (1988)], for J′ ranging up to
139.5. The state-specific Einstein coefficients show that, regardless of dipole
moment function employed, centrifugal distortion has a relatively small effect
on the Δv = 1 sequence which is manifest primarily as a reduction in the high-J
R-branch intensities. However, the effect on the overtone rotational intensities
is larger and results in enhanced R-branch intensities and reduced P-branch
intensities relative to those calculated neglecting centrifugal distortion. For
example, in the first overtone system for J′ ≈ 80.5, v′ = 2–14, the ratio of R-
to P-branch Einstein coefficients is larger by about 1.7 than the RP ratio predicted
in the absence of centrifugal distortion.},

potential surfaces for intermediate excited states}},
journal = JCP,
year = {1996},
volume = {104},
pages = {10030-10040},
abstract = {In order to interpret the experimental results of the state resolved
UV-laser-induced desorption of NO from NiO(100) (rotational and vibrational populations,
velocity distributions of the desorbing NO molecules, etc.), we have performed
ab initio complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and configuration
interaction (CI) calculations for the interaction potential between NO and the
NiO(100) surface in the electronic ground state and for those excited states which
are involved in the desorption process. The NiO(100)-NO distance and the tilt
angle between the NO axis and the surface normal have been varied. A cluster model
containing a NiO58--cluster embedded in a Madelung potential has been used for
representing the NiO(100) surface. The excited states which are important for the
desorption process, are charge transfer states of the substrate-adsorbate system,
in which one electron is transferred from the surface into the NO-2 pi-orbital.
The potential curves of these excited charge transfer states show deep minima (4 eV-5 eV)
at surface/NO distances which are smaller than that in the ground state. The angular
dependence of these potentials behaves similar as in the ground state. A semiempirical
correction to the calculated excitation energies has been added which makes use of
the bulk polarization of NiO. With this correction the charge transfer states are
considerably stabilized. The lowest excitation energy amounts to about 4 eV which
is in reasonable agreement with the onset of the laser desorption observed experimentally
at about 3.5 eV. The density of the NO--like states is rather high, so that probably
several excited states are involved in the desorption process. The potential energy
curves for all of these states are quite similar, but the transitions from the ground
state into different excited charge transfer states show strongly differing oscillator
strengths, which are also strongly dependent on the surface/NO distance. This fact
is important for the dynamics of the deexcitation process in the sense of a selection
criterion for the states involved. The magnitude of the oscillator strengths is
large in comparison with the excitation of NO in the gas phase, which might be
an indication for the possibility of optical excitation processes. One dimensional
wave packet calculations on two potential energy curves using fixed lifetimes for
the excited state in each calculation have been performed and enable us to estimate
the mean lifetime of the excited state to be 15 fs less than or equal to tau less
than or equal to 25 fs. This implies that the dynamics of the system is dominated
by the attractive part of the excited state potential. (C) 1996 American Institute

previous work. The EMS measurements provide a stringent test of basis set effects
and the quality of ab initio methods in the description of these open shell systems.
The experimental momentum profiles have been compared with theoretical spherically
averaged momentum profiles from several basis sets calculated at the level of the
target Hartree-Fock approximation (THFA) with a range of basis sets using both
unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and restricted open shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) methods.
Various configuration interaction calculations such as multi-reference singles and
doubles configuration interaction (MRSD-CI), averaged coupled pair functional (ACPF)
and quasi-degenerate variational perturbation theory (QDVPT) calculations of the
full ion-neutral overlap amplitude have also been compared to experiment to investigate
the effects of electron correlation and relaxation. The experimental momentum
profiles have further been compared to calculations at the level of the target
ohn-Sham approximation (TKSA) using density functional theory (DFT) with the local
density approximation and also with gradient corrected exchange-correlation potentials.
In addition to momentum profiles, other electronic properties such as total energies,
dipole moments, quadrupole moments and values of the electronic spatial extent have
been calculated by the various theoretical methods and compared to experimental values.},

of the spectrum long beta band progressions originating from the B-state vibrational

assigned to transitions from the rotational levels (II3/2)-I-2(10.5) in v=0 and
(II1/2)-I-2( 17.5) in v=3. These particular B (II)-I-2 levels are perturbed by
specific levels of the a (II)-I-4 state, serving as so-called gateways to allow
the otherwise spin-forbidden a (II)-I-4, --> B (II)-I-2 collision-induced transition.
An external magnetic field has strong effect on the collision-induced emission
from the NO(B, v=0) level. With paramagnetic target gases, direct spin-changing
NO(a--> B) collisional transfer was also observed in addition to the gateway transitions.
The selectivity for the final state level is much weaker here. The collision-induced
Ogawa band emission in the near-infrared showed smooth, partially resolved rotational

Nagy et al. [1990], and Gerard et al. [1991, 1993]. Shematovich et al. [1991],
using a non-equilibrium kinetic model, have calculated the steady-state translational
energy distribution of the ground state (4S) nitrogen atoms in the daylit atmosphere
of the Earth at 140 km altitude. The calculated distribution shows a significant
overpopulation of higher energy atoms over a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the
local translational temperature of 555K, of one and three orders of magnitude at
energies of 0.5eV and 0.75eV, respectively, and the rate coefficient k(ne) for
the process N(4S) + O2 --> NO + O + 1.385eV (1) is enhanced by several orders
of magnitude over the thermal rate coefficient k(e). At an altitude of 110 km,
where the temperature is about 275K, the thermal rate coefficient obtained from
the standard expression k(e) = 4.4 x 10(-12)exp[-3220/T]cm3sec-1 [Rees, 1989]
is 3.6 x 10(-17)cm3sec-1, whereas the nonequilibrium value is 2.0 x 10(-11)cm3s-1
[Shematovich et al. 1991]. The reaction of the hot N(4S) atoms with O2 provides an
additional mechanism for the production of nitric oxide. Gerard et al. [1991]
calculated that for solar minimum conditions at equatorial latitudes this additional
mechanism contributes 6 to 30 percent of the nitric oxide,produced in the lower
thermosphere.},

of highly vibrationally excited molecules increasingly appealing, enabling sophisticated

and chemical reactivity, may be studied. This article describes studies of the
vibrational quantum number dependence of the vibrational relaxation of highly
vibrationally excited nitric oxide and oxygen. The NO experiments are one of the
first data sets on bimolecular energy transfer for molecules with several hundreds
of kJ/mol of internal energy. Information is obtained showing to what extent energy
transfer theories designed for low vibrational energy can be applied in this case.
Strong evidence is also obtained suggesting that qualitatively different mechanisms
such as 'transient chemical bond formation'' can influence the rate of vibrational
energy transfer at high vibrational energy. Analogous experiments on O2 have also
been carried out. Compelling evidence for the vibrationally enhanced endothermic
chemical reaction O2(v) + O2 --> O3 + O has been obtained. The possible relevance
of these results to the stratospheric ozxone budget is also discussed.},

NO2, which in turn predissociates to form NO before going through a multiphoton
ionisation process. The hydrocarbon components of the o-nitrotoluene molecule also
ionise, but there is no evidence of distinctive resonance enhancement of any of

Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld theory. A simple explanation of the anomalously high

high-temperature reactions, although the observed abundances do not disagree
with values predicted from low-temperature, ion-molecule chemistry by more than
one order of magnitude. The abundance of NO, unlike other simple interstellar

wells. The 2Σ+ states exhibit only distinct potential minima in the Rydberg area

valence states. The lifetimes of the Rydberg states A, C, and D are calculated in

 involves the formation of NO(a4$\Pi$) and (b4$\Sigma$-) states as precursors,
 in agreement with previous workers. However, the evidence favours a reassignment
 of the vibrational v′ numbering scheme for NO(b4$\Sigma$-) with respect to
 that currently accepted. The revised v′ are shown to be consistent with both
 spectroscopic evidence and the mechanism for population of NO(B2$\Pi$) levels.
 This allows NO(b) (v′ = 0) to be the immediate precursor of NO(B) (v = 0).
 Calculation of the b4$\Sigma$- potential energy curve according to the revised scheme
 gives a De value of 275.6 ± 1.6 kJ mol-1, and indicates that the highest level
 so far observed is v′ = 6. The negative temperature coefficient observed for the

A1-0 = 121 ± 6 cm−2 Agt−1 and A2-0 = 2.17 ± 0.11 cm−2 Agt−1. A theory developed
by Tipping is applied to evaluate the dipole moment coefficients unambiguously,
including their signs, from the absolute intensity values and the difference between
the mean frequency factor and the band origin. The following expansion for the
dipole moment function in the ground state of NO is determined: M(x) = −0.166 + 2.54x − 1.99x2
(in Debye). The absorption profiles of both the 1-0 and 2-0 bands in NOAr mixtures
show marked changes as gas pressure increases; some of the factors influencing the
shapes of the bands are also discussed. The plots of the integrated intensity vs
rare gas density are found to be straight lines with positive slopes. This linear
increase of the band intensity with density is interpreted as mainly due to the
apparent induced absorption.},

three different isotopes.Interactions with non-Rydberg levels and predissociations

crossing between the 3dσ,π(ν = 1) and B2Π(ν = 23) rotational levels. Off-diagonal
matrix elements are determined and precise vibrational and rotational constants are

element which is shown to be independent of ν.},
