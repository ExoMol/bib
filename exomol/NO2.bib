Abstract = {{We present a high-resolution, high-temperature version of the Nitrogen
   Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank called NDSD-1000. The databank contains
   the line parameters (positions, intensities, self-and air-broadening
   coefficients, exponents of the temperature dependence of self-and
   air-broadening coefficients) of the principal isotopologue of NO2. The
   reference temperature for line intensity is 296 K and the intensity
   cutoff is 10(-25) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) at 1000 K. The broadening
   parameters are presented for two reference temperatures 296 K and 1000
   K. The databank has 1,046,808 entries, covers five spectral regions in
   the 466-4776 cm(-1) spectral range and is designed for temperatures up
   to 1000 K. The databank is based on the global modeling of the line
   positions and intensities performed within the framework of the method
   of effective operators. The parameters of the effective Hamiltonian and
   the effective dipole moment operator have been fitted to the observed
   values of the line positions and intensities collected from the
   literature. The broadening coefficients as well as the temperature
   exponents are calculated using the semi-empirical approach. The databank
   is useful for studying high temperature radiative properties of NO2.
