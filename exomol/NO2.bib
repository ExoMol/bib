Abstract = {{Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on Earth today has biogenic and anthropogenic
   sources. During the Covid-19 pandemic, observations of global NO2
   emissions have shown a significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon
   this example of NO2 as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional
   photochemical model and synthetic spectral generator to assess the
   detectability of NO2 as an atmospheric technosignature on exoplanets. We
   consider cases of an Earth-like planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf, and
   M-dwarf stars. We find that NO2 concentrations increase on planets
   around cooler stars because there are fewer short-wavelength photons
   that can photolyze NO2. In cloud-free results, present Earth-level NO2
   on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10 pc can be detected
   with signal-to-noise ratio similar to 5 within similar to 400 hr with a
   15 m LUVOIR-like telescope when observed in the 0.2-0.7 mu m range where
   NO2 has a strong absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the
   detectability and could mimic the NO2 feature. Historically, global NO2
   levels were 3x higher, indicating the capability of detecting a
   civilization at the stage where Earth's civilization was 40 yr ago.
   Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral
   signatures of NO2 on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need
   several hundred hours of observation time, both due to weaker NO2
   absorption in this region and because of masking features by dominant
   H2O and CO2 bands in the infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at
   these levels could be used to place upper limits on the prevalence of
   NO2 as a technosignature.}},

Title = {{NDSD-1000: High-resolution, high-temperature Nitrogen Dioxide
   Spectroscopic Databank}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {205-217},
Abstract = {{We present a high-resolution, high-temperature version of the Nitrogen
   Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank called NDSD-1000. The databank contains
   the line parameters (positions, intensities, self-and air-broadening
   coefficients, exponents of the temperature dependence of self-and
   air-broadening coefficients) of the principal isotopologue of NO2. The
   reference temperature for line intensity is 296 K and the intensity
   cutoff is 10(-25) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) at 1000 K. The broadening
   parameters are presented for two reference temperatures 296 K and 1000
   K. The databank has 1,046,808 entries, covers five spectral regions in
   the 466-4776 cm(-1) spectral range and is designed for temperatures up
   to 1000 K. The databank is based on the global modeling of the line
   positions and intensities performed within the framework of the method
   of effective operators. The parameters of the effective Hamiltonian and
   the effective dipole moment operator have been fitted to the observed
   values of the line positions and intensities collected from the
   literature. The broadening coefficients as well as the temperature
   exponents are calculated using the semi-empirical approach. The databank
   is useful for studying high temperature radiative properties of NO2.
