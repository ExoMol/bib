Title = {{The absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide between 8325 and 8622 cm(-1)}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{262}},
Abstract = {{The weak high-resolution absorption spectrum of natural nitrous oxide
   has been recorded by high sensitivity cavity ring down spectroscopy
   (CRDS) near 1.18 mu m. The frequency scale of the spectra was obtained
   by coupling the CRDS spectrometer to a self-referenced frequency comb.
   The room temperature recordings, performed with a pressure of 1 Torr,
   cover the 8325-8622 cm(-1) spectral interval where previous observations
   were very scarce. More than 3300 lines belonging to four N2O
   isotopologues (N-14(2) O-16, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O, and 14N2 18O) are
   measured with a position accuracy better than 1 \& times; 10 \& minus;3
   cm \& minus;1 for most of the lines. Line intensities at room
   temperature range between 1.2 \& times; 10 \& minus;25 and 3.8 \& times;
   10 \& minus;30 cm/molecule. The rovibrational assignments were obtained
   by comparison with predictions based on the global modeling of the line
   positions and intensities performed within the framework of the method
   of effective operators. The band-by-band analysis led to the
   determination of the rovibrational parameters of a total of 47 bands.
   All identified bands belong to the AP = 14-16 series of transitions,
   where P = 2 V 1 + V 2 + 4 V 3 is the polyad number (Vi= 1-3 are the
   vibrational quantum numbers). Among these bands, only five were
   previously observed and bands of the AP = 15 series are reported for the
   first time. Local resonance perturbations affecting two bands are
   identified and analyzed. The position and intensity comparisons to the
   HITRAN2016 and HITEMP2019 spectroscopic databases are discussed. The
   HITRAN line list is limited to only four (calculated) bands of the 14N2
   18O isotopologue in the studied region while AP = 15 bands are missing
   in the HITEMP list. The present work will help to improve future
   versions of the spectroscopic databases of nitrous oxide, a strong
   greenhouse gas. }},

Abstract = {{Using frequency-agile rapid scanning cavity ring-down spectroscopy, we
   measured line intensities and line shape parameters of N-14(2) O-16 in
   air in the (4200)<-(0000) and (5000)<-(0000) bands near 1.6 mu m. The
   absorption spectra were modeled with multi-spectrum fits of Voigt and
   speed-dependent Voigt profiles. The measured line intensities and
   air-broadening parameters exhibit deviations of several percent relative
   to values provided in HITRAN 2016. Our measured intensities for these
   two bands have relative combined standard uncertainties of similar to
   1\% which is approximately five times smaller than literature values.
   Comparison of the present air-broadening and speed-dependent broadening
   parameters to experimental literature values for other
   rotation-vibration bands of N2O indicates significant differences in
   magnitude and J-dependence. For applications requiring high spectral
   fidelity, these results suggest that the assumption of band-independent
   line shape parameters is not appropriate. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We present a high-resolution, high-temperature version of the Nitrogen
   Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank called NDSD-1000. The databank contains
   the line parameters (positions, intensities, self-and air-broadening
   coefficients, exponents of the temperature dependence of self-and
   air-broadening coefficients) of the principal isotopologue of NO2. The
   reference temperature for line intensity is 296 K and the intensity
   cutoff is 10(-25) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) at 1000 K. The broadening
   parameters are presented for two reference temperatures 296 K and 1000
   K. The databank has 1,046,808 entries, covers five spectral regions in
   the 466-4776 cm(-1) spectral range and is designed for temperatures up
   to 1000 K. The databank is based on the global modeling of the line
   positions and intensities performed within the framework of the method
   of effective operators. The parameters of the effective Hamiltonian and
   the effective dipole moment operator have been fitted to the observed
   values of the line positions and intensities collected from the
   literature. The broadening coefficients as well as the temperature
   exponents are calculated using the semi-empirical approach. The databank
   is useful for studying high temperature radiative properties of NO2.
