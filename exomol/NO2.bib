  abstract = { Using a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrum recorded at SOLEIL for a rather large value of the (pressure × path length) product a new investigation of the very weak 2ν1 absorption band of nitrogen dioxide, located at 2627.377 cm−1 was performed, together with an extension up to higher N and Ka values of a previous investigation of the strong ν1 + ν3 band [J.-Y. Mandin, V. Dana, A. Perrin, J.-M. Flaud, C. Camy-Peyret, L. Régalia and A. Barbe, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 181, 379 (1997)]. The 2ν1 lines proved to be perturbed by local vibration–rotation resonances which couple the (2,0,0) energy levels with those of the (1,2,0) and (1,0,1) states. Also the (1,0,1) energy levels are also coupled by a C-type Coriolis resonance with those of the (1,2,0) and (2,0,0) energy levels. The final energy levels calculation involves six interacting states of NO2, {(2,0,0), (1,2,0), (1,0,1), (0,0,2), (0,4,0), (0,0,2)}. An estimation of line intensities parameters was performed for the very weak 2ν1 band. Finally a list of line parameters (positions, intensities and shapes) for the 2ν1, ν1 + 2ν2 and ν1 + ν3 bands of NO2, was generated and is now included in the GEISA database (https://geisa.aeris-data.fr/). }}

Abstract = {{We present a high-resolution, high-temperature version of the Nitrogen
   Dioxide Spectroscopic Databank called NDSD-1000. The databank contains
   the line parameters (positions, intensities, self-and air-broadening
   coefficients, exponents of the temperature dependence of self-and
   air-broadening coefficients) of the principal isotopologue of NO2. The
   reference temperature for line intensity is 296 K and the intensity
   cutoff is 10(-25) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) at 1000 K. The broadening
   parameters are presented for two reference temperatures 296 K and 1000
   K. The databank has 1,046,808 entries, covers five spectral regions in
   the 466-4776 cm(-1) spectral range and is designed for temperatures up
   to 1000 K. The databank is based on the global modeling of the line
   positions and intensities performed within the framework of the method
   of effective operators. The parameters of the effective Hamiltonian and
   the effective dipole moment operator have been fitted to the observed
   values of the line positions and intensities collected from the
   literature. The broadening coefficients as well as the temperature
   exponents are calculated using the semi-empirical approach. The databank
   is useful for studying high temperature radiative properties of NO2.
