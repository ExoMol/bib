Abstract = {In this work, spectroscopic parameters and transition properties are
   studied for the X (2)Pi, B (2)Pi, B' 2 Sigma(+), a (4)Pi, and b
   (4)Sigma(-) states of the NS radical. It is found that the rotationless
   radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are approximately several
   is for the B (2)Pi state, in order of 10 ps for the B `Sigma(+) state,
   and 10 to 100 mu s for the b (4)Sigma(-) state. Therefore, vibronic
   emissions originating from them occur readily. The Einstein coefficients
   of the vibronic emissions from the B (2)Pi-X (2)Pi, B `(2)Sigma(+)-X
   (2)Pi, and b (4)Sigma(-)-a (4)Pi are large, indicating that the
   transitions of these systems can be measured readily through
   spectroscopy. The effect of the spin-orbit coupling effect on the
   spectroscopic parameters is evaluated for these five states. The
   splitting energies of the X (2)Pi and B (2)Pi states are 221.67 and
   95.05 cm(-1) at the internuclear equilibrium positions, respectively.
   The transition properties for each pair of Omega states are calculated
   and the results calculated compared with available experimental ones.
   The spectral range of vibronic emissions is determined for the
   transitions of several- pair Omega states},

abstract="Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectra of N32S and N34S have been recorded in the range of 35700--40200 cm−1. The radical was generated by a pulsed dc discharge of a mixture of SF6 and N2 under a supersonic free jet condition. All the 16 observed bands of N32S radicals have been assigned, among which 12 bands belong to three transition progressions (v{\textasciiacutex}=0−4, 0), (v{\textasciiacutex}=1−4, 1) and (v{\textasciiacutex}=2−4, 2) from the X2$\Pi$ ground state to the B{\textasciiacutex}2$\Sigma$+ upper state and the rest correspond to (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0) and (12, 0) bands of B2$\Pi$-X2$\Pi$ transition, respectively. Analysis of the rotationally resolved spectra yields exhaustive spectroscopic constants of both the X2$\Pi$ ground state and the B{\textasciiacutex}2$\Sigma$+ excited state. The electronic transition bands of the isotopic molecule N34S have been rotationally analyzed for the first time and the rotational constants of the ground and upper states have been determined simultaneously.",

abstract = {Highly correlated ab initio methods were used in order to generate
the potential energy functions (PEFs) of the bound electronic states of the
SN − anion and the long-range parts of the PEFs of its excited states and their
mutual spin–orbit couplings. The SN (X 2 Π and a 4 Π) potential energy curves
are also computed. In addition to the two bound electronic states of SN −
(i.e. X 3 Σ − and 1 Δ) already known, our calculations show that the 3 Δ state
is lying energetically below its quartet parent neutral state (a 4 Π).
The depletion of the J = 3 component of SN − ( 3 Δ) will mainly occur via weak
interactions with the electron continuum wave. At large internuclear distances,
SN − ( 5 Π) state is predicted to possess a shallow polarization minimum
supporting long-lived SN − ions. Finally, the reaction between S − ( 2 P u )
and N( 4 S u ) involves the electronic states of SN − and their mutual couplings,
in competition with the autodetachment processes.},
