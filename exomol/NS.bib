Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {230},
Pages = {120-130},
Abstract = {In this work, spectroscopic parameters and transition properties are
   studied for the X (2)Pi, B (2)Pi, B' 2 Sigma(+), a (4)Pi, and b
   (4)Sigma(-) states of the NS radical. It is found that the rotationless
   radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are approximately several
   is for the B (2)Pi state, in order of 10 ps for the B `Sigma(+) state,
   and 10 to 100 mu s for the b (4)Sigma(-) state. Therefore, vibronic
   emissions originating from them occur readily. The Einstein coefficients
   of the vibronic emissions from the B (2)Pi-X (2)Pi, B `(2)Sigma(+)-X
   (2)Pi, and b (4)Sigma(-)-a (4)Pi are large, indicating that the
   transitions of these systems can be measured readily through
   spectroscopy. The effect of the spin-orbit coupling effect on the
   spectroscopic parameters is evaluated for these five states. The
   splitting energies of the X (2)Pi and B (2)Pi states are 221.67 and
   95.05 cm(-1) at the internuclear equilibrium positions, respectively.
   The transition properties for each pair of Omega states are calculated
   and the results calculated compared with available experimental ones.
   The spectral range of vibronic emissions is determined for the
   transitions of several- pair Omega states},

journal = MNRAS,
year = {2016},
volume = {62},
pages = {S253-S273},
abstract = {Several sulphur-bearing species have already been observed in different
families of comets. However, the knowledge on the minor sulphur species is still
limited. The comet's sulphur inventory is closely linked to the pre-solar cloud
and holds important clues to the degree of reprocessing of the material in the
solar nebula and during comet accretion. Sulphur in pre-solar clouds is highly
depleted, which is quite puzzling as the S/O ratio in the diffuse interstellar
medium is cosmic. This work focuses on the abundance of the previously known species
H2S, OCS, SO, S2, SO2 and CS2 in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko measured
by Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis/Double Focusing Mass
Spectrometer between equinox and perihelion 2015. Furthermore, we present the first
detection of S3, S4, CH3SH and C2H6S in a comet, and we determine the elemental
abundance of S/O in the bulk ice of (1.47 ± 0.05) × 10−2. We show that SO is present
in the coma originating from the nucleus, but not CS in the case of 67P, and for
the first time establish that S2 is present in a volatile and a refractory phase.
The derived total elemental sulphur abundance of 67P is in agreement with solar
photospheric elemental abundances and shows no sulphur depletion as reported for
dense interstellar clouds. Also the presence of S2 at heliocentric distances larger
than 3 au indicates that sulphur-bearing species have been processed by radiolysis
in the pre-solar cloud and that at least some of the ice from this cloud has
survived in comets up the present.},

abstract = {We present spatially resolved (~50 pc) imaging of molecular gas species
in the central kiloparsec of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, based on observations
taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. A total of 50 molecular
lines are detected over a 13 GHz bandwidth imaged in the 3 mm band. Unambiguous
identifications are assigned for 27 lines. Based on the measured high CO/C17O isotopic
line ratio (gsim350), we show that 12CO(1-0) has moderate optical depths. A comparison
of the HCN and HCO+ with their 13C-substituted isotopologues shows that the HCN(1-0)
and HCO+(1-0) lines have optical depths at least comparable to CO(1-0). H13CN/H13CO+
(and H13CN/HN13C) line ratios provide tighter constraints on dense gas properties
in this starburst. SiO has elevated abundances across the nucleus. HNCO has the
most distinctive morphology of all the bright lines, with its global luminosity
dominated by the outer parts of the central region. The dramatic variation seen
in the HNCO/SiO line ratio suggests that some of the chemical signatures of shocked
gas are being erased in the presence of dominating central radiation fields (traced
by C2H and CN). High density molecular gas tracers (including HCN, HCO+, and CN)
are detected at the base of the molecular outflow. We also detect hydrogen β recombination
lines that, like their α counterparts, show compact, centrally peaked morphologies,
distinct from the molecular gas tracers. A number of sulfur based species are mapped
(CS, SO, NS, C2S, H2CS, and CH3SH) and have morphologies similar to SiO.},

to the electron detachment process and that the long range parts of the PESs
correlating to the SH− + N, SN− + H, SN + H−, NH + S−, and NH− + S are bound.
In addition, we predict the existence of long-lived weakly bound anionic complexes
that can be formed after cold collisions between SN− and H or SH− and N. The
implications for the reactivity of these species are discussed; specifically,
it is shown that the reactions involving SH−, SN−, and NH− lead either to the
formation of HNS− or HSN− in their electronic ground states or to autodetachment
processes. Thus, providing an explanation for why the anions, SH−, SN−, and NH−,

volume = {450},
pages = {1256-1267},
abstract = {Sulphur appears to be depleted by an order of magnitude or more from its elemental
abundance in star-forming regions. In the last few years, numerous observations
and experiments have been performed in order to understand the reasons behind this
depletion without providing a satisfactory explanation of the sulphur chemistry
towards high-mass star-forming cores. Several sulphur-bearing molecules have been
observed in these regions, and yet none are abundant enough to make up the gas-phase
deficit. Where, then, does this hidden sulphur reside? This paper represents a
step forward in our understanding of the interactions among the various S-bearing
species. We have incorporated recent experimental and theoretical data into a
chemical model of a hot molecular core in order to see whether they give any
indication of the identity of the sulphur sink in these dense regions. Despite
our model producing reasonable agreement with both solid-phase and gas-phase
abundances of many sulphur-bearing species, we find that the sulphur residue
detected in recent experiments takes up only ∼6 per cent of the available sulphur
in our simulations, rather than dominating the sulphur budget.},

formation of N2and SH in the cold interstellar clouds}},
journal = PCCP,

volume = {17},
pages = {32455-32463},
abstract = {Using computational calculations the potential energy surface (PES)
of the reaction between NH and NS has been analysed. The PES of the reaction shows
the formation of two very stable species, HNSN and HNNS. Out of these two, HNNS
which has the signature N–N linkage was found to be the most stable species in the
PES. In view of the highly exothermic nature of the reaction surface, it has been
proposed that these two species can possibly be detected in the interstellar space.
For the first time it has also been shown that the reaction between the NH and NS
can lead to the possible formation of N2via the isomer HNNS, and how the effect
of tunnelling can make this reaction very much feasible, even under the extremely
low temperature conditions prevailing in the interstellar medium. Based on the
already reported results, a similar kind of behaviour for the NH + NO reaction
surface has also been proposed. These dissociation reactions leading to the formation
of N2 can be considered as potential secondary contributing channels while accounting
for the total estimates of N2 in the interstellar medium, and thus HNNS as well
as HNNO can be considered as stable reservoir molecules for interstellar N2.
Besides the formation of N2, the formation of another astronomically important
radical, SH in the cold interstellar clouds, has also been proposed.},

survey of Sagittarius B2(N) and (M)}},
journal = AA,
year = {2013},
volume = {559},
pages = {A47},
abstract = {The discovery of amino acids in meteorites fallen to Earth and the
detection of glycine, the simplest of them, in samples returned from a comet to
Earth strongly suggest that the chemistry of the interstellar medium is capable
of producing such complex organic molecules and that they may be widespread in
our Galaxy. Aims. Our goal is to investigate the degree of chemical complexity
that can be reached in the interstellar medium, in particular in dense star-forming
regions. Methods. We performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward Sgr B2(N)
and (M), two regions where high-mass stars are formed, with the IRAM 30 m telescope
in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window. Partial surveys at 2 and 1.3 mm were
performed in parallel. The spectra were analyzed with a simple radiative transfer
model that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium but takes optical depth effects
into account. Results. About 3675 and 945 spectral lines with a peak signal-to-noise
ratio higher than 4 are detected at 3 mm toward Sgr B2(N) and (M), i.e. about 102
and 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This represents an increase by about a factor
of two over previous surveys of Sgr B2. About 70% and 47% of the lines detected
toward Sgr B2(N) and (M) are identified and assigned to 56 and 46 distinct molecules
as well as to 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these molecules, respectively.
In addition, we report the detection of transitions from 59 and 24 catalog entries
corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited states of some of these molecules,
respectively, up to a vibration energy of 1400 cm-1 (2000 K). Excitation temperatures
and column densities were derived for each species but should be used with caution.
The rotation temperatures of the detected complex molecules typically range
from ~50 to 200 K. Among the detected molecules, aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl
cyanide, and ethyl formate were reported for the first time in space based on
this survey, as were five rare isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene,
and hydrogen cyanide. We also report the detection of transitions from within
twelve new vibrationally or torsionally excited states of known molecules. Absorption
features produced by diffuse clouds along the line of sight are detected in transitions
with low rotation quantum numbers of many simple molecules and are modeled with ~30–40
velocity components with typical linewidths of ~3–5 km s-1. Conclusions. Although
the large number of unidentified lines may still allow future identification of
new molecules, we expect most of these lines to belong to vibrationally or torsionally
excited states or to rare isotopologues of known molecules for which spectroscopic
predictions are currently missing. Significant progress in extending the inventory
of complex organic molecules in Sgr B2(N) and deriving tighter constraints on their
location, origin, and abundance is expected in the near future thanks to an ongoing
spectral line survey at 3 mm with ALMA in its cycles 0 and 1. The present single-dish
survey will serve as a solid basis for the line identification and analysis of such
an interferometric survey.},

SO coupling calculations. To improve the quality of the PECs, core-valence correlation
and relativistic corrections are included. Core-valence correlation corrections
are included with a cc-pCVTZ basis set. Relativistic correction calculations are
carried out using the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the

abstract = {We present the results of a 7 mm spectral survey of molecular absorption
lines originating in the disk of a z = 0.89 spiral galaxy located in front of the
quasar PKS 1830−211. Our survey was performed with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array and covers the frequency interval 30–50 GHz, corresponding to the rest-frame
frequency interval 57–94 GHz. A total of 28 different species, plus 8 isotopic
variants, were detected toward the south-west absorption region, located about 2
kpc from the center of the z = 0.89 galaxy, which therefore has the largest number
of detected molecular species of any extragalactic object so far. The results of
our rotation diagram analysis show that the rotation temperatures are close to the
cosmic microwave background temperature of 5.14 K that we expect to measure at
z = 0.89, whereas the kinetic temperature is one order of magnitude higher, indicating
that the gas is subthermally excited. The molecular fractional abundances are found
to be in-between those in typical Galactic diffuse and translucent clouds, and clearly
deviate from those observed in the dark cloud TMC 1 or in the Galactic center giant
molecular cloud Sgr B2. The isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and silicon
deviate significantly from the solar values, which can be linked to the young age
of the z = 0.89 galaxy and a release of nucleosynthesis products dominated by massive
stars. Toward the north-east absorption region, where the extinction and column
density of gas is roughly one order of magnitude lower than toward the SW absorption
region, only a handful of molecules are detected. Their relative abundances are
comparable to those in Galactic diffuse clouds. We also report the discovery of
several new absorption components, with velocities spanning between  − 300 and +170
km s-1. Finally, the line centroids of several species (e.g., CH3OH, NH3) are
found to be significantly offset from the average velocity. If caused by a variation
in the proton-to-electron mass ratio μ with redshift, these offsets yield an upper
limit |Δμ/μ| < 4×10-6, which takes into account the kinematical noise produced by
the velocity dispersion measured from a large number of molecular species.},

observed the nitrogen monosulfide radical (NS) in Comet Hale-Bopp, through the
rotational transition J = 15/2–13/2, in the vibrational level v″ = 0, of the
fundamental electronic state X2Πr. This was the first time ever that this radical

Until the present time, the lifetime of NS against photodissociation is unknown in
Literature. In order to determine the production rate of this radical they applied
a Haser model, using lifetimes associated to the analogous isoelectronic species NO.
Following Lie et al. [Lie, G.C., Peyerimhoff, S.D., Buenker, R.J. Configuration
interaction studies of low-lying valence and Rydberg states of NS, J. Chem. Phys.,
82, 2672–2678, 1985], the NS radical dissociates for λ = 2305.37 Å, which corresponds
to the (v′ = 0 → v″ = 0) vibrational band of the NS(C2Σ+–X2Πr) electronic system.
Considering the rotational and vibrational constants [Huber, K.P., Herzberg, G.
Constants of Diatomic Molecules, Van Nostrand, New York, 1979] for these electronic
states we determine the associated r-centroids and Franck–Condon factors. With these
values and the electronic transition moments, extrapolated from the values of Lie
et al. [Lie, G.C., Peyerimhoff, S.D., Buenker, R.J. Configuration interaction
studies of low-lying valence and Rydberg states of NS, J. Chem. Phys., 82, 2672–2678, 1985],
we determine the spontaneous emission rates and the absorption oscillator strengths
of several vibrational bands of that electronic system for this species. The Einstein’s
coefficient for absorption of the relevant vibrational band (0, 0), combined with
the solar fluxes (maximum and minimum), for λ = 2305.37 Å and heliocentric distance
rh = 1.0 AU, allowed us to determine the photodissociation rate in this electronic
system and the concerning lifetimes. We also determine the g-factors of fluorescence
efficiency. Finally, with the photodissociation lifetimes and the g-factors for the
NS radical, we re-evaluate the production rate of the species and compare our results
with Irvine et al. [Irvine, W.M., Senay, M., Lovell, A.J. et al. Note: Detection of

 to (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0) and (12, 0) bands of B2$\Pi$-X2$\Pi$ transition, respectively.
 Analysis of the rotationally resolved spectra yields exhaustive spectroscopic
 constants of both the X2$\Pi$ ground state and the B{\textasciiacutex}2$\Sigma$+

 been rotationally analyzed for the first time and the rotational constants of the

are measured through observations of 13CS, C34S, and C33S. A comparison with the
observed relative abundances toward different prototypical Galactic sources suggests
that the chemical composition of NGC 253 is similar to that found toward molecular
cloud complexes like Sgr B2 in the nuclear region of the Milky Way. The large
overabundance of OCS compared with the predictions of time-dependent sulfur chemistry

radicals and ions, plus several isotopologues, were detected, the majority of them
being recently revealed in comets C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake) and C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp).
Among them, 6 molecules were detected for the first time (Bockelée-Morvan et al.
[CITE]) in the course of a spectral survey conducted at radio wavelengths in comet
Hale-Bopp with the CSO, the IRAM 30-m telescope and Plateau de Bure interferometer.
In addition, many species were searched for unsuccessfully, some of them with stringent
upper limits. We present here a review of these observations and further analysis
of their results. This include: (i) confirmed detection of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO); (ii)
limits on small molecules such as ketene (H2CCO) or methanimine (CH2NH); (iii)
limits on the abundance ratios in homologous series such as HC5N/HC3N, ethanol/methanol,
acetic acid/formic acid; (iv) searches for precursors of key cometary species such
as atomic Na and HNC; (v) constraints on more exotic species ranging from water
dimer (H2O)2 to glycine; (vi) detection of the HS isotopic species and independent
observations of HDO and DCN; (vii) limits on several other deuterated species; (viii)
limits on several radicals and ions and a tentative detection of the C2H radical;
(ix) the presence of unidentified lines. Typical abundance upper limits of 2–5
relative to water are achieved for many species. Better upper limits are obtained
for some linear molecules with high dipole moments. But more complex molecules
such as dimethyl ether or glycine are poorly constrained. These results should
give important clues to the chemical composition of cometary ices, to the formation
mechanisms of cometary material, and to the chemical processes which occur in the

abstract = {The most fundamental scientific reason for studying comets is to
retrieve information on their origin, relationship to interstellar and interplanetary
material and implication for the formation of the Solar System or Cosmogony. The
determination of the basic parameters of the nucleus and its activity and comp
osition is desirable in order to establish a consistent database for comparative
studies of comets and, as such, is vital for the safety and success of space missions.
The objective of the present work is to contribute to the establishment of a unique
description of the physical-chemical nature of the nucleus. We study carbon monosulfide
(CS) - which is the only sulfur compound that persistently appears in cometary
ultraviolet spectra and, therefore, seems to play a key role in sulfur photochemistry
in cometary comae - and nitrogen monosulfide (NS) - the first cometary molecular
species to contain both nitrogen and sulfur atoms which was recently observed by
Irvine et al. (2000) in comet Hale -Bopp. The determination of the abundance of
each such species helps to constrain the chemistry and physics of comets and hence
their place and mode of origin of the nucleus. With this purpose in mind we have
developed a multifluid chemical model of cometary comae (Boice 1990) with gas-phase
chemical kinetics and gas dynamics to predict molecular abundance variations in a
sensitive manner with cometocentric distance. We apply the model to the recent bright
comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp at a heliocentric distance of 1 AU to study the
abundances of CS and NS in their comae using a detailed photo and chemical reaction
network with more than 100 species and over 1000 reactions. We conclude that the
CS abundance in comets does not seem to vary much with the cometocentric distance.
In particular, if NS is the daughter of an unknown long-lived parent molecular
species, its production rate and abundance should be much larger than the obtained
values. These results should be helpful in interpreting results from recent
spacecraft missions and in planning future ones.},

abstract = {The characteristic chemistry of hot cores arises from the abrupt
evaporation of icy mantles when a massive star begins to irradiate the interstellar
gas in its vicinity. Such stars are also likely to generate powerful winds which
may initiate shocks in the same interstellar gas. In this paper, we consider whether
chemical signatures of the passage of a shock through a hot core can be identified.
We find that if hydrogenation occurs on surfaces and freeze-out of heavy gas-phase
atoms and molecules is complete before the hot core is established then no such
chemical signature exists. However, if some residual material is present in the
gas when the hot core is established then the following molecular abundance ratios
are significantly affected by the presence of a shock: NS/CS, SO/CS, and HCO/H2CO.
This result is more evident if injection of ices into the gas occurs over a finite
period, rather than instantaneously. We conclude that these molecular abundance
ratios may be useful tracers of the dynamical history of hot cores, and that follow-up
observational studies are required.},

report the first detection of NS in circumstellar envelopes. The overall distribution
of the emission of all molecules (except for HCO+ and the SiO maser) is similar
to that of CO. The most intense emission arises from a compact, slowly-expanding
component around the central star. The rest of the emission comes from gas distributed
in a narrow region along the symmetry axis, that flows outwards following a
velocity gradient also similar to that found in CO. Our observations show with
high accuracy the distribution of the HCO+ intensity, that is found to be very
clumpy and strongly enhanced in the shock-accelerated lobes. We argue that such
a distribution is due to the efficient formation of this molecule by shock-induced
reactions. An expanding disk or ring around the central star is detected from the
SO emission. The characteristic radius and expansion velocity of this structure
are 2 1016 cm and 6-7 km s-1, respectively. The SiO maser emission could arise
from the innermost parts of such a disk. The 3 mm continuum emission seems to be
due to cold dust (~ 20 K) distributed in the lobes of object {OH 231.8+4.2} as

where it was the object of extensive observations. It was thus possible to study
these two exceptional comets with modern instrumentation covering the electromagnetic
spectrum from radio to X-ray domains. Our knowledge of the composition and nature
of comets has been transformed. New cometary molecules were observed, as well as
isotopic species. New physical processes could be studied, owing to the large
amounts of matter escaping from these objects, to the proximity of Earth allowing
a detailed investigation of the region close to the nucleus (comet Hyakutake), or
to the unusual physical conditions far from the Sun (comet Hale–Bopp). Selected

toward 12 of 14 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) observed. Analysis of the hyperfine
component relative line strengths suggests that NS emission is optically thin toward
these sources, with the possible exception of Sgr B2(M). The fractional abundance
of NS relative to molecular hydrogen is best defined for the Orion molecular cloud,
where it is typically (1-4) × 10-10, which is about an order of magnitude larger
than found by some recent gas-phase chemistry models developed for quiescent clouds.
Toward OMC-1, the NS integrated intensity is strongly peaked toward KL, but also
extends all along the Orion ridge, resembling the distribution of SO and CH3OH.
We have identified a spectral feature seen toward several sources as the ortho-NKK
= 404 → 313, J = 3 → 2, fine-structure component of methylene (CH2; cf. Hollis,
Jewell, & Lovas). We also report the first detection of the SO+2Π1/2, J = 3/2 → 1/2,

abstract = {We present a high-sensitivity spectral line survey of the high-mass
star-forming region Orion KL in the 325-360 GHz frequency band. The survey was
conducted at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The
sensitivity achieved is typically 0.1-0.5 K and is limited mostly by the sideband
separation method utilized. We find 717 resolvable features consisting of 1004 lines,
among which 60 are unidentified. The identified lines are due to 34 species and
various isotopomers. Most of the unidentified lines are weak, and many of them most
likely due to isotopomers or vibrationally or torsionally excited states of known
species with unknown line frequencies, but a few reach the 2-5 K level. No new
species have been identified, but we were able to strengthen evidence for the
identification of ethanol in Orion and found the first nitrogen sulfide line in
this source. The molecule dominating the integrated line emission is SO2, which
emits twice the intensity of CO, followed by SO, which is only slightly stronger
than CO. In contrast, the largest number of lines is emitted from heavy organic
rotors like HCOOCH3, CH3CH2CN, and CH3OCH3, but their contribution to the total
flux is unimportant. CH3OH is also very prominent, both in the number of lines
and in integrated flux. An interesting detail of this survey is the first detection
of vibrationally excited HCN in the v2 = 2 state, 2000 K above ground. Clearly
this is a glimpse into the very inner part of the Orion hot core.},

abstract = {We present here a review of the radio observations of the remarkable
comet Hale-Bopp C/1995 O1 in which most major radio astronomical facilities have
been involved. These observations started in August 1995, soon after the discovery
of the comet (it was then at ∼7 AU from the sun), and well before its perihelion
on April 1st, 1997; they are still going on, hopefully up to end of 1998. Extended
cartographies have been obtained using multibeam receivers and on-the-fly techniques.
High spatial resolution (a few ″) has been achieved with interferometers.
Submillimetric observations are playing an increasing role, and high resolution
(R ∼ 106−107) spectroscopy of cometary lines is now performed from decimetric to
submillimetric wavelengths. The number of species observed at radio wavelengths
now reaches ∼28,when it was ∼14 for comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake. Most of these species
are parent molecules. However, ions have been observed for the first time at radio
wavelengths, and their velocities measured. Several isotopic species (involving
D,13C,34S,15N) have been sought, allowing isotopic enrichment determinations.
The abundances of cometary molecules present many similarities and some differences
with the abundances of interstellar molecules in regions where grain mantles are
believed to be evaporated to the gas phase (hot cores, bipolar flows). They will
be discussed for their implications on the origin of cometary ices and of comets
themselves.},

is very similar to that observed in quiescent interstellar molecular clouds, and
quite different from the equilibrium ratio expected in the outermost solar nebula,
where comets are thought to form. Such a departure from equilibrium has long been
considered a hallmark of gas-phase chemical processing in the interstellar medium7,
suggesting that interstellar gases have been incorporated into the comet's nucleus,
perhaps as ices frozen onto interstellar grains. If this interpretation is correct,
our results should provide constraints on the temperature of the solar nebula, and
the subsequent chemical processes that occurred in the region where comets formed.},

whether it is necessary to invoke surface reactions on grains to match the observed

provide a good test of the models of the coupled chemistry of nitrogen and sulfur.

of the more than 780 lines remain unidentified, of which 16 occur in the upper

attributed to HCS, a radical not previously detected, and the assignment is based
mainly on chemical evidence at this stage.},

the dominant perturbing state is a 2Σ− state not identified yet. Relative magnitudes
of hyperfine constants of NS are very similar to those of NO, although their absolute
values in the former are consistently smaller than in the latter. The rotational

Measurements made on the heads of some of these weak bands ledBarrow et al. to
believe that these bands may form a system analogous to theβ-system of NO and be
due to a2П-2П transition. The spectrum of NS has now been studied in a little more
detail by means of an uncondensed discharge through dry nitrogen and sulphur vapour
in the presence of argon and thirty three bands belonging to this system have been
recorded in the region 2280 to 2760 Å. It has been found possible to represent the
band heads by means of the equation
vhead = 43311⋅543182⋅5+[761⋅04(v′+12)−5⋅10(v′+12)2]−[1219⋅20(v′′+12)−7⋅48(v′′+12)2].
Taking the lower state doublet interval as 223 cm−1, it is shown that the separation
in the upper state is 94 cm−1. The ratio of the force constants in the upper and
the ground states is found to be 0·39 and is nearly the same as that in theβ-system
of NO (0·30). The present vibrational analysis therefore supports the view that
these new red degraded bands of NS arise from a (B2П→X2П) transition and the observed
intensity distribution in the form of a wide parabola is also in qualitative
agreement with what is expected from the moderately largeΔ re (∼0·12Å) value.},

abstract = {The present investigation had its origin in an observation by one
of us that in a vacuum tube containing sulphur vapour with an impurity of nitrogen,
there appeared a previously unrecorded band spectrum which bore a striking resemblance
to that of nitric oxide (NO). As only sulphur and nitrogen were known to be present,
this similarity suggested that the new spectrum might be due to nitrogen sulphide
(NS), since oxygen and sulphur have the same number of valence electrons. This
supposition appears to be fully confirmed by the further experiments which have
been made and by the vibrational analysis of the bands. The principal members of
both sets of bands occur in the ultra-violet and nearly in the same region. It
will be convenient first to give a brief account of the bands of nitric oxide.
The Bands of Nitric Oxide. The principal bands of NO are well known from their
occurrence in air vacuum tubes; they were long ago named the “Third Positive Bands
of Nitrogen” by Deslandres, who, nevertheless, considered that the presence of
both nitrogen and oxygen was necessary for their production. These bands were
observed by Fowler and Strutt (now Lord Rayleigh) to appear in the spectrum of
the nitrogen afterglow, and the opinion was expressed that nitrogen alone was
capable of producing them. Subsequent work by Lewis and by Strutt,§ however,
supported the view that the bands were produced only when both nitrogen and oxygen
were present. During the present investigation, also, it has been found that the
bands in question do not occur in vacuum tubes containing nitrogen when oxygen has
been completely removed. These experimental results are in agreement with the
conclusion derived from analyses of the band structure that the bands originate
in the diatomic molecule NO},
