Volume = {129},
Pages = {193-198},
Abstract = {The low-lying electronic states (X-2 Pi, a(4)Pi, b(4)Sigma(-), B-2 Pi,
   1(2)Phi, A(2)Delta and B'(2)Sigma(+)) of the NS molecule are computed at
   the AV5Z/CASSCF/MRCI+Q+DK level of theory. The potential energy curves
   are presented for these states; the corresponding spectroscopic
   constants are reported. Electronic transition moment functions, Einstein
   coefficients, Franck-Condon factors and radiative lifetimes for the B-2
   Pi-X-2 Pi, B'(2)Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi and A(2)Delta-X-2 Pi system have been
   calculated. The F-C factors of the (BII)-I-2 are in good agreement with
   the corresponding RKR data. The B'(2)Sigma(+) state possesses a barrier
   in the potential energy curve, located at about 2.16 angstrom. The
   height of the barrier is predicted to be 7890 cm(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Spin-orbit splitting in the X-2 Pi, a(4)Pi, B-2 Pi and H-2 Pi electronic
   states of the NS radical},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of ten Omega states (X-2 Pi(1/2,3/2),
   a(4)Pi(1/2,1/2,3/2,5/2), B-2 Pi(1/2,3/2) and H-2 Pi(1/2,3/2)) generated
   from four Lambda-S states (X-2 Pi, a(4)Pi, B-2 Pi and H-2 Pi) of the NS
   radical are studied in detail for the first time using an ab initio
   quantum chemical method. All the PEC calculations are performed for
   internuclear separations from 0.10 to 1.11 nm by the complete active
   space self-consistent field method followed by the internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction approach with the Davidson
   modifications (MRCI + Q). The spin-orbit coupling (SO) effect is
   accounted for by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. To discuss the effect on
   the energy splitting by the core-electron correlations, two all-electron
   basis sets, cc-pCVTZ and cc-pVTZ, are used for the SO coupling
   calculations. To improve the quality of the PECs, core-valence
   correlation and relativistic corrections are included. Core-valence
   correlation corrections are included with a cc-pCVTZ basis set.
   Relativistic correction calculations are carried out using the
   third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a
   cc-pV5Z basis set. The spectroscopic parameters of four Lambda-S states
   and ten Omega states are calculated. Excellent agreement is found
   between the present results and the measurements. Using the PECs
   obtained by the MRCI + Q/AV5Z+ CV + DK + SO calculations, the
   G(upsilon), B-upsilon and D-upsilon are calculated for each vibrational
   state of each Omega state, and those of the first 30 vibrational states
   are reported for the X-2 Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2), B-2 Pi(1/2) and B-2
   Pi(3/2) states of the (NS)-N-14-S-32 radical. The spectroscopic
   parameters of four Omega states of the a(4)Pi and the G(upsilon),
   B-upsilon and D-upsilon of the X-2 Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2), B-2 Pi(1/2) and
   B-2 Pi(3/2) states reported here are expected to be reliable predicted
   results.},

	Abstract = {We report the first detections of SO2, NS and NO in an extragalactic source, the nucleus of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. Five SO2 transitions, three groups of hyperfine components of NO and five of NS were detected. All three species show large abundances averaged over the inner 200 pc of NGC 253. With a relative abundance of a few 10(-7), the emission of the NO molecule is similar or even larger than that found in Galactic star forming regions. The derived relative molecular abundances for each molecule have been compared with those of prototypical Galactic molecular clouds. These results seem to confirm that large scale shocks dominate the chemistry of these molecules in the nucleus of NGC 253, ruling out a chemistry dominated by PDRs for the bulk of the gas.},

	Abstract = {We report a survey for nitrogen sulfide (NS) toward regions of massive star formation. NS was observed by means of its (II1/2)-I-2, J = 3/2 --> 1/2, J = 5/2 --> 3/2, and J = 7/2 --> 5/2 transitions at 69, 115, and 161 GHz, respectively, and was detected toward 12 of 14 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) observed. Analysis of the hyperfine component relative line strengths suggests that NS emission is optically thin toward these sources, with the possible exception of Sgr B2(M). The fractional abundance of NS relative to molecular hydrogen is best defined for the Orion molecular cloud, where it is typically (1-4) x 10(-10) which is about an order of magnitude larger than found by some recent gas-phase chemistry models developed for quiescent clouds. Toward OMC-1, the NS integrated intensity is strongly peaked toward KL, but also extends all along the Orion ridge, resembling the distribution of SO and CH3OH. We have identified a spectral feature seen toward several sources as the ortho-N-KK = 4(04) --> 3(13), J = 3 --> 2, fine-structure component of methylene (CH2; cf Hollis, Jewell, & Lovas). We also report the first detection of the SO+ 2II(1/2), J = 3/2 - 1/2, parity-e transition toward WS1(MS) and L134N.},
