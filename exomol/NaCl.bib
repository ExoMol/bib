	The J = 7 --> 6, 11 --> 10, 12 --> 11, and 18 --> 17 transitions
	of NaCl at 1, 2, and 3 mm have been observed, as well as the J =
	8 --> 7 line of the Cl-37 isotopomer. The J = 12 --> 11 line was
	also measured at the ARO 12 m telescope. An unsuccessful search was
	additionally conducted for AlCl toward CRL 2688, although in the
	process new transitions of NaCN were observed. Both NaCl and NaCN
	were found to be present in the AGB remnant wind, as suggested by
	their U-shaped line profiles, indicative of emission arising from
	an optically thin, extended shell-like source of radius similar to10{''}-12{''}.
	These data contrast with past results in IRC + 10216, where the distribution
	of both molecules is confined to within a few arcseconds of the star.
	A high degree of excitation is required for the transitions observed
	for NaCl and NaCN; therefore, these two species likely arise in the
	region where the high-velocity outflow has collided with the remnant
	wind. Here the effects of shocks and clumping due to Rayleigh-Taylor
	instabilities have raised the densities and temperatures significantly.
	The shell source is thus likely to be clumpy and irregular. The chemistry
	producing the sodium compounds is consequently more complex than
	simple LTE formation. Abundances of NaCl and NaCN, relative to H-2,
	are f similar to 1.6 x 10(-10) and similar to 5.2 x 10(-9), respectively,
	while the upper limit to AlCl is f < 2 x 10(-9). These values differ
	substantially from those in IRC + 10216, where AlCl has an abundance
	near 10(-7). The NaCl observations additionally indicate a chlorine
	isotope ratio of Cl-35/Cl-37 = 2.1 +/- 0.8 in CRL 2688, suggestive
	of s-process enhancement of chlorine 37.},

	initio calculations based on quantum chemical methods and the one-center
	approximation were used to compute the Cl L2,3VV AES. The vibrational
	band structure in the AES was simulated by full life time vibrational
	interference (LVI) theory and a more approximate moment method. Calculations
	were compared with the corresponding experimental electron or photon
	impact excited spectra. Overall features and changes in the series
	of the experimental AES are correctly predicted by the theory. For
	the most intense transitions in these spectra a qualitative explanation
	of the energies is given on the basis of a model that includes electrostatic
	interactions, Pauli repulsion, and polarization. This explains that
	the substantial changes of the spectra with X are due to a R-3 dependence
	of the electrostatic interaction on the X-Cl bond length. A comparison
	of the two theoretical methods shows that the LVI vibrational band
	breadths are well reproduced by the moment method in the AES of HCl,
	DCl, and LiCl, whereas the moment breadths are underestimated in
	the AES of NaCl and KCl. The LVI band breadths for HCl, DCl, and
	KCl are in good agreement with experimental data. In contrast, the
	experimental spectra for LiCl and NaCl show almost two times broader
	vibrational bands than predicted by the LVI theory. This contradiction
	indicates that the LiCl and NaCl vapors are contaminated by the dimer
	form of these substances. A large contribution of Li2Cl2 (74\%) and
	Na2Cl2 (29\%) was measured in the LiCl and NaCl vapors by time-of-flight

	and at meetings concerning the validity and physical significance
	of two different approaches for the reduction of a set of diatomic
	molecule data to a compact set of parameters defining a potential
	energy curve and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) radial functions.
	This paper explains the apparent discrepancies between an algebraic
	method championed by J.F. Ogilvie and a numerical method pioneered
	by J.A. Coxon. It confirms the validity of the central underlying
	assumption of both approaches, namely, that spectroscopic data for
	one or multiple isotopomers can be reduced accurately to a compact
	set of parameters characterizing the potential energy and BOB radial
	functions, and it shows that the values of those parameters should
	not depend on which method is used to determine them. The previously
	reported discrepancies arose because of a truncation convention applied
	in Ogilvie's algebraic RADIATOM code. Because of that convention,
	eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation generated using published
	potential energy and BOB functions determined using RADIATOM will
	not accurately reproduce the input data used in the analyses. However,
	if that truncation convention is not applied and the Dunham-type
	expansions are summed to convergence, algebraic analyses yield results
	essentially identical to those obtained from direct numerical-fit
	methods. Tests reported herein also support Watson's {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc.

	have been determined by gas-phase electron diffraction supplemented
	with data from microwave spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.
	Root-mean-square amplitudes of vibration (u) and distance corrections
	(r(a) - r(e)) have been calculated explicitly from the ab initio
	potential-energy surfaces corresponding to the vibrational modes
	of the monomer and dimer. These u and (r(a) - r(e)) values essentially
	include all of the effects associated with large-amplitude modes
	of vibration and anharmonicity; using them we have been able to relate
	the r(a) distances from a gas-phase electron diffraction experiment
	directly to the r(e) distances from ab initio calculations. Vibrational
	amplitudes and distance corrections are compared with those obtained
	by previous methods using both purely harmonic force fields and those

  abstract = {Many of the key properties of Io's atmosphere, such as its spatial
	distribution, temperature, column density and composition, are still
	not fully assessed despite decades of extensive observations. The
	contribution of the possible gas sources to the atmospheric replenishment
	are then still unclear. This paper presents disk-resolved observations
	performed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 345 GHz of atmospheric
	rotational lines of the main atmospheric species SO2, and, for the
	first time, of the minor species SO and NaCl All these species appear
	concentrated on the anti-jovian hemisphere, but do not share the
	same spatial distribution. The obtained maps and line-averaged fluxes
	are compared to realistic models simulating gas sources including
	volcanic plume outgassing, SO2 frost sublimation and photolysis.
	Arguments in favor of each sources are examined and compared to observations,
	putting constraints on their relative roles for each species. While
	sublimation clearly appears as the favored major source for SO2,
	SO2 photolysis may account for most of the production of SO. Using
	constraints on the volcanic plumes distribution from Galileo results,
	we find that direct volcanic input can only contribute for a minor
	fraction of atmospheric SO2, but represent a more significant source
	for SO atmosphere, and is likely to be the only source for NaCl.
	Temperature and column densities findings are also presented for
	SO2, and compare well to previously published observations and atmospheric
	models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
