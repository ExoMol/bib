Title = {{The unusual 3D distribution of NaCl around the asymptotic giant branch
   star IK Tau}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {678},
Abstract = {Context. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is a diatomic molecule with a large
   dipole moment, which allows for its detection even at relatively low
   abundances. It has been detected towards several evolved stars,
   including the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star IK Tau, around which it
   is distributed in several clumps that lie off-centre from the star.Aims.
   We aim to study the 3D distribution of NaCl around the AGB star IK Tau
   and determine the abundance of NaCl relative to H-2 for each of the
   clumps.Methods. First, a new value for the maximum expansion velocity
   was determined. The observed ALMA channel maps were then de-projected to
   create a 3D model of the distribution of NaCl. This model was then used
   as input for the radiative transfer modelling code Magritte. We
   determined the NaCl abundances of each of the clumps by comparing the
   observations with the results of the Magritte simulations.Results. We
   derive an updated value for the maximum expansion velocity of IK Tau:
   upsilon(exp) = 28.4 +/- 1.7 km s(-1). A spiral-like shape can be
   discerned in our 3D distribution model of NaCl. This spiral lies more or
   less in the plane of the sky, with the distribution flatter in the
   line-of-sight direction than in the plane of the sky. We find clump
   abundances of between 9 x 10(-9) and 5 x 10(-8) relative to H-2; the
   relative abundance is typically lower for clumps closer to the star.
   Conclusions. This is the first time de-projection has been used to
   understand the 3D environment of molecular emission around an AGB star
   and to calculate the fractional abundance of NaCl in clumps surrounding
   the star.},

Title = {Salt-bearing Disk Candidates around High-mass Young Stellar Objects},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {942},
Abstract = {Molecular lines tracing the orbital motion of gas in a well-defined disk
   are valuable tools for inferring both the properties of the disk and the
   star it surrounds. Lines that arise only from a disk, and not also from
   the surrounding molecular cloud core that birthed the star or from the
   outflow it drives, are rare. Several such emission lines have recently
   been discovered in one example case, those from NaCl and KCl salt
   molecules. We studied a sample of 23 candidate high-mass young stellar
   objects (HMYSOs) in 17 high-mass star-forming regions to determine how
   frequently emission from these species is detected. We present five new
   detections of water, NaCl, KCl, PN, and SiS from the innermost regions
   around the objects, bringing the total number of known briny disk
   candidates to nine. Their kinematic structure is generally disk-like,
   though we are unable to determine whether they arise from a disk or
   outflow in the sources with new detections. We demonstrate that these
   species are spatially coincident in a few resolved cases and show that
   they are generally detected together, suggesting a common origin or
   excitation mechanism. We also show that several disks around HMYSOs
   clearly do not exhibit emission in these species. Salty disks are
   therefore neither particularly rare in high-mass disks, nor are they
   ubiquitous.},

	first time, of the minor species SO and NaCl All these species appear

	are compared to realistic models simulating gas sources including
	volcanic plume outgassing, SO2 frost sublimation and photolysis.
	Arguments in favor of each sources are examined and compared to observations,
	putting constraints on their relative roles for each species. While
	sublimation clearly appears as the favored major source for SO2,
	SO2 photolysis may account for most of the production of SO. Using
	constraints on the volcanic plumes distribution from Galileo results,
	we find that direct volcanic input can only contribute for a minor

abstract = {A novel method has been developed to allow the accurate determination
	of equilibrium gas-phase structures from experimental data, thus
	allowing direct comparison with theory. This new method is illustrated
	through the example of sodium chloride vapor at 943 K. Using this
	approach the equilibrium structures of the monomer (NaCl) and the
	dimer (Na2Cl2), together with the fraction of vapor existing as dimer,
	have been determined by gas-phase electron diffraction supplemented
	with data from microwave spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.
	Root-mean-square amplitudes of vibration (u) and distance corrections
	(r(a) - r(e)) have been calculated explicitly from the ab initio
	potential-energy surfaces corresponding to the vibrational modes
	of the monomer and dimer. These u and (r(a) - r(e)) values essentially
	include all of the effects associated with large-amplitude modes
	of vibration and anharmonicity; using them we have been able to relate
	the r(a) distances from a gas-phase electron diffraction experiment
	directly to the r(e) distances from ab initio calculations. Vibrational
	amplitudes and distance corrections are compared with those obtained
	by previous methods using both purely harmonic force fields and those

	discussed. The gas-phase equilibrium structural parameters are r(e)(Na-Cl)(monomer)

	with high-level ab initio calculations and are substantially more
	precise than those obtained in previous structural studies.},

	This paper explains the apparent discrepancies between an algebraic

	assumption of both approaches, namely, that spectroscopic data for

	in Ogilvie's algebraic RADIATOM code. Because of that convention,
	eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation generated using published
	potential energy and BOB functions determined using RADIATOM will

	These data contrast with past results in IRC + 10216, where the distribution

	A high degree of excitation is required for the transitions observed

	the Cologne terahertz spectrometer. A total of 189 new rotational
	lines have been measured in the frequency region between 200 and
	930 GHz. Twenty nine of these transitions are assigned for (NaCl)-Cl-35
	to the vibrational ground state with J less than or equal to 72,
	and 102 lines arise from vibrationally excited states up to the 5(th)
	vibrational state: v = 5. For (NaCl)-Cl-37 a total of 58 rotational
	lines with J less than or equal to 76 and v < 4 could be detected.
	The newly measured lines were fitted together with the published
	microwave and millimeter-wave transitions to obtain a refined and
	extended set of molecular parameters: (NaCl)-Cl-35 : B, 6513.04908(41)
	MHz, D-0 = 9.338978(141) kHz, H-0 = -1.0433(144) mHz and (NaCl)-Cl-37
	: B-0 6373.74158(66) MHz, D-0 = 8.943327(185) kHz, H-0 = -0.9623(162)
	mHz. From the experimental data the equilibrium constants B-e, alpha,
	gamma, D-e, beta, delta, H-e, and epsilon are calculated as well.
	The refined parameters for both isotopomers allow precise frequency
	predictions to be made far into the terahertz region. Thus this new
	and highly precise data set for NaCl is intended to support future
	astrophysical observations.},

	initio calculations based on quantum chemical methods and the one-center
	approximation were used to compute the Cl L2,3VV AES. The vibrational
	band structure in the AES was simulated by full life time vibrational
	interference (LVI) theory and a more approximate moment method. Calculations
	were compared with the corresponding experimental electron or photon
	impact excited spectra. Overall features and changes in the series
	of the experimental AES are correctly predicted by the theory. For
	the most intense transitions in these spectra a qualitative explanation
	of the energies is given on the basis of a model that includes electrostatic
	interactions, Pauli repulsion, and polarization. This explains that
	the substantial changes of the spectra with X are due to a R-3 dependence
	of the electrostatic interaction on the X-Cl bond length. A comparison
	of the two theoretical methods shows that the LVI vibrational band
	breadths are well reproduced by the moment method in the AES of HCl,
	DCl, and LiCl, whereas the moment breadths are underestimated in
	the AES of NaCl and KCl. The LVI band breadths for HCl, DCl, and
	KCl are in good agreement with experimental data. In contrast, the
	experimental spectra for LiCl and NaCl show almost two times broader
