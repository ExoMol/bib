Abstract = {Accurate rotation-vibration line lists for two molecules, NaCl and KCl,
   in their ground electronic states are presented. These line lists are
   suitable for temperatures relevant to exoplanetary atmospheres and cool
   stars (up to 3000 K). Isotopologues (NaCl)-Na-23-Cl-35,
   (NaCl)-Na-23-Cl-37, (KCl)-K-39-Cl-35, (KCl)-K-39-Cl-37, (KCl)-K-41-Cl-35
   and (KCl)-K-41-Cl-37 are considered. Laboratory data were used to refine
   ab initio potential energy curves in order to compute accurate
   ro-vibrational energy levels. Einstein A coefficients are generated
   using newly determined ab initio dipole moment curves calculated using
   the CCSD(T) method. New Dunham Y-ij constants for KCl are generated by a
   re-analysis of a published Fourier transform infrared emission spectra.
   Partition functions plus full line lists of ro-vibration transitions are
   made available in an electronic form as supplementary data to this paper
   and at www.exomol.com.},
