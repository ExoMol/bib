Abstract = {{Rotation-vibration line lists for (NaF)-Na-23-F-19, (KF)-K-39-F-19, and
   (KF)-K-41-F-19 in their ground electronic states are presented.
   Experimental data previously collected for infrared transitions up to
   nu=8 and nu=9 for KF {[}1] and NaF {[}2], respectively, and for pure
   rotational transitions have been used to construct potential energy
   curves to yield ro-vibrational energy levels. Dipole moment functions
   were generated from ab initio calculations using the SA-CASSCF and ACPF
   methods. Full line lists and partition functions are made available as
   supplementary data.}},
