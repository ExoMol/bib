	static electronic and vibrational contributions to these properties
	are presented. The vibrational properties have been analysed into
	contributions due to zero-point vibrational averaging and pure vibrational
	terms. An alternative dissection of the vibrational properties into
	nuclear relaxation and curvature terms has also been considered.
	KH has been selected as a model system to study how the number of
	electrons, which are correlated (2, 10 and 20) affect both electronic
	and vibrational properties. The 10 electron approximation gives results
	that are practically the same as those computed by taking into account
	all 20 electrons of KH. The double-harmonic approximation has been
	shown to give satisfactory results for the pure vibrational contributions
	to the polarizability and the first hyperpolarizability, while this
	approximation is useful for demonstrating, qualitatively, the significance
	of the pure vibrational contributions to the second hyperpolarizability.
	In many cases the vibrational contributions are rather small percentages
	of the corresponding electronic contribution. However, several exceptions
	to the above observation have been noted. In all the cases considered
	the vibrational properties should be computed if reasonably accurate
	property values are sought. Electron correlation is important for
	both electronic and vibrational contributions to the electrical properties
	of the hydrides considered. The results are in satisfactory agreement
	with most of the best theoretical and experimental data concerning
	bond lengths, vibrational frequencies and electrical properties.},

  pages = {543-556},
  abstract = {Obtaining ultracold samples of dipolar molecules is a current challenge,
	which requires an accurate knowledge of their electronic properties
	to guide the ongoing experiments. Alkali hydride molecules have permanent
	dipole moments significantly larger than those of mixed alkali species,
	and, as pointed out by Taylor-Juarros et al. (Eur. Phys. J. D, 31,
	213 (2004)) and by Juarros et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 73, 041403 (2006)),
	are thus good candidates for cold molecule formation. In this paper,
	using a standard quantum chemistry approach based on pseudopotentials
	for atomic core representation, large Gaussian basis sets, and effective
	core polarization potential, we systematically investigate the electronic
	properties of the alkali hydrides LiH to CsH, to discuss general
	trends of their behavior. We computed (for the first time for NaH,
	KH, RbH, and CsH) the variation of their static polarizability with
	the internuclear distance. Moreover, in addition to potential curves,
	we determine accurate values of permanent and transition dipole moments
	for ground and excited states depending on the internuclear distance.
	The electronic properties of all alkali hydrides are compared with
	one another, in the light of the numerous other data available in
	the literature. Finally, the influence of the quality of the representation
	of the hydrogen electronic affinity in the approach on the results
	is discussed.},

  abstract = {We show that the de-excitation to different vibrational levels of
	the ground state in NaH molecule can be controlled by using two delayed
	ultrashort pulses ( 4 fs Gaussian). A vibrational wave packet generated
	on the excited A(1)Sigma(+) state by the first pulse is de-excited
	back to the ground state by a second pulse after a time delay. The
	cross-section for de-excitation of the wave packet to different vibrational
	levels of the ground electronic state can be controlled by controlling
	the delay time between the two pulses as well as by choosing a pulse
	duration much shorter than the vibrational period of the molecule,
	such that the de-excited wave packet remains localized in the Franck-Condon
	region of a particular vibrational level of the ground state. Hence,
	the de-excitation to a particular vibrational level can be enhanced
	by suppressing that in others. In spite of the large bandwidth of
	the pulse which includes nine vibrational levels of the upper state
	and five vibrational levels of the ground state, one can selectively
	de-excite the molecule to any one or two vibrational levels of the
	ground state by carefully choosing the delay time between the pulses
	and the pulse duration. We are designing the wave packet in the ground
	state by two short pulses and selectively distributing the population
	in one or two levels at various values of the delay time. In light
	molecules having small vibrational period, this selectivity in de-excitation
	to one or two vibrational levels in the ground state can be achieved
	only by using ultrashort ( 4 fs) pulses in the presence of which
	the localization of the wave packet in the Franck-Condon region of
	the vibrational levels are particularly possible. It has been shown
	that the de-excitation cross-section to a particular vibrational

	transitions of a number of molecular species in the atmospheres of
	Jupiter and Saturn in all available submillimeter atmospheric windows
	between 300 and 1000 GHz (1000 and 300 mu m). The molecules which
	were searched for include the saturated molecules PH3 and H2S, the
	hydrogen halides HCl and HBr, and the alkali hydrides LiH and NaH,
	as well as HCN and HCP. A strong absorption feature at 800.5 GHz
	corresponding to the J = 3-2 transition of PH3 was detected in both
	Jupiter and Saturn, but the detailed analysis of these results will
	be presented elsewhere. A feature coincident with the J = 1-0 transition
	of HCl was also tentatively observed in Saturn. No other molecules
	were detected in either planet, setting stringent limits on most
	of the species listed above. Our measurements set an upper limit
	of 0.3 ppb on the HCN mole fraction in Jupiter if HCN is distributed
	with a constant mixing ratio. This concentration is significantly
	lower than the purported infrared detection of Tokunaga et al. (1981).
	A conservative upper limit of 0.4 ppb is obtained for Saturn, although
	the molecule may actually be present in Saturn at this abundance.
	If condensation of HCN is included, the deep tropospheric HCN limits
	are increased to 2 ppb for Jupiter and similar to 15 ppb for Saturn.
	We set a tropospheric HCl upper limit of 5 ppb in Jupiter, and have
	tentatively detected this molecule at a mole fraction of 1.1 ppb
	in Saturn. We set HBr upper limits of 7 ppb in Jupiter and 1.1 ppb
	in Saturn. To our knowledge, these are the first spectroscopic limits
	on the halides in any jovian planet. They indicate that Cl is strongly
	depleted relative to the solar abundance in the upper tropospheres
	of Jupiter and Saturn, but the tentative detection of HCl in Saturn
	suggests that vertical transport is rapid compared to the chemical
	lifetime of HCl. We also obtain upper limits of 29 ppb (Jupiter)
	and 16 ppb (Saturn) for H2S (the latter is an order of magnitude
	improvement over existing measurements), and 22 ppb (Jupiter) and
	5 ppb (Saturn) for HCP. For Saturn, this is nearly a factor of 2
	smaller than the value suggested by photochemical models of Kaye
	and Strobel (1984). Finally, we obtain upper limits of 11 ppt (Jupiter)
	and 12 ppt (Saturn) for LIH, and 8 ppt (Jupiter) and 5 ppt (Saturn)
	for NaH. These are the first tropospheric upper limits to be placed
	on alkali metals in the troposphere of the Jovian planets, and indicate
	that both Li and Na are strongly depleted relative to meteoritic
	abundances. All limits are 3 sigma values. (C) 1996 Academic Press,

Abstract = {{Context. Despite their large number in the Galaxy, M dwarfs remain
   elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long remained
   a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation).
   Aims. Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres,
   update the M dwarf T-eff-spectral type relation, and find the
   atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample.
   Methods. We compare two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M
   dwarf sequence with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a
   chi(2) minimization technique to determine T-eff. The first sample
   consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology
   Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55
   medium-resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory
   (SSO). The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already
   classified M dwarfs.
   Results. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope
   of the spectral energy distribution and most of its features. Only the
   CaOH band at 5570 angstrom and AlH and NaH hydrides in the blue part of
   the spectra are still missing in the models. The T-eff scale obtained
   with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m spectra is consistent with that
   obtained with the NTT spectra. We compare our T-eff scale with those of
   other authors and with published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors.
   We also present relations between effective temperature, spectral type,
   and colors of the M dwarfs.}},

   abstract = {Accurate and complete rotational, rotational-vibrational and rotational-vibrational-electronic line lists are calculated for sodium hydride: both the NaH and NaD isotopologues are considered. These line lists cover all ro-vibrational states of the ground (X-1 Sigma(+)) and first excited (A (1) Sigma(+)) electronic states. The calculations use available spectroscopically- determined potential energy curves and new high-quality, ab initio dipole moment curves. Partition functions for both isotopologues are calculated and the effect of quasi-bound states is considered. The resulting line lists are suitable for temperatures up to about 7000 K and are designed for studies of exoplanet atmospheres, brown dwarfs and cool stars. In particular, the NaH A - X band is found to show a broad absorption feature at about 385 nm which should provide a signature for the molecule. All partition functions, lines and transitions are available as supplementary information to this article and at www.exomol.com.},
