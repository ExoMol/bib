abstract = {The gas-phase infrared spectrum of the A2Σ+ ← X2Π electronic transition
of the NaO radical was observed for the first time utilizing tunable diode laser
differential absorption spectroscopy; 109 lines were found within the region 2015−2095
cm-1 and 45 lines within 2654−2696 cm-1. The NaO radical was produced by reaction
of sodium vapor with N2O in a fast flow tube and detected using an astigmatic
Herriott multipass absorption cell combined with rapid sweep integration absorption
signal processing. Simple kinetic studies were performed in order to differentiate
the NaO radical features from precursor N2O lines. The NaO A2Σ+ ← X2Π vibronic
band structure was modeled using ab initio calculations by Langhoff and co-workers;
the simulated NaO band profile agrees reasonably well with that observed. A preliminary
assignment of some observed lines and the resulting molecular constants are presented.
Quantitative absorption strength measurements indicate that either absorption line
strengths for this transition are significantly smaller than indicated by ab initio
calculations or the Na + N2O reaction produces a significant fraction of NaO(A)
state which resists collisional quenching under our experimental conditions. },
