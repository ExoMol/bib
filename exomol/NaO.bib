Abstract = {A preliminary theoretical characterization of the reaction NaO + HCl in
   the gas phase and in the presence of a cluster of seventeen water
   molecules has been carried out. The purpose of this explorative study is
   to investigate the NaCl + OH reaction for the formation of interstellar
   NaCl, both in the gas phase and on the surface of amorphous ice of
   interstellar grains. The reaction was seen to occur without entrance
   barriers to form an adduct that easily evolves into the NaCl + OH
   products both in the gas phase and in the presence of the cluster of
   water molecules. In the case of the cluster reaction, we have simulated
   an Eley-Rideal mechanism in which HCl approaches, from the gas phase,
   the NaO radical bound to the 17-water-molecules cluster. Both the gas
   and ice reactions are strongly exothermic and feasible from a
   thermodynamic standpoint. Furthermore, being barrierless, they are also
   expected to be fast under the typical conditions of the interstellar
   medium. Therefore, this process can be added to the list of reactions to
   be considered as possible formation routes of the diatomic NaCl molecule
   in the interstellar medium. More work is needed to better describe this
   system and other similar reactions, such as those leading to KCl, which
   is also observed in the interstellar medium.},

Title = {{Photodissociation cross sections and rates of NaO}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {527},
Pages = {3847-3857},
Abstract = {Photodissociation of NaO may be important for the sodium chemistry in
   various astrophysical regions. This work produces the photodissociation
   cross sections and rates of NaO over the temperature range from 0 to
   15000 K. First, the state-resolved cross sections for transitions from
   the ground and first excited states of NaO are investigated using ab
   initio potential energy curves and transition dipole moments. The
   temperature-dependent cross sections were then obtained by assuming a
   Boltzmann distribution to describe the population of the initial state.
   Detailed comparisons with experimental cross sections at 200 and 300 K
   reveal that the X (2)Pi -> 1 (2)Delta and X (2)Pi -> 2 (2)Sigma(-)
   transitions may be the main photodissociation pathways for NaO in the
   wavelengths of about 2400-2580 angstrom, while the X (2)Pi -> B
   (2)Sigma(-) transition may play a dominant role in the wavelengths of
   about 3534-4230 angstrom. Finally, photodissociation rates in the
   interstellar, solar, and blackbody radiation fields were determined. In
   the interstellar and solar radiation fields, the X (2)Pi -> B
   (2)Sigma(-) transition dominates at low temperatures and the A
   (2)Sigma(+) -> 2 (2)Sigma(+) transition dominates at high temperatures.
   The total photodissociation rates in ultraviolet-rich and visible-rich
   radiation fields are almost insensitive to the temperature. The
   photodissociation cross sections and rates of NaO should be useful for
   investigating the chemical evolution of the sodium element in planetary
   exospheres, atmospheres of cool stars, and envelopes of evolved stars.},

    abstract = "{The sodium monoxide radical (NaO) is observed in night-glow in the Earth’s mesosphere and likely has astronomical importance. This study concerns the optical transitions within the ground X 2Π state and to the very low-lying (Te ≈ 2000 cm−1) excited A 2Σ+ state. A line list consisting of rovibronic term values, allowed electric dipole transitions, Einstein coefficients, and partition functions for varying temperature are produced using a variational solution of the coupled-channel Schrödinger equations using the program duo. multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) ab initio calculations characterizing the potential energy curves of the two states, spin-orbit and L-uncoupling non-adiabatic matrix elements, as well as permanent and transition dipole moments were integral in the formation of the final deperturbation model. Ab initio potential energy curves are represented in the analytical Extended Morse Oscillator form and refined, along with the spin-orbit and L-uncoupling functions, by least-squares fitting to the available spectroscopic data. The input experimental data consisted of pure rotational transitions within the fine-structure components of the X 2Π state for v″ ∈ [0, 3] vibrational levels as well as the rovibronic A 2Σ+(v′ = 0) ← X 2Π(v″ = 0) transitions, both with limited coverage over rotational excitation. The lack of data detailing the vibrational structure of the X and A states points to the need for further experimental study of higher excited levels, which would provide a more robust spectroscopic model. The NaO NaOUCMe line list is available via www.exomol.com and the CDS data base.}",

journal = JPCA,
year = {1999},
volume = {103},
pages = {3193-3199},
abstract = {The gas-phase infrared spectrum of the A2Σ+ ← X2Π electronic transition
of the NaO radical was observed for the first time utilizing tunable diode laser
differential absorption spectroscopy; 109 lines were found within the region 2015−2095
cm-1 and 45 lines within 2654−2696 cm-1. The NaO radical was produced by reaction
of sodium vapor with N2O in a fast flow tube and detected using an astigmatic
Herriott multipass absorption cell combined with rapid sweep integration absorption
signal processing. Simple kinetic studies were performed in order to differentiate
the NaO radical features from precursor N2O lines. The NaO A2Σ+ ← X2Π vibronic
band structure was modeled using ab initio calculations by Langhoff and co-workers;
the simulated NaO band profile agrees reasonably well with that observed. A preliminary
assignment of some observed lines and the resulting molecular constants are presented.
Quantitative absorption strength measurements indicate that either absorption line
strengths for this transition are significantly smaller than indicated by ab initio
calculations or the Na + N2O reaction produces a significant fraction of NaO(A)
state which resists collisional quenching under our experimental conditions. },
