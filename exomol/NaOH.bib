abstract = {This paper reports the rotational excitation of the alkali sodium
hydroxide molecule () by collision with helium atom. We present a new 2D potential
energy surface (PES) for NaOH–He van der Waals complex. The PES was computed at
the coupled cluster level of theory with single, double and perturbative triple
excitation (CCSD(T)) using the aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets for the four atoms with bound
functions. A global minimum of −100.15 cm−1 is found at linear geometry He–NaOH
and a local minimum of −21.94 cm−1 is located at linear geometry He–HONa. The
scattering calculations were performed, via close coupling approach, for a grid
of total energies up to 1500 cm−1 to ensure converged state-to-state rate coefficients
for kinetic temperatures ranging from 5 K up to 300 K among the first 13 rotational
levels. Propensity rules that favor Δj = ±1 transitions are found. These new rates
have great potential for NaOH detection in the interstellar medium.},

relativistic effective core potentials for the heavier atoms has been used to study
their equilibrium geometries, interaction energies, electron affinities, electric

a linear shape with the exception of BeOH, BeOH-, and MgOH-, for which the equilibrium
structure is found to be bent. Our analysis shows that the alkaline earth hydroxide
anions are valence-bound whereas the alkali hydroxide anions are dipole bound. In the
context of sympathetic cooling of OH- by collision with ultracold alkali and alkaline
earth atoms, we investigate the 2D MOH- potential energy surfaces and the associative
detachment reaction M + OH →- MOH + e-, which is the only energetically allowed reactive
channel in the cold regime. We discuss the implication for the sympathetic cooling
of OH- and conclude that Li and K are the best candidates for an ultracold buffer gas.},

gases (e.g., Si(OH)4, Mg(OH)2, Fe(OH)2, Ni(OH)2, Al(OH)3, Ca(OH)2, NaOH, KOH)

CaClOH, FAl(OH)2) in much larger amounts than expected from their vapor pressures
over volatile-free solid or molten rock at high temperatures expected for steam
atmospheres on the early Earth and hot rocky exoplanets. We quantitatively compute
the extent of fractional vaporization by defining gas/magma distribution coefficients
and show that Earth's subsolar Si/Mg ratio may be due to loss of a primordial steam
atmosphere. We conclude that hot rocky exoplanets that are undergoing or have undergone
escape of steam-bearing atmospheres may experience fractional vaporization and loss
of Si, Mg, Fe, Ni, Al, Ca, Na, and K. This loss can modify their bulk composition,

Pages = {5617-5630},
Abstract = {High-level ab initio calculations, including variants of the Wn and G3
   procedures, have been used to determine the structures and heats of
   formation of the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal oxides and
   hydroxides (M2O, MOH: M = Li, Na, and K; MO, M(OH)(2): M = Be, Mg, and
   Ca). Our best structures were obtained at the
   CCSD(T)(riv,rv)/aug'-cc-pWCVQZ level and are in uniformly close
   agreement with available experimental data, with a mean absolute
   deviation from experimental metal-oxygen bond lengths of just 0.007
   Angstrom. Structures obtained with CCSD(T)/cc-pWCVQZ, B3-LYP/cc-pVTZ,
   B3-LYP/6-31 G(2df,p), and MP2(full)/6-311+G(3df,2p) are also in good
   agreement with experiment. Zero-point vibrational energies and enthalpy
   temperature corrections are found to be relatively insensitive to the
   various procedures employed. However, the heats of formation for these
   molecules are challenging targets for high-level ab initio procedures.
   In the Wn-type procedures, it is found that expanding the correlation
   space on the metal atoms from the normal relaxed valence (rv) (or
   frozen-core) specification to relaxed inner valence (riv) requires the
   use of newly developed core-valence basis sets (cc-pWCVnZ) in the
   extrapolation calculations to obtain reliable results. Our best
   calculated heats of formation (DeltaH(f) (298)) come from a procedure
   designated W2C//ACQ, while oG3{[}CC](dir,full) is the best of the
   G3-type procedures. Recommended DeltaH(f) (298) values, weighted toward
