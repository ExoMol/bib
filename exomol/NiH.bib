Abstract = {{A detailed study of the three interacting low-lying electronic states
   (2)Delta, (2)Sigma(+) and (2)Pi of NiH -the so called
   ``supermultiplet{''} - is presented. A coupled-channels model reproduces
   the experimental term values of (NiH)-Ni-58, (NiH)-Ni-80 and (NiH)-Ni-62
   with accuracy very close to the estimated uncertainty of 0.01 cm(-1).
   The model is based on a set of Hund's case (a) potential curves and
   R-dependent coupling functions. In addition to the expected spin-orbit
   and various rotational couplings between the zero-order states,
   second-order effects are found to be important. The spin-orbit
   interaction is large compared to the separations between these
   electronic states, so that most of the observed rovibrational levels are
   strong mixtures of the Omega components of the multiplet. The fitting
   procedure proved difficult because there were no perturbation-free data
   to determine the starting values for the model functions. For the
   potential curves we were guided by previous effective Hamiltonian
   models; ab initio predictions supplied starting values for the
   spin-orbit and the rotational coupling functions. We believe that this
   model may be reliably extrapolated to higher rotational levels, with
   potential applications in the simulation of high temperature spectra,
   for example in the context of stellar atmospheres.}},

abstract = {ABSTRACTSignatures of metal hydride molecules appear in the optical
spectra of cool stars. The observed spectra are used not only for identification
of the molecule, but also to assess the abundance of the metal from which the
molecule is composed, and to measure the strength of the magnetic field in which
the molecule is immersed through the Zeeman splitting of individual spectral lines.
Metal hydrides are short-lived radicals, often produced via an electrical discharge,
and their steady-state concentrations in a sample are low. High-sensitivity probing
techniques, like laser-induced fluorescence, are often appropriate, but (typically
much less sensitive) absorption techniques are more useful to assess metal abundances.
We describe here a cavity ring-down spectroscopy experiment, usually used to detect
absorptions from stable molecules, to collect spectra with very high sensitivity
and reproducibility from prototypical metal hydrides NiH and NiD. We have constructed
an optical cavity of high finesse (F = 60,000) into which a sputtering source is
inserted, and have employed optical fibre and a rigid mounting scheme to keep the
ring-down mirrors in alignment during an experiment and between days. We compare
our NiH/NiD absorption data with literature results, and highlight some of the
strengths and weaknesses of this approach.},

	Slater exchange and LYP gradient-corrected correlation functional)
	with two basis sets: all-electron (AE) Wachters+f basis set and Stuttgart
	RSC effective core potential (ECP) and basis set. We find that, overall,
	the best agreement with experiment, comparable to that of the high-level
	CASPT2, is obtained with B3LYP/AE, closely followed by Becke98/AE
	and Becke98/ECP. FSLYP/AE and B3LYP/ECP give slightly worse agreement
	with experiment, and FSLYP/ECP is the only method among the ones
	we studied that gives an unacceptably large error, underestimating
	the dissociation energy of Ni-2 by 28\%, and being in the largest
	disagreement with the experiment and the other theoretical predictions.
	We also find that for Ni-2, the spin projection for the broken-symmetry
	unrestricted singlet states changes the ordering of the states, but
	the splittings are less than 10 meV. All our calculations predict
	a deltadelta-hole ground state for Ni-2 and delta-hole ground state
	for NiH. Upon spin projection of the singlet state of Ni-2, almost
	all of our calculations: Becke98 and FSLYP both AE and ECP and B3LYP/AE
	predict (1)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y 2)(B)) or (1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B))
	ground state, which is a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and (1)Gamma(g).
	B3LYP/ECP predicts a (3)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(xy)(B)) (mixture of (3)Sigma(g)(-)
	and (3)Gamma(u)) ground state virtually degenerate with the (1)(d(x
	2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y 2)(B))/(1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B)) state. The doublet
	delta-hole ground state of NiH predicted by all our calculations
	is in agreement with the experimentally predicted (2)Delta ground
	state. For Ni-2, all our results are consistent with the experimentally
	predicted ground state of 0(g)(+) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and
	(3)Sigma(g)(-)) or 0(u)(-) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(u)(-) and (3)Sigma(u)(+)).},
