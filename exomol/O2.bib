Title = {Survey of the updated Oxygen line list in the {ITRAN2024} spectroscopic
   database},
Journal =JQSRT,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {347},
Abstract = {Light-matter interactions involving molecular oxygen (O2) span numerous
   decades in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and are important
   to many thermophysical and thermochemical mechanisms, ranging from
   atmospheric remote sensing of greenhouse gases, aerosols, pollutants,
   temperature and pressure, visible and infrared radiative exchange in the
   upper atmosphere, ozone formation and decomposition, and the search for
   life beyond Earth, among many other examples. Here, we highlight
   advances in the quantitative spectroscopy of O2, for which updated
   band-specific, line-by-line parameters have been provided in the
   HITRAN2024 spectroscopic database. Theoretical results are presented for
   electric quadrupole transition intensities in the ground state of 16O2,
   and the Noxon band in the near-infrared region has been included in
   HITRAN for the first time. Particular focus is placed on the 1.27 mu m,
   A-and B-bands of O2, in which intensities, line-shape (including
   beyond-Voigt parameterizations), and position parameters with improved
   accuracy and/or extended spectral coverage are presented. Corrections to
   the Schumann-Runge bands are also reported. The paper closes with
   recommendations and an outlook on key challenges in advancing our
   understanding of the spectroscopy of O2.},

abstract = {In this study, we update and integrate a line-by-line (LBL) module for calculating the O2 cross section (σO2) within the Schumann-Runge Bands (SRB, 175.4-206.2 nm) into the Tropospheric Ultraviolet Visible (TUV) model V5.4. This coupling allows us to analyze the impact of precise σO2 calculations on the photolysis rate coefficient of O2 (JO2) and over 20 other molecules (J-values) at different altitudes. To compute σO2 within the SRB, the LBL module uses the HIgh-resolution TRANsmission molecular absorption (HITRAN) 2020 database and the local O2 absorption, while the standard TUV model uses the Koppers and Murtagh (K&M) parameterization, which considers the overhead O2 slant path. In addition to correcting previously unnoticed errors in HITRAN and K&M datasets, the updated model now allows a separate handling of the underlying Herzberg (HZC) and Schumann-Runge (SRC) continuum in the wavelength region where they overlap with SRB (175.4-180 and 190-206.2 nm). Through TUV calculations, we found that JO2 differences between the standard K&M and LBL versions are up to 6% in the upper mesosphere and –2 % in the middle-upper stratosphere. These variations affect the tropospheric and/or stratospheric J-values of several long-lived and short-lived halogenated species differently, depending on their individual cross sections and the extent of overlap with SRB. Despite variability, persistent altitude-dependent patterns are identified and explained by radiation contributions within the underlying SRC and HZC ranges. In particular, the LBL J-values of HCFC-22, CFC-115 and CHCl3 are 12%, 8% and 2% lower in the middle-upper stratosphere, respectively, and up to 24% larger in the lower stratosphere, which is of relevance for the evolution of the ozone layer.}

Title = {{Night O2 (a10g) airglow spatial distribution and temporal behavior on
   Venus based on SPICAV IR/VEx nadir dataset}},
Journal = {ICARUS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {429},
Abstract = {The infrared O2 (a10g) airglow driven by the subsolar to antisolar
   circulation occurs between two global circulation regimes on Venus: the
   zonal super-rotation below 90 km and the subsolar to antisolar
   circulation over 120 km. Here we report the complete global results of
   SPICAV IR/Venus Express observations of O2 (a10g) nightglow from 2006
   till the end of the mission in 2014. The spectrometer resolving power of
   1000 at the considered spectral range was the highest among Venus
   Express instruments, and it was sufficient to resolve O2 (a10g) airglow
   and thermal emission signals. The nadir spectra were fitted to a model
   representing these two phenomena ensuring robust separation of the
   thermal emission, and so retrieval of the airglow intensity. Its spatial
   distribution in the night hemisphere, averaged among 8 years of
   observations, shows the maximum intensity of 1.4 +/- 0.8 MR located at
   23H30 of local time and 0-5 degrees N of latitude. A high variability of
   the airglow was observed. ``Bright spots{''}, i.e., those with an
   intensity above the global maximum, were observed over a latitude range
   of 70 degrees S-70 degrees N with the majority occurring around the
   antisolar point. Lack of imaging capability was an obstacle to track the
   short-term variations by SPICAV IR. A single observation sequence of 20
   days covering neighboring locations exhibits indications of airglow
   intensity fluctuations with a 5.4-day periodicity. SPICAV IR working
   period covered the end of the 23rd Solar cycle and the solar activity
   increase of the 24th Solar cycle. A correlation of the O2 (a10g) with
   the EUV solar flux increase predicted by global circulation model
   simulations was not found.},

Title = {Impact of oxygen fugacity on the atmospheric structure and emission
   spectra of ultra-hot rocky exoplanets},
Journal =AA,
Year = {2024},
Volume = {691},
Abstract = {Context. Atmospheres above lava-ocean planets (LOPs) hold clues related
   to the properties of their interiors, based on the expectation that the
   two reservoirs are in chemical equilibrium. Furthermore, such
   atmospheres are observable with current-generation space- and
   ground-based telescopes. While efforts have been made to understand how
   emission spectra are related to the composition of the lava ocean, the
   influence of oxygen fugacity has yet to be examined in a self-consistent
   way.
   Aims. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of atmospheric emission
   spectra of LOPs to key geochemical parameters, namely, temperature (T),
   composition (X), and oxygen fugacity (fO(2)). We also consider the
   precision involved in recovering these spectra from observations of hot,
   rocky exoplanets.
   Methods. We considered `mineral' atmospheres produced in equilibrium
   with silicate liquids. We treated fO(2) as an independent variable,
   together with T and X, to compute equilibrium partial pressures (p) of
   stable gas species at the liquid-gas interface. Above this boundary, the
   atmospheric speciation and the pressure-temperature structure are
   computed self-consistently to yield emission spectra. We explored a wide
   array of plausible compositions, oxygen fugacities (between 6 log(10)
   units below and above the iron-wustite buffer, IW), and irradiation
   temperatures (2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K) relevant to LOPs.
   Results. We find that SiO(g), Fe(g) and Mg(g) are the major species
   below similar to IW, ceding to O-2(g) and O(g) in more oxidised
   atmospheres. The transition between the two regimes demarcates a minimum
   in total pressure (P). Because p scales linearly with X, emission
   spectra are only modest functions of composition. By contrast, fO(2) can
   vary over orders of magnitude, thereby causing commensurate changes in
   p. Atmospheres outgassed from reducing melts exhibit intense SiO
   emission, creating a temperature inversion in the upper atmosphere.
   Conversely, oxidised atmospheres have lower pSiO and lack thermal
   inversions, with their resulting emission spectra mimicking that of a
   black-body. Consequently, the intensity of SiO emission relative to the
   background, generated by MgO(g), can be used to quantify the fO(2) of
   the atmosphere. Depending on the emission spectroscopy metric of the
   target, deriving the fO(2) of known nearby LOPs is possible with a few
   secondary occultations observed by JWST.},
