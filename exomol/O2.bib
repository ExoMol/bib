Title = {{High sensitivity spectroscopy of the O-2 band at 1.27 mu m: (I) pure O-2

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{241}},
Abstract = {{The atmospheric band of O-2 near 1.27 mu m plays an important role in
   determining the sounded air-mass from ground or space borne atmospheric
   spectra. This band consists of narrow absorption lines of the a(-1)
   Delta(g) - X-3 Sigma(-)(g) (0 - 0) transitions superimposed to a much
   broader collision-induced absorption structure. The present contribution
   is part of a long standing project aiming to improve different aspects
   of the spectroscopy of this band by highly sensitive cavity ring down
   spectroscopy (CRDS).
   In the present contribution, low pressure (5 and 10Torr) spectra of pure
   O-2 were recorded with unprecedented sensitivity in the 7920-8085 cm(-1)
   interval (noise equivalent absorption, alpha(min), on the order of
   10(-12) cm(-1)) using an external cavity diode laser. About 170 lines
   including electric quadrupole transitions were accurately measured. The
   weakest lines have intensity on the order of 10(-30) cm/molecule. The
   coupling of the CRDS spectrometer with a self-referenced frequency comb
   allows for an important gain on the accuracy of the line center
   determination. Detailed line profile analysis using the quadratic
   speed-dependent Nelkin-Ghatak profile was performed for a series of
   twelve lines recorded for pressures up to 150 Torr. In particular, the
   very weak self-pressure shifts (on the order of 10(-3) cm(-1)/atm) could
   be determined for the first time. Line intensities with uncertainty of
   1\% are reported for lines with intensity larger than 10 -28
   cm/molecule. Accurate spectroscopic parameters of the a(1)Delta(g)(v= 0)
   upper level were fitted to the zero-pressure line centers. An rms value
   of 108 kHz (3.6 x 10(-6 )cm(-1)) is achieved for the (meas.-talc.)
   differences of the (16)O(2 )a(1)Delta(g) (v=0) upper level (J(max)= 37).
   Significant deviations compared to the HITRAN database are discussed.}},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{240}},
Abstract = {{A cavity ring down spectrometer referenced to a frequency comb is used
   to study the profile of air-broadened O-2 lines of the 1.27 mu m band.
   To this aim, spectra of O-2 in dry air and in N-2 with 2\% relative
   abundance of O-2 were measured, in the 7720-7920 cm(-)(1) and 7868-7887
   cm(-1) spectral ranges, respectively. Spectra were recorded at room
   temperature and various pressures ranging from 50 to 700 Torr. Detailed
   line-profile analysis is reported for 85 transitions using the
   speed-dependent Nelkin-Ghatak model and a multi-spectrum treatment of
   the two series of spectra. Line mixing was found necessary to be taken
   into account in the analysis of lines in the region of the Q branch. The
   derived line parameters including the broadening and shifting
   coefficients, the speed-dependence components of the collisional line
   broadening and shifting, as well as the Dicke narrowing parameter are
   discussed and compared to literature data. In particular, the
   speed-dependence components of the collisional broadening are found to
   agree satisfactorily with predictions obtained by molecular dynamic
   simulations. This obtained set of line-shape parameters should allow for
   improved modeling of atmospheric spectra in the 1.27 mu m spectral
   region. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

abstract = {Retrievals of atmospheric composition from near-infrared measurements
require measurements of airmass to better than the desired precision of the composition.
The oxygen bands are obvious choices to quantify airmass since the mixing ratio
of oxygen is fixed over the full range of atmospheric conditions. The OCO-2 mission
is currently retrieving carbon dioxide concentration using the oxygen A-band for
airmass normalization. The 0.25% accuracy desired for the carbon dioxide concentration
has pushed the required state-of-the-art for oxygen spectroscopy. To measure O2
A-band cross-sections with such accuracy through the full range of atmospheric
pressure requires a sophisticated line-shape model (Rautian or Speed-Dependent
Voigt) with line mixing (LM) and collision induced absorption (CIA). Models of
each of these phenomena exist, however, this work presents an integrated self-consistent
model developed to ensure the best accuracy. It is also important to consider
multiple sources of spectroscopic data for such a study in order to improve the
dynamic range of the model and to minimize effects of instrumentation and associated
systematic errors. The techniques of Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS) and
Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) allow complimentary information for such an
analysis. We utilize multispectrum fitting software to generate a comprehensive
new database with improved accuracy based on these datasets. The extensive information
will be made available as a multi-dimensional cross-section (ABSCO) table and the
parameterization will be offered for inclusion in the HITRANonline database.},

molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN
edition of 2012 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular
absorption compilation is composed of five major components: the traditional
line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer
codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to
representation in a line-by-line form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol
indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally
to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral
coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity.
Moreover, molecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address
the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR
cross-sections for almost 300 additional molecules important in different areas
of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The compilation can be
accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into
an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the
long-standing sequential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user
in many ways. It enables the incorporation of an extended set of fundamental
parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape formalisms, easy user-defined
output formats, and very convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data.
A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language
(SQL) features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided.},

(v=0)) bands of oxygen in the visible region had not been used extensively in
satellite remote sensing of the atmosphere. These bands roughly cover the regions
around 14,527 and 15,904 cm−1, respectively (0.69 and 0.63 μm). However, these
bands (in particular the B-band) are now being increasingly considered for future
satellite missions. In this light, it is important to make sure that the reference
spectroscopic parameters allow accurate retrieval of important physical characteristics
from the atmospheric spectra. The spectroscopic parameters currently given for these
bands in the HITRAN2008 spectroscopic database were tested against high-resolution
atmospheric spectra measured with solar-pointing Fourier transform spectrometers
at Park Falls, Wisconsin (B-band) and Kitt Peak, Arizona (γ-band). It was found
that the current HITRAN parameters cannot produce satisfactory fits of the observed
spectra. In order to improve the database we have collected the best available
measured line positions that involve the b1Σg+ (v=1 and v=2) states for the three
most abundant isotopologues of oxygen and performed a combined fit to obtain a
consistent set of spectroscopic constants. These constants were then used to calculate
the line positions. A careful review of the available intensity and line-shape
measurements was also carried out, and new parameters were derived based on that
review. In particular, line shift parameters, that were not previously available,
were introduced. The new data have been validated using the high-resolution atmospheric
spectra measured with the Fourier transform spectrometers at Park Falls, Wisconsin
(B-band) and Kitt Peak, Arizona (γ-band) and have yielded substantial improvement.
In addition, we report the first direct observation and analysis of the 16O18O
lines in the γ-band.},

in the literature—thus contributing to the efforts to measure the oxygen A-band
intensities with an accuracy better than 1%. We determined the integrated band
strength and Einstein A coefficient. Using our spectrum calibration method we
could clearly show for the first time that there is a meaningful statistical
discrepancy in the frequency standards used in spectroscopic studies for the
oxygen A-band. We were able to explain how this discrepancy leads to two different
sets of shifts reported in the literature and demonstrate the need for precise
frequency-type transition wavenumber measurements of the oxygen A-band transitions.
We observed deviations from the conventional Voigt profile due to speed-dependent
broadening and line mixing effects. Dicke narrowing was observed on a selected
group of spectra recorded at pressures between 98 and 337 Torr. The Dicke narrowed
lineshapes were best modeled using a Galatry profile implemented using a fixed
value for the velocity-changing collision rate. The weak line mixing coefficients
were determined from fits using the speed-dependent models. Exponential Power Gap
(EPG) and Energy Corrected Sudden (ECS) scaling laws were used to calculate the

to fit the observed lineshapes well. Line intensities obtained using the Galatry
profile are compared with previously measured values and found to be approximately
1% smaller than intensities found in current databases. Many of the other lineshape
parameters are in good agreement with previous measurements. However, the
pressure-induced shifts of the current work are considered much more accurate
than other studies. Finally we report on the line parameters of each of the

abstract = {The oxygen fine structure line 1− at 118.75 GHz was studied by two
spectrometers at low (0.2–3.5 Torr) and high (atmosphere) pressures in air and
pure oxygen. Improvement in the spectrometer with BWO and acoustic detector included
use of a powerful (more than 40 mW) radiation source. Improvement in the modern
resonator spectrometer included exclusion of apparatus function by sample substitution
and a wider (110–130 GHz) scanned frequency range. As a result, the 1− oxygen
line was observed by both spectrometers with high (up to 450) signal-to-noise
ratio which permitted precise measurements of the line parameters. The investigation
separated linear- and quadratic-with-pressure displacement of the line center.
The line mixing coefficient responsible for apparent quadratic dependence of the
center frequency on pressure was measured experimentally for the first time for
this line. The line mixing coefficient was measured at 297 K as −4.62(38)×10−5
Torr−1 for pure oxygen and −5.9(29)×10−5 Torr−1 for air, compared to the previously
calculated value −3.1×10−5 Torr−1. Linear dependence of the line center frequency
on pressure does not exceed ±20 kHz/Torr for air and ±10 kHz/Torr for pure oxygen.
Refined values of line broadening were obtained. Integral intensity of the line
was measured. A comparison with the previous investigations is presented. Inconsistencies
in published data about pressure line shifts of oxygen molecule spectral lines
are discussed.},

earlier publications, with the exception that there is significant population in
the previously undiscerned v=0 level. The vibrational distributions of the A'3Δu
and A3Σu+ states are essentially the same when comparison is made in terms of the
level energies. The intensity of Chamberlain band emission at the peak of the
distribution is about one-fourth that of the Herzberg I emission, as previously
shown, and may be related primarily to radiative efficiency. The peaks in both
population distributions are about 0.25eV below the O(3P)+O(3P) dissociation limit.
We compare these Herzberg state distributions with that of the O2(b1Σg+) state,
concurring with others that the intense nightglow emission associated with b1Σg+(v=0)
is a reflection of direct transfer from the Herzberg states. This process takes
place following O2 collisions, with simultaneous production of very high a1Δg and
b1Σg+ vibrational levels.},

an analysis requires the use of an iteration to find the minimum for the so-called
merit function. A method has been developed to secure a stable iteration. The energy
expression originally contains 21 constants. A systematic search leads to a reduction
of this to 19 constants to make the fit possible. This results in two solutions,
which are, however, only two different ways of indicating the one final energy
function. The systematic use of iterations reduces the influence of the computational
uncertainty on the final molecular constants to be orders of magnitude lower than
the uncertainty due to the experimental errors.},

spectroscopy of molecular oxygen at wavelengths near 763 nm. An equivalent absorption
length of ∼1 km was obtained by a 26-cm-long optical cavity with a finesse of 6000.
An extended cavity diode laser was frequency locked to the cavity, and pure absorption
profiles were recovered by monitoring of the cavity transmission during continuous
scans of the cavity resonance through O2 rotational lines, allowing a detailed
investigation of the line shapes. Phase modulation of the laser at a frequency
equal to the cavity free-spectral-range frequency was employed for detection of
weak absorption signals inside the cavity. A minimum detectable absorption coefficient
of 6.9×10-11 cm-1 Hz-1/2 was measured. Finally, a test of the symmetrization postulate
in  16O nuclei was demonstrated.},

of the order of magnitude of 0.009 cm-1 atm-1, had to be included in the fitting
procedure in order to fit the observed line profiles. Combining the data from
all spectra, line intensities with an accuracy of approximately 0.3% and self-broadening
coefficients with errors of 2–3% were derived for both temperatures, allowing
the determination of their temperature dependence. The line-by-line intensity

line strengths in a 3Δ(a)–3Σ(int) transition in terms of these parameters and are
applied to recent data of Coquart and Ramsay for the Herzberg III system of molecular

of lines of the Ω′ = 3 subbands of the 4–0 to 7–0 bands of the Herzberg III system,
which are forbidden for the spin–orbit mechanism. The wave numbers of these lines

the form of the free energy as a function of density and temperature. This fundamental
equation contains, in addition to pure polynomial and “BWR”-terms, new exponential
functions especially convenient for the critical region. To guarantee an effective
structure, the combination of the terms of the equation was found by using an
optimization method recently developed. As a result, the optimized function for
the free energy is capable of representing the thermodynamic surface of oxygen
in the range 54 ≤ T ≤ 300 K, 0 < p ≤ 818 bar and 0 < ρ ≤ 41 mol dm−3 within the
experimental uncertainty of the data available. With the exception of very few

of Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure, much progress has been made in the
field. While there have been some important refinements in the theory of diatomic

individual spectra. Not only has the number of molecules about which some spectroscopic
data are available been increased by a factor of 2 to 3, but also the spectroscopic
information about the molecules known in 1950 has been vastly extended. This is
due to the observation of new elec­ tronic states (about three times as many as
known before), the enormous improvements in the accuracy of the constants of the
states known in 1950, and the determination of higher order constants. In view
of the increasing use of spectroscopic information on diatomic molecules in other
fields of physics, in chemistry, and in astrophysics, it appeared desirable to
prepare an up-to-date version of the table of molecular constants in the appendix
of Vol. I. This updating proved to be far more time-consuming than originally
anticipated, and it is only now, 10 years that we are able to present such a table,
which, instead after its initiation, of the original 80 pages (plus 30 pages of
bibliography), now fills a volume of 700 pages. In the interest of economy, and
unlike the original version, the new table has been produced by photo-offset from
the final manuscript.},

state to the available experimental data including P-ρ-T data, saturation data,
and measured isochoric heat capacities. New vapor pressure equations and equations
for the ideal gas heat capacities for both oxygen and nitrogen have been developed
for use in the calculation of derived thermodynamic properties. By the use of a
new fitting technique, continuous integration along isotherms through the two-phase
region facilitates the calculation of liquid properties. A further advantage of
this formulation is the ease of programming a single equation of state for computer
calculations in design work. Details of the work outlined here may be found elsewhere E[1].},

These observations have recently been confirmed in rocket studies [Hennes, 1966].
However, firm interpretations of airglow intensity data for this system in terms
of photochemical processes taking place in the upper regions of the atmosphere
have been impeded by a lack of appropriate molecular band strengths. The quantities
controlling the integrated molecular band intensities in emission are defined by
equation image where H is a constant determined by units and geometry, Nv′ is the
population of the upper state, vv′′ is the band frequency, and Sv′v′′ is the band
strength of the transition. The band strengths are further defined in terms of
molecular parameters by the equation image in which the electronic transition moment
Rer¯), the Franck‐Condon factors qv′v′′, and the r‐centroids rv′v′′ are functions
of internuclear separation r. The Franck‐Condon factors often exert the dominating
influence on band intensities, and variations in the transition moment are relatively
unimportant. However, the behavior of Re(r) is in some doubt in the case of the
Herzberg I transition, and it has been suggested by Broida and Gaydon [1954] and
Nicholls [1955] that considerable variations might be expected. This research was,
therefore, directed to determine explicitly the dependence of the transition moment
on internuclear distance and to obtain thereby an array of smoothed band strengths.},

analysis has been carried out for all bands with ν′ > 11. In addition to the six
main branches (with ΔJ = ΔN = ± 1), for low values of the quantum number N (total
angular momentum apart from spin), several lines of the six satellite branches as
well as of the two "forbidden" branches (with ΔN = ± 3, ΔJ = ± 1) have been identified.
Values of the rotational constants and the vibrational quanta in the upper state

The origin of the 21–0 band is at 57115 cm−1. A very short extrapolation gives
the convergence limit at 57128 ± 5 cm−1. This limit agrees excellently with the
one derived from the near ultraviolet bands if it is assumed that at both limits
those O atoms that are produced in the 3P state are in the lowest component level
of this state, viz. 3P2. A discrepancy pointed out earlier by Herzberg is thus
removed. The convergence limit just mentioned and certain other data derived from
the spectrum lead to very precise information about the dissociation energy of O2.

sign. The splitting constants λ and γ have been determined and their variation
with the vibrational quantum number observed. In addition to the Q-form branches
weak O- and S-form branches have been found in agreement with the prediction of
Present which is based on the assumption that spin–orbit coupling is the main cause
for the occurrence of this forbidden transition. However, the relative intensities
of the different branches deviate strongly from Present's prediction. The dissociation

within the limits of accuracy of the observations by the following equation:

investigations, the details of their structure have remained only partially explained.
The earlier investigators [2] did not have any theory to guide them and it can
readily be understood that they often came to contradictory results. In the present
paper we have tried to account for the structure of the bands as completely as
possible. Our progress has been based on new wave-length measurements which we
believe to be more accurate than the previous ones.},
