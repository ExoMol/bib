Pages = {118-138},
Abstract = {{Retrievals of atmospheric composition from near-infrared measurements
   require measurements of airmass to better than the desired precision of
   the composition. The oxygen bands are obvious choices to quantify
   airmass since the mixing ratio of oxygen is fixed over the full range of
   atmospheric conditions. The OCO-2 mission is currently retrieving carbon
   dioxide concentration using the oxygen A-band for airmass normalization.
   The 0.25\% accuracy desired for the carbon dioxide concentration has
   pushed the required state-of-the-art for oxygen spectroscopy. To measure
   02 A-band cross-sections with such accuracy through the full range of
   atmospheric pressure requires a sophisticated line shape model (Rautian
   or Speed-Dependent Voigt) with line mixing (LM) and collision induced
   absorption (CIA). Models of each of these phenomena exist, however, this
   work presents an integrated self-consistent model developed to ensure
   the best accuracy.
   It is also important to consider multiple sources of spectroscopic data
   for such a study in order to improve the dynamic range of the model and
   to minimize effects of instrumentation and associated systematic errors.
   The techniques of Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS) and Cavity
   Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) allow complimentary information for such
   an analysis. We utilize multispectrum fitting software to generate a
   comprehensive new database with improved accuracy based on these
   datasets. The extensive information will be made available as a
   multi-dimensional cross-section (ABSCO) table and the parameterization
   will be offered for inclusion in the HITRANonline database.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a comprehensive review on molecular oxygen spectroscopy, we
   have measured rotational spectra of isotopic forms of molecular oxygen

   positions. Due to the high resolution and good signal-to-noise ratio,
   the fundamental hyperfine parameters eQq and CI are determinable for
   O-17-substituted species for the first time. A refined nuclear spin
   orbit coupling constant, a = -211.9328(283) MHz, was determined, and is
   roughly two orders of magnitude more precise than values determined from
   near infrared spectroscopy or electron spin resonance studies.
   Vibrationally excited oxygen in the a(1)Delta(g) electronic state was
   also observable with small signal levels for many of the rotational

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {2310-2322},
Abstract = {{Until recently the B (b(1)Sigma(+)(g) (nu=1)-X(3)Sigma(-)(g) (nu=0)) and
   gamma (b(1)Sigma(+)(g) (nu=2)-X(3)Sigma(-)(g) (nu=0)) bands of oxygen in
   the visible region had not been used extensively in satellite remote
   sensing of the atmosphere. These bands roughly cover the regions around
   14,527 and 15,904 cm(-1), respectively (0.69 and 0.63 mu m). However,
   these bands (in particular the B-band) are now being increasingly
   considered for future satellite missions. In this light, it is important
   to make sure that the reference spectroscopic parameters allow accurate
   retrieval of important physical characteristics from the atmospheric
   spectra. The spectroscopic parameters currently given for these bands in
   the HITRAN2008 spectroscopic database were tested against
   high-resolution atmospheric spectra measured with solar-pointing Fourier
   transform spectrometers at Park Falls, Wisconsin (B-band) and Kitt Peak,
   Arizona (gamma-band). It was found that the current HITRAN parameters
   cannot produce satisfactory fits of the observed spectra. In order to
   improve the database we have collected the best available measured line
   positions that involve the b(1)E(g)(+) (nu=1 and nu=2) states for the
   three most abundant isotopologues of oxygen and performed a combined fit
   to obtain a consistent set of spectroscopic constants. These constants
   were then used to calculate the line positions. A careful review of the
   available intensity and line-shape measurements was also carried out,
   and new parameters were derived based on that review. In particular,
   line shift parameters, that were not previously available, were
   introduced. The new data have been validated using the high-resolution
   atmospheric spectra measured with the Fourier transform spectrometers at
   Park Falls, Wisconsin (B-band) and Kitt Peak, Arizona (gamma-band) and
   have yielded substantial improvement. In addition, we report the first
   direct observation and analysis of the (16)O(18)O lines in the
   gamma-band.}},
