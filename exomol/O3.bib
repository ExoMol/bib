Abstract = {Reliable ozone spectral data consistent over several spectral ranges are
   a challenge for both experiment and theory. We present ab initio
   calculations for strong lines that lead to consistent results from the
   microwave to mid-infrared regions. The results agree well with
   established microwave line lists and our new measurements in the
   fundamental and first overtone regions of ozone at 5 and 10 m. The
   calculations and their agreement to within 1\% with measurements provide
   an important step toward consistent and accurate spectroscopic ozone
   data. The results imply that actual databases need to be corrected by
   about 3\% in the corresponding mid-infrared spectral intervals.
   Appropriate recommendations for the consistency of strong line
   intensities of the ozone molecule in microwave, 10 and 5 m ranges, in
   HITRAN (HIgh-resolution TRANsmittance and molecular apbsorption) and
   GEISA (Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques
   Atmospheriques) databases are suggested.},

intensity predictions for rotationally resolved spectra in a large range of overtone and combination bands}},
journal = JCP,

pages = {064304},
abstract = {Ab initio dipole moment surfaces (DMSs) of the ozone molecule are
computed using the MRCI-SD method with AVQZ, AV5Z, and VQZ-F12 basis sets on a
dense grid of about 1950 geometrical configurations. The analytical DMS representation
used for the fit of ab initio points provides better behavior for large nuclear
displacements than that of previous studies. Various DMS models were derived and
tested. Vibration-rotation line intensities of 16O3 were calculated from these
ab initio surfaces by the variational method using two different potential functions
determined in our previous works. For the first time, a very good agreement of
first principle calculations with the experiment was obtained for the line-by-line
intensities in rotationally resolved ozone spectra in a large far- and mid-infrared
range. This includes high overtone and combination bands up to ΔV = 6. A particular
challenge was a correct description of the B-type bands (even ΔV3 values) that
represented major difficulties for the previous ab initio investigations and for
the empirical spectroscopic models. The major patterns of various B-type bands
were correctly described without empirically adjusted dipole moment parameters.
For the 10 μm range, which is of key importance for the atmospheric ozone retrievals,
our ab initio intensity results are within the experimental error margins. The
theoretical values for the strongest lines of the ν3 band lie in general between
two successive versions of HITRAN (HIgh-resolution molecular TRANsmission) empirical
database that corresponded to most extended available sets of observations. The
overall qualitative agreement in a large wavenumber range for rotationally resolved
cold and hot ozone bands up to about 6000 cm−1 is achieved here for the first time.
These calculations reveal that several weak bands are yet missing from available
spectroscopic databases.},

Abstract = {A new accurate global potential energy surface for the ground electronic
   state of ozone {[}R. Dawes et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 201103 (2013)]
   was published fairly recently. The topography near dissociation differs
   significantly from previous surfaces, without spurious submerged reefs
   and corresponding van der Waals wells. This has enabled significantly
   improved descriptions of scattering processes, capturing the negative
   temperature dependence and large kinetic isotope effects in exchange
   reaction rates. The exchange reactivity was found to depend on the
   character of near-threshold resonances and their overlap with reactant
   and product wavefunctions, which in turn are sensitive to the potential.
   Here we present global ``three-well{''} calculations of all bound
   vibrational states of three isotopic combinations of ozone (O-48(3),
   (O2O)-O-16-O-18, (O2O)-O-16-O-17) for J = 0 and J = 1 with a focus on
   the character and density of highly excited states and discuss their
   impact on the ozone isotopic anomaly. The calculations were done using a
   parallel symmetry-adapted Lanczos method with the RV3 code. Some
   comparisons were made with results obtained with the improved relaxation
   method implemented in the Heidelberg multi-configuration time-dependent
   Hartree code.},

spectra from the ground: A spectroscopic database and wavelength region comparison}},
journal = JMS,
year = {2016},
volume = {326},
pages = {48-59},
abstract = {Atmospheric ozone concentration measurements mostly depend on
spectroscopic methods that cover different spectral regions. Despite long years
of measurement efforts, the uncertainty goal of 1% in absolute line intensities
has not yet been reached. Multispectral inter-comparisons using both laboratory
and atmospheric studies reveal that important discrepancies exist when ozone columns
are retrieved from different spectral regions. Here, we use ground based FTIR
to study the sensitivity of ozone columns on different spectroscopic parameters
as a function of individual bands for identifying necessary improvements of the
spectroscopic databases. In particular, we examine the degree of consistency that
can be reached in ozone retrievals using spectral windows in the 5 and 10 μm bands
of ozone. Based on the atmospheric spectra, a detailed database inter-comparison
between HITRAN (version 2012), GEISA (version 2011) and S&MPO (as retrieved from
the website at the end of 2015) is made. Data from the 10 μm window are consistent
to better than 1%, but there are larger differences when the windows at 5 μm are
included. The 5 μm results agree with the results from 10 μm within ±2% for all
databases. Recent S&MPO data are even more consistent with the desired level of 1%,
but spectroscopic data from HITRAN give about 4% higher ozone columns than those
from GEISA. If four sub-windows in the 5 μm band are checked for consistency,
retrievals using GEISA or S&MPO parameters show less dispersion than those using
HITRAN, where one window in the P-branch of the ν1 + ν3 band gives about 2% lower
results than the other three. The atmospheric observations are corroborated by a
direct comparison of the spectroscopic databases, using a simple statistical
analysis based on intensity weighted spectroscopic parameters. The bias introduced
by the weighted average approach is investigated and it is negligible if relative
differences between databases do not correlate with line intensities. This is the
case for the comparison of HITRAN with GEISA in the 10 μm region and the agreement
between the simple analysis and the full retrieval is better than 0.1%. At 5 μm
biases might be as high as 1.4%, and the proposed method is thus limited to the
same level of accuracy. Implications of the new data for database improvements and
further studies, in particular in the 5 μm region, are discussed.},

Title = {{Absorption cross-sections of ozone in the ultraviolet and visible
   spectral regions: Status report 2015}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {327},
Pages = {105-121},
Abstract = {The activity ``Absorption Cross-Sections of Ozone{''} (ACSO) started in
   2008 as a joint initiative of the International Ozone Commission (IO3C),
   the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the IGACO
   ({''}Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations{''}) O-3/UV
   subgroup to study, evaluate, and recommend the most suitable ozone
   absorption cross-section laboratory data to be used in atmospheric ozone
   measurements. The evaluation was basically restricted to ozone
   absorption cross-sections in the UV range with particular focus on the
   Huggins band. Up until now, the data of Bass and Paur published in 1985
   (BP, 1985) are still officially recommended for such measurements.
   During the last decade it became obvious that BP (1985) cross-section
   data have deficits for use in advanced space-borne ozone measurements.
   At the same time, it was recognized that the origin of systematic
   differences in ground-based measurements of ozone required further
   investigation, in particular whether the BP (1985) cross-section data
   might contribute to these differences.
   In ACSO, different sets of laboratory ozone absorption cross-section
   data (including their dependence on temperature) of the group of Reims
   (France) (Brion et al., 1993, 1998, 1992, 1995, abbreviated as BDM,
   1995) and those of Serdyuchenko et al. (2014), and Gorshelev et al.
   (2014), (abbreviated as SER, 2014) were examined for use in atmospheric
   ozone measurements in the Huggins band.
   In conclusion, ACSO recommends:
   The spectroscopic data of BP (1985) should no longer be used for
   retrieval of atmospheric ozone measurements
   For retrieval of ground-based instruments of total ozone and ozone
   profile measurements by the Umkehr method performed by Brewer and Dobson
   instruments data of SER (2014) are recommended to be used. When SER
   (2014) is used, the difference between total ozone measurements of
   Brewer and Dobson instruments are very small and the difference between
   Dobson measurements at AD and CD wavelength pairs are diminished.
   For ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) measurements the
   use of BDM (1995) or SER (2014) is recommended.
   For satellite retrieval the presently widely used data of BDM (1995)
   should be used because SER (2014) seems less suitable for retrievals
   that use wavelengths close to 300 nm due to a deficiency in the
   signal-to-noise ratio in the SER (2014) dataset.
   The work of ACSO also showed:
   The need to continue laboratory cross-section measurements of ozone of
   highest quality. The importance of careful characterization of the
   uncertainties of the laboratory measurements.
   The need to extend the scope of such studies to other wavelength ranges
   (particularly to cover not only the Huggins band but also the comparison
   with the mid-infrared region).
   The need for regular cooperation of experts in spectral laboratory
   measurements and specialists in atmospheric (ozone) measurements.},

Volume = {13},
Pages = {415-438},
Abstract = {Spectral characterization of super-Earth atmospheres for planets
   orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarf stars is a key focus in
   exoplanet science. A central challenge is to understand and predict the
   expected spectral signals of atmospheric biosignatures (species
   associated with life). Our work applies a global-mean
   radiative-convective-photochemical column model assuming a planet with
   an Earth-like biomass and planetary development. We investigated planets
   with gravities of 1g and 3g and a surface pressure of 1 bar around
   central stars with spectral classes from M0 to M7. The spectral signals
   of the calculated planetary scenarios have been presented in an earlier
   work by Rauer and colleagues. The main motivation of the present work is
   to perform a deeper analysis of the chemical processes in the planetary
   atmospheres. We apply a diagnostic tool, the Pathway Analysis Program,
   to explore the photochemical pathways that form and destroy biosignature
   species. Ozone is a potential biosignature for complex life. An
   important result of our analysis is a shift in the ozone photochemistry
   from mainly Chapman production (which dominates in Earth's stratosphere)
   to smog-dominated ozone production for planets in the habitable zone of
   cooler (M5-M7)-class dwarf stars. This result is associated with a lower
   energy flux in the UVB wavelength range from the central star, hence
   slower planetary atmospheric photolysis of molecular oxygen, which slows
   the Chapman ozone production. This is important for future atmospheric
   characterization missions because it provides an indication of different
   chemical environments that can lead to very different responses of
   ozone, for example, cosmic rays. Nitrous oxide, a biosignature for
   simple bacterial life, is favored for low stratospheric UV conditions,
   that is, on planets orbiting cooler stars. Transport of this species
   from its surface source to the stratosphere where it is destroyed can
   also be a key process. Comparing 1g with 3g scenarios, our analysis
   suggests it is important to include the effects of interactive
   chemistry.},

abstract = {The effective ground state potential energy function of the ozone
molecule near the C2v equilibrium configuration was obtained in a least-squares
fit to the largest sample of experimental, high-resolution vibration–rotation data
used for this purpose so far. The fitting is based on variational calculations
carried out with the extended Morse Oscillator Rigid Bender Internal Dynamics model.
The potential function is expanded in Morse-type functions of the stretching
variables and in cosine of the bending angle. The present calculation produces
results in significantly better agreement with experiment than previous determinations
of the potential energy surface, and the energies predicted with the new surface
are sufficiently accurate to be useful for the assignment of new high-resolution
spectra. The rms (root-mean-square) deviation of the fit of rovibrational data
up to J = 5 is 0.02 cm−1. For the set of all 60 band centers of the 16O3 molecule
included in the Atlas of Ozone Line Parameters, the rms deviation is 0.025 cm−1,
and for all band centers determined so far from high-resolution spectra, including
those recently observed and assigned in Reims corresponding to highly excited
stretching and bending vibrations (v1 + v2 + v3 = 6), the rms deviation is 0.1
cm−1. The “dark states” that produce resonance perturbations in the observed
bands are described with experimental accuracy up to the (v1v2v3) = (080) state.
Extrapolation tests demonstrate the predictive power of the potential function
obtained: rotational extrapolation up to J = 10 for the 11 lowest vibrational
states results in an rms deviation of 0.06cm−1. Also, vibrational energies measured
by low-resolution Raman spectroscopy (which were not included in the input data
for the fit) are calculated within the experimental accuracy (rms = 1.6 cm−1) of
the experimental values up to the dissociation limit. The statistical analysis
suggests that the accuracy of the equilibrium geometry and force constants of the
molecule is considerably improved relative to previous determinations. The long-range
behavior of the fitted potential at the dissociation limit O3 → O2 + O shows very
good agreement with experimental data. The new potential energy surface was used
to predict the band centers of the isotopomers 17O3 and 18O3.},

Title = {{Stratospheric ozone depletion: A review of concepts and history}},
Journal = {Rev. Geophys.},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {275-316},
Abstract = {Stratospheric ozone depletils on through catalytic chemistry involving
   man-made chlorofluorocarbons is an area of focus in the study of
   geophysics and one of the global environmental issues of the twentieth
   century. This review presents a brief history of the science of ozone
   depletion and describes a conceptual framework to explain the key
   processes involved, with a focus on chemistry. Observations that may be
   considered as evidence (fingerprints) of ozone depletion due to
   chlorofluorocarbons are explored, and the related gas phase and surface
   chemistry is described. Observations of ozone and of chlorine-related
   trace gases near 40 km provide evidence that gas phase chemistry has
   indeed currently depleted about 10\% of the stratospheric ozone there as
   predicted, and the vertical and horizontal structures of this depletion
   are fingerprints for that process. More striking changes are observed
   each austral spring in Antarctica, where about half of the total ozone
   column is depleted each September, forming the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Measurements of large amounts of ClO, a key ozone destruction catalyst,
   are among the finger- prints showing that human releases of
   chlorofluorocarbons are the primary cause of this change. Enhanced ozone
   depletion in the Antarctic and Arctic regions is linked to heterogeneous
   chlorine chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of polar stratospheric
   clouds at cold temperatures. Observations also show that some of the
   same heterogeneous chemistry occurs on the surfaces of particles present
   at midlatitudes as well, and the abundances of these particles are
   enhanced following explosive volcanic eruptions. The partitioning of
   chlorine between active forms that destroy ozone and inert reservoirs
   that sequester it is a central part of the framework for our
   understanding of the 40-km ozone decline, the Antarctic ozone hole, the
   recent Arctic ozone losses in particularly cold years, and the
   observation of record midlatitude ozone depletion after the major
   eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the early 1990s. As human use of
   chlorofluorocarbons continues to decrease, these changes throughout the
   ozone layer are expected to gradually reverse during the twenty-first
   century.},

abstract = {The 2ν1+ ν2+ 3ν3band of ozone, which occurs in the 5700-cm−1region,
has been observed for the first time using a Fourier Transform Spectrometer,
operating at 0.008 cm−1resolution and with a large pathlength × pressure product
(3216 cm × 28.3 Torr). The assignment of rotation–vibration transitions has been
done for J up to 38 and Ka up to 11, respectively, after many difficulties due to
a Coriolis coupling between (213) and (420) states. In this work we show how this
one, which occurs between closed band centers (4 cm−1) but corresponds to ∑iΔvi= 6,
strongly perturbs energy levels and leads to a difficulty in assignments.
In particular we show the deviations for various types of J and Ka as large as 1
cm−1, with respect to the calculations performed without account of this resonance.
The final calculation for the 212 rovibrational states is very satisfactory, as
the r.m.s. is 2.5 × 10−3cm−1, near the experimental accuracy, with meaningful
spectroscopic Hamiltonian parameters. Rovibrational lines intensities of the 2ν1+ ν2+ 3ν3band
were measured, and the value of the transition moment has been recovered. Finally
a complete list of line positions and intensities was calculated (with a cut-off
of 3 × 10−26cm−1/molecule cm−1) leading to a total band intensity of
Sv= 3.118 10−23cm−1/molecule cm−2at 296 K.},
