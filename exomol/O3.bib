Title = {{easonal Changes in the Vertical Structure of Ozone in the Martian Lower
   Atmosphere and Its Relationship to Water Vapor}}
Journal =JGRP
Year = {2022},
Volume = {127},
Abstract = {The mid-infrared channel of the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS MIR)
   onboard the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is capable of observing the
   infrared absorption of ozone (O-3) in the atmosphere of Mars. During
   solar occulations, the 003 <- 000 band (3,000-3,060 cm(-1)) is observed
   with spectral sampling of similar to 0.045 cm(-1). Around the equinoxes
   in both hemispheres and over the southern winters, we regularly observe
   around 200-500 ppbv of O-3 below 30 km. The warm southern summers, near
   perihelion, produce enough atmospheric moisture that O-3 is not
   detectable at all, and observations are rare even at high northern
   latitudes. During the northern summers, water vapor is restricted to
   below 10 km, and an O-3 layer (100-300 ppbv) is visible between 20 and
   30 km. At this same time, the aphelion cloud belt forms, condensing
   water vapor and allowing O-3 to build up between 30 and 40 km. A
   comparison to vertical profiles of water vapor and temperature in each
   season reveals that water vapor abundance is controlled by atmospheric
   temperature, and H2O and O-3 are anti-correlated as expected. When the
   atmosphere cools, over time or over altitude, water vapor condenses
   (observed as a reduction in its mixing ratio) and the production of odd
   hydrogen species is reduced, which allows O-3 to build up. Conversely,
   warmer temperatures lead to water vapor enhancements and ozone loss. The
   LMD Mars Global Climate Model is able to reproduce vertical structure
   and seasonal changes of temperature, H2O, and O-3 that we observe.
   However, the observed O-3 abundance is larger by factors between 2 and
   6, indicating important differences in the rate of odd-hydrogen
   photochemistry.},

Title = {Assessment of the quality of ACE-FTS stratospheric ozone data},

Pages = {1233-1249},
Abstract = {For the past 17 years, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier
   Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) instrument on the Canadian SCISAT
   satellite has been measuring profiles of atmospheric ozone. The latest
   operational versions of the level 2 ozone data are versions 3.6 and 4.1.
   This study characterizes how both products compare with correlative data
   from other limb-sounding satellite instruments, namely MAESTRO, MLS,
   OSIRIS, SABER, and SMR. In general, v3.6, with respect to the other
   instruments, exhibits a smaller bias (which is on the order of similar
   to 3 \%) in the middle stratosphere than v4.1 (similar to 2 \%-9 \%);
   however, the bias exhibited in the v4.1 data tends to be more stable,
   i.e. not changing significantly over time in any altitude region. In the
   lower stratosphere, v3.6 has a positive bias of about 3 \%-5 \% that is
   stable to within +/- 1 \% per decade, and v4.1 has a bias on the order
   of -1 \% to +5 \% and is also stable to within +/- 1 \% per decade. In
   the middle stratosphere, v3.6 has a positive bias of similar to 3 \%
   with a significant negative drift on the order of 0.5 \%-2.5 \% per
   decade, and v4.1 has a positive bias of 2 \%-9 \% that is stable to
   within +/- 0.5 \% per decade. In the upper stratosphere, v3.6 has a
   positive bias that increases with altitude up to similar to 16 \% and a
   significant negative drift on the order of 2 \%-3 \% per decade, and
   v4.1 has a positive bias that increases with altitude up to similar to
   15 \% and is stable to within +/- 1 \% per decade. Estimates indicate
   that both versions 3.6 and 4.1 have precision values on the order of
   0.1-0.2 ppmv below 20 km and above 45 km (similar to 5 \%-10 \%,
   depending on altitude). Between 20 and 45 km, the estimated v3.6
   precision of similar to 4 \%-6 \% is better than the estimated v4.1
   precision of similar to 6 \%-10 \%.},

Volume = {{27}},
Abstract = {{The first part of this review is a brief reminder of general information
   concerning atmospheric ozone, particularly related to its formation,
   destruction, observations of its decrease in the stratosphere, and its
   increase in the troposphere as a result of anthropogenic actions and
   solutions. A few words are said about the abandonment of the Airbus
   project Alliance, which was expected to be the substitute of the
   supersonic Concorde. This project is over due to the theoretical
   evaluation of the impact of a fleet in the stratosphere and has been
   replaced by the A380, which is now operating. The largest part is
   devoted to calculations and observations of the transitions in the
   infrared range and their applications for the atmosphere based both on
   effective models (Hamiltonian, symmetry rules, and dipole moments) and
   ab initio calculations. The complementarities of the two approaches are
   clearly demonstrated, particularly for the creation of an exhaustive
   line list consisting of more than 300,000 lines reaching experimental
   accuracies (from 0.00004 to 0.001 cm(-1)) for positions and a sub
   percent for the intensities in the 10 microns region. This contributes
   to definitively resolving the issue of the observed discrepancies
   between line intensity data in different spectral regions: between the
   infrared and ultraviolet ranges, on the one hand, and between 10 and 5
   microns on the other hand. The following section is devoted to the
   application of recent work to improve the knowledge about the behavior
   of potential function at high energies. A controversial issue related to
   the shape of the potential function in the transition state range near
   the dissociation is discussed.}},

Title = {{Towards the intensity consistency of the ozone bands in the infrared
   range: Ab initio corrections to the S\&MPO database}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{272}},
Abstract = {{Accurate knowledge of line parameters, and particularly line intensities
   is of primary importance for satellite, ground based and balloon
   measurements of the ozone concentration in the atmosphere.
   Self-consistency in absolute band intensities of ozone in various
   spectral intervals is necessary to avoid discrepancies in the
   atmospheric ozone retrieval from different windows. Difficulties in
   precise experimental characterization of absolute line intensities of
   this unstable molecule are well known leading to many significant
   deviations in published intensity values and in spectroscopic
   compilations. Ab initio intensities computed from the dipole moment
   functions of our previous works (Tyuterev et al. JCP 2017;146:064304;
   JCP 2019;150:184303) have permitted achieving a consistency between
   Stark-effect measurements and various databases in 10 and 5 pm in a good
   agreement with the most accurate recent experiments. In this paper we
   extend ab initio corrections to available line lists of ozone band
   intensities in wider IR range up to the bands with four vibrational
   quanta. About 40\% of intensities were corrected in the 0 - 4122 cm(-1)
   range for thirty cold and hot bands of the main ozone O-16(3)
   isotopologue. Most of them, but not all, were obtained using band
   specific scaling factors ranging from 0.75 to 1.17 making quite
   significant changes in the absolute values. The full line lists
   containing corrected line intensities in the spectral intervals
   considered in the paper are provided in the Supplementary material for
   this work. The resulting line list is now available on the web site of
   the ``Spectroscopy and Molecular Properties of Ozone{''} (S\&MPO)
   information system (http://smpo.iao.ru; http://smpo.univ-reims.fr). A
   large part of this line list including the ab initio correction reported

Title = {{Detection and assignment of ozone bands near 95\% of the dissociation
threshold: Ultrasensitive experiments for probing potential energy function and vibrational dynamics}},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
pages = {052804},
Abstract = {Ozone formation and depletion play a key role in various physical and
   chemical atmospheric processes which remain to be understood in more
   detail. The modeling of such phenomena based on ozone dynamics
   calculations requires a detailed knowledge of quantum states, transition
   probabilities, and ozone potential energy surface (PES) near the
   dissociation threshold D-0. Knowledge of highly excited rovibrational
   states with energies approaching D-0 is necessary for a reliable
   interpretation of satellite measurements of the ozone absorption or
   emission in the upper atmosphere in nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium
   conditions. In addition, these states provide an ideal probe of PESs
   computed by ab initio methods but their detection by absorption
   spectroscopy is particularly challenging due to the sharp decrease of
   the intensity with the energy of the corresponding vibrational
   combination and overtone bands. In this work, two very high-energy
   vibrational bands are detected by high sensitivity cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy providing a noise equivalent absorption alpha(min) on the
   order of a few 10(-11) cm(-1). The corresponding cold bands, assigned as
   nu(1) + 6 nu(2) + 3 nu(3) and 6 nu(1) + nu(2) + nu(3) centered at 7969
   and 7993 cm(-1) , respectively, are about nine orders of magnitude less
   intense than the well-known nu(3) fundamental band near 10 mu m. The
   spectrum analysis allowed for the experimental determination of 240
   rovibrational energy levels of the upper vibrational states. The
   corresponding rotational patterns, located between 93.1\% and 96.7\% of
   the dissociation threshold, are the most excited ones measured so far by
   absorption spectroscopy. The values of the band centers and rotational
   constants derived from the spectrum analysis provide further
   confirmation of the absence of an activation barrier on the
   minimum-energy path towards the dissociation threshold {[}Tyuterev et
   al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 143002 (2014)]. The vibrational dynamics is
   discussed in the context of the radiative transition probabilities and
   related Einstein coefficients for the observed bands. Another important
   question in the context of the nuclear dynamics concerns the interaction
   among the three identical potential wells of the ozone molecule in the
   ground electronic state, which appears to be due to the Jahn-Teller
   effect. Recent theoretical results accounting for the three potential
   wells in a full symmetry approach predicted that vibration states should
   exhibit deviations from the conventional one-potential-well ab initio
   calculations, near the dissociation threshold. In the present work, we
   observe a better agreement of the experimentally determined energy value
   with the three-wells prediction for the (1,6,3) vibrational state
   involving a large simultaneous excitation of both bending (nu(2) = 6)
   and asymmetric stretch (nu(3) = 3) vibrations pointing towards a nearby
   well. This could be tentatively interpreted as a manifestation of the
   three-wells effect.},

   rovibrational states of the complex}},
Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {9168-9180},
Abstract = {The cycle of formation and destruction of ozone is an important process
   in the atmosphere. A key step in the formation process is the
   stabilization of a metastable ozone molecule, which occurs through
   energy transfer: usually a highly excited ozone molecule loses the
   excess energy through inelastic collisions with a third body (M).
   However, the details of this energy transfer mechanism are still not
   well known and one of the reasons has been the lack of an accurate
   potential energy surface (PES). In theoretical studies, Ar is often
   selected as the third body when considering O-3-M dynamics. However,
   electronic structure calculations have not previously been reported for
   the complex. In this paper we benchmark the electronic structure for
   this system, and present our first steps towards constructing a fully
   flexible 6D PES by obtaining a 3D PES in the rigid rotor approximation.
   For this purpose, to benchmark the non-bonded interactions, we performed
   ab initio electronic structure calculations using explicitly-correlated
   coupled-cluster theory extended to the complete basis set limit
   (CCSD(T)-F12b/CBS). A multireference-based protocol suitable to describe
   the 6D flexible system was developed using the explicitly-correlated
   multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI-F12) method.
   Subsequently, we used the AUTOSURF code to construct 3D PESs for each of
   the two methods with global root-mean-squared errors of less than 1
   cm(-1). The PES is characterized by two equivalent wells on either face
   of the ozone molecule consistent with the symmetry of the system.
   Calculations of the rovibrational levels for the complex using the
   Multiconfigurational Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method provide
   insight into the states and dynamics of the system. Based on symmetry
   analysis, the allowed states and transitions were obtained: the
   transition frequencies and calculated rotational constants were then
   compared with previously reported experimental measurements. The
   isotopic effect was also studied using the (OOO)-O-16-O-18-O-16 and
   (OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18 isotopologues. Roughly a doubling in the density of
   allowed states is observed when the symmetry of the ozone molecule is
   broken.},

   ultrashort deep ultraviolet radiation sources. The rapidity of ozone
   photolysis with predicted values of a few tens of femtoseconds renders
   both ultrashort pump and probe pulses indispensable to capture this

Abstract = {The theoretical approach developed by the authors in order to account

   applied taking into account explicitly the isotopic masses of the

   classical trajectory calculations on the potential surface of Schinke a

   confirming therefore the higher accuracy of the TKTHS PES. However, the
   present theoretical thermal rate constant still remains below the
   measured rate, maybe due to the neglect of non-adiabtic couplings.

Title = {{Several levels of theory for description of isotope effects in ozone:
   Effect of resonance lifetimes and channel couplings}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2018},
Volume = {149},
Abstract = {In this paper, two levels of theory are developed to determine the role
   of scattering resonances in the process of ozone formation. At the lower
   theory level, we compute resonance lifetimes in the simplest possible
   way, by neglecting all couplings between the diabatic vibrational
   channels in the problem. This permits to determine the effect of
   ``shape{''} resonances, trapped behind the centrifugal barrier and
   populated by quantum tunneling. At the next level of theory, we include
   couplings between the vibrational channels, which permits to determine
   the role of Feshbach resonances and interaction of different reaction
   pathways on the global PES of ozone. Pure shape resonances are found to
   contribute little to the overall recombination process since they occur
   rather infrequently in the spectrum, in the vicinity of the top of the
   centrifugal barrier only. Moreover, the associated isotope effects are
   found to disagree with experimental data. By contrast, Feshbach-type
   resonances are found to make dominant contribution to the process. They
   occur in a broader range of spectrum, and their density of states is
   much higher. The properties of Feshbach resonances are studied in
   detail. They explain the isotopic zeta-effect, giving theoretical
   prediction in good agreement with experiments for both singly and doubly
   substituted ozone molecules. Importantly, Feshbach resonances also
   contribute to the isotopic zeta-effect, moving theoretical predictions
   in the right direction. Some differences with experimental data remain,
   which indicates that there may be another additional source of the
   zeta-effect. Published by AIP Publishing.},

Title = {{Excited States of Methylene, Polyenes, and Ozone from Heat-Bath
   Configuration Interaction}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {2714-2722},
Abstract = {The electronically excited states of methylene (CH2), ethylene (C2H4),
   butadiene (C4H6), hexatriene (C6H8), and ozone (O-3) have long proven
   challenging due to their complex mixtures of static and dynamic
   correlations. The semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction
   (SHCI) algorithm, which efficiently and systematically approaches the
   full configuration interaction (FCI) limit, is used to provide close
   approximations to the FCI energies in these systems. This article
   presents the largest FCI-level calculation to date on hexatriene, using
   a polarized double-zeta basis (ANO-L-pVDZ), which gives rise to a
   Hilbert space containing more than 10(38) determinants. These
   calculations give vertical excitation energies of 5.58 and 5.59 eV,
   respectively, for the 2(1)A(g) and 1(1)B(u) states, showing that they
   are nearly degenerate. The same excitation energies in
   butadiene/ANO-L-pVDZ were found to be 6.58 and 6.45 eV. In addition to
   these benchmarks, our calculations strongly support the presence of a
   previously hypothesized ring-minimum species of ozone that lies 1.3 eV
   higher than the open-ring-minimum energy structure and is separated from
   it by a barrier of 1.11 eV.},

   Symmetry effect and mass effect}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2018},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {9177-9190},
Abstract = {The essential components of theory for the description of isotope
   effects in recombination reaction that forms ozone are presented,
   including the introduction of three reaction pathways for symmetric and
   asymmetric isotopomers, a brief review of relevant experimental data for
   singly- and doubly substituted isotopologues, the definitions of
   zeta-effect and eta-effect, and the introduction of isotopic enrichment
   delta. Two levels of theory are developed to elucidate the role of
   molecular symmetry, atomic masses, vibrational zero-point energies, and
   rotational excitations in the recombination process. The issue of
   symmetry is not trivial, since the important factors, such as 1/2 and 2,
   appear in seven different places in the formalism. It is demonstrated
   that if all these effects are taken into account properly, then no
   anomalous isotope effects emerge. At the next level of theory, a model
   is considered in which one scattering resonance (sitting right at the
   top of centrifugal barrier) is introduced per ro-vibrational channel. It
   is found that this approach is equivalent to statistical treatment with
   partition functions at the transition state. Accurate calculations using
   hyper-spherical coordinates show that no isotope effects come from
   difference in the number of states. In contrast, differences in
   vibrational and rotational energies lead to significant isotope effects.
   However, those effects appear to be local, found for the rather extreme
   values of rotational quantum numbers. They largely cancel when rate
   coefficients are computed for the thermal distribution of rotational
   excitations. Although large isotope effects (observed in experiments)
   are not reproduced here, this level of theory can be used as a
   foundation for more detailed computational treatment, with accurate
   information about resonance energies and lifetimes computed and
   included.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2018},
Volume = {218},
Pages = {231-247},
Abstract = {Fifteen bands of the most abundant asymmetric ozone isotopomer
   (OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18 were observed in new spectra generated from various
   O-18(2)/O-16(2) mixtures in the 950-3850 cm(-1) range. These bands were
   fully analyzed, leading to the assignment of a total of 9976
   transitions, corresponding to 7030 upper state rovibrational energy
   levels. The analyses include also six ``dark{''} vibrational states
   perturbing upper states of the observed bands through anharmonic and
   Coriolis resonance coupling. The modeling of very congested spectra
   simultaneously containing lines of six isotopic species resulted to the
   root mean squares deviations that vary from 0.001 to 0.003 cm(-1) in
   line positions, not exceeding the experimental accuracy. To this end,
   two different approaches both guided by the ab initio theory were
   employed. Below 2500 cm(-1), all the interacting vibrational states
   involved in the usual polyad scheme corresponding to the same total
   stretching excitation were observed. In these cases all symmetry allowed
   Coriolis and anharmonic coupling terms were initially predicted from ab
   initio potential energy surface (PES) using the contact transformation
   method. The major coupling terms were then held fixed to theoretical
   values during the least-square fits of the observed transitions in order
   to avoid correlations among adjusted parameters. Above 2500 cm(-1), some
   bands were too weak to be observed. In these cases, the observations did
   not permit including complete stretching polyads and we used truncated
   effective models, for which the theory helped to predict initial values
   of the band centers, their assignments and vibrational dependence of
   A(v) B-v, C-v rotational constants. The final comparison of fifteen
   experimentally detected and ab initio band centers of
   (OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18 gave the rms deviation of 0.59 cm(-1). This drops
   down to 0.09 cm(-1) when using the PES that had been empirically
   optimized to O-16(3) data. The (observed-predicted) rms deviation for
   A(v) and B-v is very small-about 0.1\%. Average deviations for C-v are
   somewhat larger similar to 0.8\% as they are affected by Coriolis
   resonances. Effective dipole transition moment parameters were either
   fitted or estimated from a qualitative comparison of observed and
   simulated spectra involving overlapping contributions of various
   isotopic species. The line lists built from data reduction models
   containing about 51,100 transitions are provided in Supplementary

Abstract = {Monitoring ozone concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere using
   spectroscopic methods is a major activity which undertaken both from the
   ground and from space. However there are long-running issues of
   consistency between measurements made at infrared (IR) and ultraviolet
   (UV) wavelengths. In addition, key O-3 IR bands at 10 mu m, 5 mu m and 3
   mu m also yield results which differ by a few percent when used for
   retrievals. These problems stem from the underlying laboratory
   measurements of the line intensities. Here we use quantum chemical
   techniques, first principles electronic structure and variational
   nuclear-motion calculations, to address this problem. A new
   high-accuracy ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is computed. Several
   spectroscopically-determined potential energy surfaces (PESs) are
   constructed by fitting to empirical energy levels in the region below
   7000 cm(-1) starting from an ab initio PES. Nuclear motion calculations
   using these new surfaces allow the unambiguous determination of the
   intensities of 10 mu m band transitions, and the computation of the
   intensities of 10 mu m and 5 mu m bands within their experimental error.
   A decrease in intensities within the 3 mu m is predicted which appears
   consistent with atmospheric retrievals. The PES and DMS form a suitable
   starting point both for the computation of comprehensive ozone line
   lists and for future calculations of electronic transition intensities.

   investigate the presence or absence of such a topological phase. On a

Abstract = {Exoplanet hunting efforts have revealed the prevalence of exotic worlds
   with diverse properties, including Earth-sized bodies, which has fueled
   our endeavor to search for life beyond the Solar System. Accumulating
   experiences in astrophysical, chemical, and climatological
   characterization of uninhabitable planets are paving the way to
   characterization of potentially habitable planets. In this paper, we
   review our possibilities and limitations in characterizing temperate
   terrestrial planets with future observational capabilities through the
   2030s and beyond, as a basis of a broad range of discussions on how to
   advance astrobiology with exoplanets. We discuss the observability of
   not only the proposed biosignature candidates themselves but also of
   more general planetary properties that provide circumstantial evidence,
   since the evaluation of any biosignature candidate relies on its
   context. Characterization of temperate Earth-sized planets in the coming
   years will focus on those around nearby late-type stars. The James Webb
   Space Telescope (JWST) and later 30-meter-class ground-based telescopes
   will empower their chemical investigations. Spectroscopic studies of
   potentially habitable planets around solar-type stars will likely
   require a designated spacecraft mission for direct imaging, leveraging
   technologies that are already being developed and tested as part of the
   Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. Successful
   initial characterization of a few nearby targets will be an important
   touchstone toward a more detailed scrutiny and a larger survey that are
   envisioned beyond 2030. The broad outlook this paper presents may help

spectroscopic issue}},
Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Tech.},

Pages = {4707-4723},
Abstract = {Discrepancies in ozone retrievals in MIPAS channels A (685-970 cm(-1))
   and AB (1020-1170 cm(-1)) have been a long-standing problem in MIPAS
   data analysis, amounting to an interchannel bias (AB-A) of up to 8\%
   between ozone volume mixing ratios in the altitude range 3040 km. We
   discuss various candidate explanations, among them forward model and
   retrieval algorithm errors, interchannel calibration inconsistencies and
   spectroscopic data inconsistencies. We show that forward-modelling
   errors as well as errors in the retrieval algorithm can be ruled out as
   an explanation because the bias can be reproduced with an entirely
   independent retrieval algorithm (GEOFIT), relying on a different forward
   radiative transfer model. Instrumental and calibration issues can also
   be refuted as an explanation because ozone retrievals based on
   balloon-borne measurements with a different instrument (MIPAS-B) and an
   independent level-1 data processing scheme produce a rather similar
   interchannel bias. Thus, spectroscopic inconsistencies in the MIPAS
   database used for ozone retrieval are practically the only reason left.
   To further investigate this issue, we performed retrievals using
   additional spectroscopic databases. Various versions of the HITRAN
   database generally produced rather similar channel AB-A differences. Use
   of a different database, namely GEISA-2015, led to similar results in
   channel AB, but to even higher ozone volume mixing ratios for channel A
   retrievals, i.e. to a reversal of the bias. We show that the differences
   in MIPAS channel A retrievals result from about 13\% lower
   air-broadening coefficients of the strongest lines in the GEISA-2015
   database. Since the errors in line intensity of the major lines used in
   MIPAS channels A and AB are reported to be considerably lower than the
   observed bias, we posit that a major part of the channel AB-A
   differences can be attributed to inconsistent air-broadening
   coefficients as well. To corroborate this assumption we show some
   clearly inconsistent air-broadening coefficients in the HITRAN-2008
   database. The interchannel bias in retrieved ozone amounts can be
   reduced by increasing the air-broadening coefficients of the lines in
   MIPAS channel AB in the HITRAN-2008 database by 6 \%-8 \%.},

Abstract = {The room temperature (294.09 K) absorption cross section of ozone at the

   region used by a variety of ozone remote sensing techniques, an
   absorption cross-section value of sigma = 16.470 x 10(-21) cm(2) was
   measured. The measurement provides the currently most accurate direct
   photometric absorption value of ozone in the UV with an expanded
   (coverage factor k = 2) standard uncertainty u (sigma) = 31 x 10(-24)
   cm(2), corresponding to a relative level of 2 parts per thousand. The
   measurements are most compatible with a relative temperature coefficient
   c(T) = sigma(-1) partial derivative(T)sigma = 0.0031 K-1 at 294 K. The
   cross section and its uncertainty value were obtained using generalised
   linear regression with correlated uncertainties. It will serve as a
   reference for ozone absorption spectra required for the long-term remote
   sensing of atmospheric ozone in the Huggins bands. The comparison with
   commonly used absorption cross-section data sets for remote sensing
   reveals a possible bias of about 2 \%. This could partly explain a 4 \%
   discrepancy between UV and IR remote sensing data and indicates that
   further studies will be required to reach the accuracy goal of 1 \% in
   atmospheric reference spectra.},

used for the fit of ab initio points provides better behavior for large nuclear
displacements than that of previous studies. Various DMS models were derived and
tested. Vibration-rotation line intensities of 16O3 were calculated from these
ab initio surfaces by the variational method using two different potential functions
determined in our previous works. For the first time, a very good agreement of
first principle calculations with the experiment was obtained for the line-by-line
intensities in rotationally resolved ozone spectra in a large far- and mid-infrared
range. This includes high overtone and combination bands up to Î”V = 6. A particular
challenge was a correct description of the B-type bands (even Î”V3 values) that
represented major difficulties for the previous ab initio investigations and for
the empirical spectroscopic models. The major patterns of various B-type bands
were correctly described without empirically adjusted dipole moment parameters.
For the 10 Î¼m range, which is of key importance for the atmospheric ozone retrievals,
our ab initio intensity results are within the experimental error margins. The
theoretical values for the strongest lines of the Î½3 band lie in general between
two successive versions of HITRAN (HIgh-resolution molecular TRANsmission) empirical
database that corresponded to most extended available sets of observations. The
overall qualitative agreement in a large wavenumber range for rotationally resolved
cold and hot ozone bands up to about 6000 cmâˆ’1 is achieved here for the first time.
These calculations reveal that several weak bands are yet missing from available
spectroscopic databases.},

Journal = JMS,
Year = {2017},
Volume = {331},
Pages = {89-105},
Abstract = {The vibrational spectroscopic description of the ozone molecule 1603 in
   its electronic ground state X(1)A(1) is presented in the framework of a
   simple local model, where Morse potentials are associated with both
   stretching and bending modes. The Hamiltonian is written in terms of
   internal coordinates considering the local mode character of the ozone
   molecule. Later on an algebraic representation in terms of Morse ladder
   operators is introduced through a linear approximation in the expansion
   of the coordinates and momenta. Three polyads are considered in our
   study: P-11 = v(1) + v(3) + v(2) + P-21 = 2(v(1) + v(3)) + v(2), and
   P-32 = 3(v(1) + v(3)) + 2v(2), as suggested by resonances derived from
   the fundamentals as well as from previous variational analysis. The best
   description is provided by the P-11 polyad scheme, yielding an rms
   deviation of 1.85 cm(-1) for a fit involving 121 energy levels.
   Considering the other two polyads the description is less accurate: rms
   = 2.78 cm(-1) for polyad P21 and rms = 2.63 cm(-1) for polyad P-32,
   considering 99 and 100 energy levels, respectively. These fits represent
   the best descriptions in the framework of an algebraic approach. In
   addition, since our algebraic model keeps the connection with
   configuration space, the force constants derived from the three fits
   have been estimated. We have found that all the available experimental
   energies may be assigned at least to one of the three fits. As the
   energy increases the eigenstates obtained from different polyad schemes
   differ. This fact paves the way to establish a polyad brealdng approach
   as a next step to improve the description. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

   time-series dataset spanning over 34 years (January 1979-December 2012)

   Statistically significant (p-value <0.05) long-term trends in TOC were
   estimated in the deseasonalized TOC time series. The role of multiple
   natural and anthropogenic factors: quasi biennial oscillations (QBO),
   El-Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO), cyclic variation in solar activity
   (SA), and ozone depleting substances (ODS) was investigated to explain
   the long-term trends in TOC over Indian region. Over sub-tropical Indian
   region (25.0 degrees N- 40.0 degrees N), declining long-term linear
   trends were estimated, which varied from -0.30\% to -1.10\% per decade.
   Interestingly a positive long-term linear-trend (0.10-0.30\% per decade)
   was observed over equatorial-tropical part of Indian region. No
   statistically significant longterm trend was observed for 30mb

   however, a positive long-term linear trend of magnitude 17.00 +/- 1.18\%

   a proxy for ODS, and a negative long-term linear trend of magnitude

Abstract = {The prospect of performing the open -> cyclic ozone isomerization has
   attracted much research attention. Here we explore this consideration
   theoretically by performing quantum optimal control calculations to
   demonstrate the important role that excited-state dissociation channels
   could play in the isomerization transformation. In the calculations we
   use a three-state, one-dimensional dynamical model constructed from the
   lowest five (1)A' potential energy curves obtained with high-level ab
   initio calculations. Besides the laser field-dipole couplings between
   all three states, this model also includes the diabatic coupling between
   the two excited states at an avoided crossing leading to competing
   dissociation channels that can further hinder the isomerization process.
   The present three-state optimal control simulations examine two possible
   control pathways previously considered in a two-state model, and reveal
   that only one of the pathways is viable, achieving a robust similar to
   95\% yield to the cyclic target in the three-state model. This work
   represents a step towards an ultimate model for the open -> cyclic ozone
   transformation capable of giving adequate guidance about the necessary

Abstract = {A new accurate global potential energy surface for the ground electronic

   was published fairly recently. The topography near dissociation differs
   significantly from previous surfaces, without spurious submerged reefs
   and corresponding van der Waals wells. This has enabled significantly
   improved descriptions of scattering processes, capturing the negative
   temperature dependence and large kinetic isotope effects in exchange
   reaction rates. The exchange reactivity was found to depend on the
   character of near-threshold resonances and their overlap with reactant
   and product wavefunctions, which in turn are sensitive to the potential.
   Here we present global ``three-well{''} calculations of all bound
   vibrational states of three isotopic combinations of ozone (O-48(3),
   (O2O)-O-16-O-18, (O2O)-O-16-O-17) for J = 0 and J = 1 with a focus on
   the character and density of highly excited states and discuss their

   molecules near dissociation threshold: Application to ozone}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {145},
pages = {114106},
Abstract = {A method for calculations of rotational-vibrational states of triatomic
   molecules up to dissociation threshold (and scattering resonances above
   it) is devised, that combines hyper-spherical coordinates, sequential
   diagonalization-truncation procedure, optimized grid DVR, and complex
   absorbing potential. Efficiency and accuracy of the method and new code
   are tested by computing the spectrum of ozone up to dissociation
   threshold, using two different potential energy surfaces. In both cases
   good agreement with results of previous studies is obtained for the
   lower energy states localized in the deep (similar to 10 000 cm(-1))
   covalent well. Upper part of the bound state spectrum, within 600 cm(-1)
   below dissociation threshold, is also computed and is analyzed in
   detail. It is found that long progressions of symmetric-stretching and
   bending states (up to 8 and 11 quanta, respectively) survive up to
   dissociation threshold and even above it, whereas excitations of the
   asymmetric-stretching overtones couple to the local vibration modes,
   making assignments difficult. Within 140 cm(-1) below dissociation
   threshold, large-amplitude vibrational states of a floppy complex O
   center dot center dot center dot O-2 are formed over the shallow van
   derWaals plateau. These are assigned using two local modes: the
   rocking-motion and the dissociative-motion progressions, up to 6 quanta
   in each, both with frequency similar to 20 cm(-1). Many of these plateau
   states are mixed with states of the covalent well. Interestingly,
   excitation of the rocking-motion helps keeping these states localized
   within the plateau region, by raising the effective barrier. Published

   state and on the lowest excited state of like symmetry in ozone: A
   configuration interaction study}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {144},
pages = {104304},
Abstract = {The metastable ring structure of the ozone 1(1)A(1) ground state, which
   theoretical calculations have shown to exist, has so far eluded
   experimental detection. An accurate prediction for the energy difference
   between this isomer and the lower open structure is therefore of
   interest, as is a prediction for the isomerization barrier between them,
   which results from interactions between the lowest two (1)A(1) states.
   In the present work, valence correlated energies of the 1(1)A(1) state
   and the 2(1)A(1) state were calculated at the 1(1)A(1) open minimum, the
   1(1)A(1) ring minimum, the transition state between these two minima,
   the minimum of the 2(1)A(1) state, and the conical intersection between
   the two states. The geometries were determined at the full-valence
   multi-configuration self-consistent-field level. Configuration
   interaction (CI) expansions up to quadruple excitations were calculated
   with triple-zeta atomic basis sets. The CI expansions based on eight
   different reference configuration spaces were explored. To obtain some
   of the quadruple excitation energies, the method of Correlation Energy
   Extrapolation by Intrinsic Scaling was generalized to the simultaneous
   extrapolation for two states. This extrapolation method was shown to be
   very accurate. On the other hand, none of the CI expansions were found
   to have converged to millihartree (mh) accuracy at the quadruple
   excitation level. The data suggest that convergence to mh accuracy is
   probably attained at the sextuple excitation level. On the 1(1)A(1)
   state, the present calculations yield the estimates of (ring
   minimum-open minimum) similar to 45-50 mh and (transition state-open
   minimum) similar to 85-90 mh. For the (2(1)A(1)-(1)A(1)) excitation
   energy, the estimate of similar to 130-170 mh is found at the open
   minimum and 270-310 mh at the ring minimum. At the transition state, the
   difference (2(1)A(1)-(1)A(1)) is found to be between 1 and 10 mh. The
   geometry of the transition state on the 1(1)A(1) surface and that of the
   minimum on the 2(1)A(1) surface nearly coincide. More accurate
   predictions of the energy differences also require CI expansions to at
   least sextuple excitations with respect to the valence space. For every
   wave function considered, the omission of the correlations of the 2s
   oxygen orbitals, which is a widely used approximation, was found to
   cause errors of about +/-10 mh with respect to the energy differences.

abstract = {Atmospheric ozone concentration measurements mostly depend on
spectroscopic methods that cover different spectral regions. Despite long years
of measurement efforts, the uncertainty goal of 1% in absolute line intensities
has not yet been reached. Multispectral inter-comparisons using both laboratory
and atmospheric studies reveal that important discrepancies exist when ozone columns
are retrieved from different spectral regions. Here, we use ground based FTIR
to study the sensitivity of ozone columns on different spectroscopic parameters
as a function of individual bands for identifying necessary improvements of the
spectroscopic databases. In particular, we examine the degree of consistency that
can be reached in ozone retrievals using spectral windows in the 5 and 10 Î¼m bands
of ozone. Based on the atmospheric spectra, a detailed database inter-comparison
between HITRAN (version 2012), GEISA (version 2011) and S&MPO (as retrieved from
the website at the end of 2015) is made. Data from the 10 Î¼m window are consistent
to better than 1%, but there are larger differences when the windows at 5 Î¼m are
included. The 5 Î¼m results agree with the results from 10 Î¼m within Â±2% for all
databases. Recent S&MPO data are even more consistent with the desired level of 1%,
but spectroscopic data from HITRAN give about 4% higher ozone columns than those
from GEISA. If four sub-windows in the 5 Î¼m band are checked for consistency,
retrievals using GEISA or S&MPO parameters show less dispersion than those using
HITRAN, where one window in the P-branch of the Î½1 + Î½3 band gives about 2% lower
results than the other three. The atmospheric observations are corroborated by a
direct comparison of the spectroscopic databases, using a simple statistical
analysis based on intensity weighted spectroscopic parameters. The bias introduced
by the weighted average approach is investigated and it is negligible if relative
differences between databases do not correlate with line intensities. This is the
case for the comparison of HITRAN with GEISA in the 10 Î¼m region and the agreement
between the simple analysis and the full retrieval is better than 0.1%. At 5 Î¼m
biases might be as high as 1.4%, and the proposed method is thus limited to the
same level of accuracy. Implications of the new data for database improvements and
further studies, in particular in the 5 Î¼m region, are discussed.},

Title = {{Absorption cross-sections of ozone in the ultraviolet and visible
   spectral regions: Status report 2015}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {327},
Pages = {105-121},
Abstract = {The activity ``Absorption Cross-Sections of Ozone{''} (ACSO) started in
   2008 as a joint initiative of the International Ozone Commission (IO3C),
   the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the IGACO
   ({''}Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations{''}) O-3/UV
   subgroup to study, evaluate, and recommend the most suitable ozone
   absorption cross-section laboratory data to be used in atmospheric ozone
   measurements. The evaluation was basically restricted to ozone
   absorption cross-sections in the UV range with particular focus on the
   Huggins band. Up until now, the data of Bass and Paur published in 1985
   (BP, 1985) are still officially recommended for such measurements.
   During the last decade it became obvious that BP (1985) cross-section
   data have deficits for use in advanced space-borne ozone measurements.
   At the same time, it was recognized that the origin of systematic
   differences in ground-based measurements of ozone required further
   investigation, in particular whether the BP (1985) cross-section data
   might contribute to these differences.
   In ACSO, different sets of laboratory ozone absorption cross-section
   data (including their dependence on temperature) of the group of Reims
   (France) (Brion et al., 1993, 1998, 1992, 1995, abbreviated as BDM,
   1995) and those of Serdyuchenko et al. (2014), and Gorshelev et al.
   (2014), (abbreviated as SER, 2014) were examined for use in atmospheric
   ozone measurements in the Huggins band.
   In conclusion, ACSO recommends:
   The spectroscopic data of BP (1985) should no longer be used for
   retrieval of atmospheric ozone measurements
   For retrieval of ground-based instruments of total ozone and ozone
   profile measurements by the Umkehr method performed by Brewer and Dobson
   instruments data of SER (2014) are recommended to be used. When SER
   (2014) is used, the difference between total ozone measurements of
   Brewer and Dobson instruments are very small and the difference between
   Dobson measurements at AD and CD wavelength pairs are diminished.
   For ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) measurements the
   use of BDM (1995) or SER (2014) is recommended.
   For satellite retrieval the presently widely used data of BDM (1995)
   should be used because SER (2014) seems less suitable for retrievals
   that use wavelengths close to 300 nm due to a deficiency in the
   signal-to-noise ratio in the SER (2014) dataset.
   The work of ACSO also showed:
   The need to continue laboratory cross-section measurements of ozone of
   highest quality. The importance of careful characterization of the
   uncertainties of the laboratory measurements.
   The need to extend the scope of such studies to other wavelength ranges
   (particularly to cover not only the Huggins band but also the comparison
   with the mid-infrared region).
   The need for regular cooperation of experts in spectral laboratory
   measurements and specialists in atmospheric (ozone) measurements.},

Abstract = {The O atom exchange reaction, O-16(P-3) + (OO)-O-18-O-18((3)Sigma(-)(g))
   -> (OO)-O-16-O-18((3)Sigma(-)(g)) + O-18(P-3), was investigated at a
   hyperthermal center-of-mass (c.m.) collision energy (E-coll) of 86 kcal
   mol(-1), using a crossed-molecular-beams apparatus and quasiclassical
   trajectory (QCT) calculations. The inelastically scattered O-16 and
   reactively scattered (OO)-O-16-O-18 products were detected with a
   rotatable mass spectrometer employing electron-impact ionization. The
   O-16 atoms are scattered in inelastic collisions in the forward
   direction relative to their initial direction of flight, with most of
   the available energy partitioned into translation. The (OO)-O-16-O-18
   products of reactive collisions are mainly formed through impulsive
   dynamics and are scattered in the forward as well as sideways directions
   relative to the direction of the reagent O-16 atoms, with a slight
   majority of the available energy partitioned into translation (< E-T > =
   58\%) and a significant contribution to internal degrees of freedom.
   Excellent agreement was found between the experimental c.m. angular and
   translational energy distributions of the inelastically scattered O-16
   and reactively scattered (OO)-O-16-O-18 products and those obtained from
   QCT calculations, which were carried out on a ground-state singlet
   electronic potential energy surface. The QCT calculations predicted
   (OO)-O-16-O-18 products that are both highly rotationally and
   vibrationally excited, with j'((OO)-O-16-O-18) up to 150 and
   nu(1)((OO)-O-16-O-18) up to 15, respectively. The QCT simulations
   indicate that the translational energy distribution of the reactively
   scattered (OO)-O-16-O-18 is bimodal, corresponding to two distinct
   interaction mechanisms that are dependent on impact parameter: one at
   impact parameters below similar to 0.5 angstrom and another in the
   vicinity of 1.6 angstrom. Collisions in the former regime produce
   (OO)-O-16-O-18 with internal energy closer to the maximum available
   energy while the latter mechanism, involving strong interaction within
   the O-3 potential well, is responsible for the low-energy peak of the
   product translational distribution. The inelastic collisions also follow
   two basic impact-parameter-dependent mechanisms. At impact parameters
   above 2.1 angstrom, the O-16 atom is reflected from the outer repulsive
   wall of the O-2 molecule, resulting in exclusively forward scattering,
   while collisions at impact parameters below similar to 2 angstrom access
   the O-3 potential well and lead to ejection of either an O-16 or an O-18
   atom. Scattering remains preferentially forward in both cases due to the
   large momentum of the attacking O-16 atom.},

Abstract = {Energies and lifetimes (widths) of vibrational states above the lowest
   dissociation limit of O-16(3) were determined using a previously
   developed efficient approach, which combines hyperspherical coordinates
   and a complex absorbing potential. The calculations are based on a
   recently computed potential energy surface of ozone determined with a
   spectroscopic accuracy {[}Tyuterev et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 134307
   (2013)]. The effect of permutational symmetry on rovibrational dynamics
   and the density of resonance states in O-3 is discussed in detail.
   Correspondence between quantum numbers appropriate for short- and
   long-range parts of wave functions of the rovibrational continuum is
   established. It is shown, by symmetry arguments, that the allowed purely
   vibrational (J = 0) levels of O-16(3) and O-18(3), both made of bosons
   with zero nuclear spin, cannot dissociate on the ground-state potential
   energy surface. Energies and wave functions of bound states of the ozone
   isotopologue O-16(3) with rotational angular momentum J = 0 and 1 up to
   the dissociation threshold were also computed. For bound levels, good
   agreement with experimental energies is found: The rms deviation between
   observed and calculated vibrational energies is 1 cm(-1). Rotational
   constants were determined and used for a simple identification of
   vibrational modes of calculated levels.},

Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Tech.},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {4327-4353},
Abstract = {This paper presents an extensive intercomparison and validation for the
   ozone (O-3) product measured by the two Infrared Atmospheric Sounding
   Interferometers (IASIs) launched on board the MetOp-A and MetOp-B
   satellites in 2006 and in 2012 respectively. IASI O-3 total columns and
   vertical profiles obtained from Fast Optimal Retrievals on Layers for
   IASI (FORLI) v20140922 software (running up until recently) are
   validated against independent observations during the period 2008-2014
   on a global scale. On average for the period 2013-2014, IASI-A and
   IASI-B total ozone columns (TOCs) retrieved using FORLI are consistent,
   with IASI-B providing slightly lower values with a global difference of
   only 0.2 +/- 0.8 \%. The comparison between IASI-A and IASI-B O-3
   vertical profiles shows differences within +/- 2\% over the entire
   altitude range. Global validation results for 7 years of IASI TOCs from
   FORLI against the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) launched
   on board MetOp-A and Brewer-Dobson data show that, on average, IASI
   overestimates the ultraviolet (UV) data by 5-6 \% with the largest
   differences found in the southern high latitudes. The comparison with
   UV-visible SAOZ (Systeme d'Analyse par Observation Zenithale)
   measurements shows a mean bias between IASI and SAOZ TOCs of 2-4 \% in
   the midlatitudes and tropics and 7 \% at the polar circle. Part of the
   discrepancies found at high latitudes can be attributed to the limited
   information content in the observations due to low brightness
   temperatures. The comparison with ozonesonde vertical profiles (limited
   to 30 km) shows that on average IASI with FORLI processing
   underestimates O-3 by similar to 5-15 \% in the troposphere while it
   overestimates O-3 by similar to 10-40 \% in the stratosphere, depending
   on the latitude. The largest relative differences are found in the
   tropical tropopause region; this can be explained by the low O-3 amounts
   leading to large relative errors. In this study, we also evaluate an
   updated version of FORLI-O-3 retrieval software (v20151001), using
   look-up tables recalculated to cover a larger spectral range using the
   latest HITRAN spectroscopic database (HITRAN 2012) and implementing
   numerical corrections. The assessment of the new O-3 product with the
   same set of observations as that used for the validation exercise shows
   a correction of similar to 4 \% for the TOC positive bias when compared
   to the UV ground-based and satellite observations, bringing the overall
   global comparison to similar to 1-2 \% on average. This improvement is
   mainly associated with a decrease in the retrieved O-3 concentration in
   the middle stratosphere (above 30 hPa/25 km) as shown by the comparison
   with ozonesonde data.},

Volume = {121},
Pages = {13088-13112},
Abstract = {In support of future satellite missions that aim to address the current
   shortcomings in measuring air quality from space, NASA's Deriving
   Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved
   Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) field campaign was
   designed to enable exploration of relationships between column
   measurements of trace species relevant to air quality at high spatial
   and temporal resolution. In the DISCOVER-AQ data set, a modest
   correlation (r(2) = 0.45) between ozone (O-3) and formaldehyde (CH2O)
   column densities was observed. Further analysis revealed regional
   variability in the O-3-CH2O relationship, with Maryland having a strong
   relationship when data were viewed temporally and Houston having a
   strong relationship when data were viewed spatially. These differences
   in regional behavior are attributed to differences in volatile organic
   compound (VOC) emissions. In Maryland, biogenic VOCs were responsible
   for similar to 28\% of CH2O formation within the boundary layer column,
   causing CH2O to, in general, increase monotonically throughout the day.
   In Houston, persistent anthropogenic emissions dominated the local
   hydrocarbon environment, and no discernable diurnal trend in CH2O was
   observed. Box model simulations suggested that ambient CH2O mixing
   ratios have a weak diurnal trend (+/- 20\% throughout the day) due to
   photochemical effects, and that larger diurnal trends are associated
   with changes in hydrocarbon precursors. Finally, mathematical
   relationships were developed from first principles and were able to
   replicate the different behaviors seen in Maryland and Houston. While
   studies would be necessary to validate these results and determine the
   regional applicability of the O-3-CH2O relationship, the results
   presented here provide compelling insight into the ability of future
   satellite missions to aid in monitoring near-surface air quality.},

Journal = ACP,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {13627-13632},
Abstract = {Photometric ozone measurements rely upon an accurate value of the ozone
   absorption cross section at 253.65 nm. This has recently been
   re-evaluated by Viallon et al. (2015) as 1.8\% smaller than the accepted
   value (Hearn, 1961) used for the preceding 50 years. Thus, ozone
   measurements that applied the older cross section systematically
   underestimate the amount of ozone in air. We correct the reported
   historical surface data from North America and Europe and find that this
   modest change in cross section has a significant impact on the number of
   locations that are out of compliance with air quality regulations if the
   air quality standards remain the same. We find 18, 23, and 20\%
   increases in the number of sites that are out of compliance with current
   US, Canadian, and European ozone air quality health standards for the
   year 2012. Should the new cross-section value be applied, it would
   impact attainment of air quality standards and compliance with relevant
   clean air acts, unless the air quality target values themselves were
   also changed proportionately. We draw attention to how a small change in
   gas metrology has a global impact on attainment and compliance with
   legal air quality standards. We suggest that further laboratory work to
   evaluate the new cross section is needed and suggest three possible
   technical and policy responses should the new cross section be adopted.},

Abstract = {We study the potential energy surface (PES) of the ozone molecule along

   an antisymmetrized geminal power arranged in a single determinant that

   correlation factor accounts for the dynamics electron correlation. The
   accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by computing the dissociation
   energy and PES for the ozone molecule in three vibrational states:
   symmetric, asymmetric, and scissoring. We find that the employed wave
   function provides a detailed description of rather strongly correlated
   multireference systems, which is in quantitative agreement with

Abstract = {Quantum dynamics at a reactive two-state conical intersection lying

   on the vibrational distributions in the two electronic states at

   contain unique information on the location and shape of the conical

   conceptual approach is demonstrated for the intermediate O-O bond
   stretch distributions which become strongly inverted on adiabatic
   passage through the intersection. It is further demonstrated that
   intermediate distributions can be reconstructed from the photoemission
   spectrum of the dissociating molecule. The illustration, given using

Abstract = {Ozone plays a crucial role in tropospheric chemistry, is the third
   largest contributor to greenhouse radiative forcing after carbon dioxide
   and methane and also a toxic air pollutant affecting human health and
   agriculture. Long-term measurements of tropospheric ozone have been
   performed globally for more than 30 years with UV photometers, all
   relying on the absorption of ozone at the 253.65 nm line of mercury. We
   have re-determined this cross-section and report a value of 11.27 x
   10(-18) cm(2) molecule(-1) with an expanded relative uncertainty of
   0.86\% (coverage factor k= 2). This is lower than the conventional value
   currently in use and measured by Hearn (1961) with a relative difference
   of 1.8\%, with the consequence that historically reported ozone
   concentrations should be increased by 1.8\%. In order to perform the new
   measurements of cross-sections with reduced uncertainties, a system was
   set up to generate pure ozone in the gas phase together with an optical
   system based on a UV laser with lines in the Hartley band, including
   accurate path length measurement of the absorption cell and a careful
   evaluation of possible impurities in the ozone sample by mass
   spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This resulted
   in new measurements of absolute values of ozone absorption
   cross-sections of 9.48 x 10(-18), 10.44 x 10(-18) and 11.07 x 10(-18)
   cm(2) molecule(-1), with relative expanded uncertainties better than
   0.7\%, for the wavelengths (in vacuum) of 244.06, 248.32, and 257.34 nm
   respectively. The cross-section at the 253.65 nm line of mercury was
   determined by comparisons using a Standard Reference Photometer equipped
   with a mercury lamp as the light source. The newly reported value should
   be used in the future to obtain the most accurate measurements of ozone
   concentration, which are in closer agreement with non-UV-photometry
   based methods such as the gas phase titration of ozone with nitrogen

Abstract = {We construct a two-state one-dimensional reaction-path model for ozone
   open -> cyclic isomerization dynamics. The model is based on the
   intrinsic reaction coordinate connecting the cyclic and open isomers
   with the O-2 + O asymptote on the ground-state (1)A' potential energy
   surface obtained with the high-level ab initio method. Using this
   two-state model time-dependent wave packet optimal control simulations
   are carried out. Two possible pathways are identified along with their
   respective band-limited optimal control fields; for pathway 1 the wave
   packet initially associated with the open isomer is first pumped into a
   shallow well on the excited electronic state potential curve and then
   driven back to the ground electronic state to form the cyclic isomer,
   whereas for pathway 2 the corresponding wave packet is excited directly
   to the primary well of the excited state potential curve. The
   simulations reveal that the optimal field for pathway 1 produces a final
   yield of nearly 100\% with substantially smaller intensity than that
   obtained in a previous study {[}Y. Kurosaki, M. Artamonov, T.-S. Ho, and
   H. Rabitz, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 044306 (2009)] using a single-state
   one-dimensional model. Pathway 2, due to its strong coupling to the
   dissociation channel, is less effective than pathway 1. The simulations
   also show that nonlinear field effects due to molecular polarizability
   and hyperpolarizability are small for pathway 1 but could become
   significant for pathway 2 because much higher field intensity is
   involved in the latter. The results suggest that a practical control may
   be feasible with the aid of a few lowly excited electronic states for
   ozone isomerization. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Abstract = {The kinetics and dynamics of several O + O-2 isotope exchange reactions

   This negative temperature dependence can be attributed to the absence in
   the new potential energy surface of a submerged ``reef{''} structure,

   addition, contributions of rotational excited states of the diatomic

Abstract = {Photodissociation of ozone in the near UV is studied quantum
   mechanically in two excited electronic states coupled at a conical
   intersection located outside the Franck-Condon zone. The calculations,
   performed using recent ab initio PESs, provide an accurate description
   of the photodissociation dynamics across the Hartley/Huggins absorption
   bands. The observed photofragment distributions are reproduced in the
   two electronic dissociation channels. The room temperature absorption
   spectrum, constructed as a Boltzmann average of many absorption spectra
   of rotationally excited parent ozone, agrees with experiment in terms of
   widths and intensities of diffuse structures. The exit channel conical
   intersection contributes to the coherent broadening of the absorption
   spectrum and directly affects the product vibrational and translational
   distributions. The photon energy dependences of these distributions are
   strikingly different for fragments created along the adiabatic and the
   diabatic paths through the intersection. They can be used to reverse
   engineer the most probable geometry of the non-adiabatic transition. The
   angular distributions, quantified in terms of the anisotropy parameter
   beta, are substantially different in the two channels due to a strong
   anticorrelation between beta and the rotational angular momentum of the
   fragment O-2. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

pages = {134307},
Abstract = {An accurate description of the complicated shape of the potential energy
   surface (PES) and that of the highly excited vibration states is of
   crucial importance for various unsolved issues in the spectroscopy and
   dynamics of ozone and remains a challenge for the theory. In this work a
   new analytical representation is proposed for the PES of the ground
   electronic state of the ozone molecule in the range covering the main
   potential well and the transition state towards the dissociation. This
   model accounts for particular features specific to the ozone PES for
   large variations of nuclear displacements along the minimum energy path.
   The impact of the shape of the PES near the transition state (existence
   of the ``reef structure{''}) on vibration energy levels was studied for
   the first time. The major purpose of this work was to provide accurate
   theoretical predictions for ozone vibrational band centres at the energy
   range near the dissociation threshold, which would be helpful for
   understanding the very complicated high-resolution spectra and its
   analyses currently in progress. Extended ab initio electronic structure
   calculations were carried out enabling the determination of the
   parameters of a minimum energy path PES model resulting in a new set of
   theoretical vibrational levels of ozone. A comparison with recent
   high-resolution spectroscopic data on the vibrational levels gives the
   root-mean-square deviations below 1 cm(-1) for ozone band centres up to
   90\% of the dissociation energy. New ab initio vibrational predictions
   represent a significant improvement with respect to all previously

   using two partial pressures of O-16(2)/O-18(2) mixtures. In the
   5930-6340 cm(-1) range, the four dominant bands of (OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18
   were vibrationally assigned as 2v(1)+2v(2)+3v(3)\_1, 2v(2)+5v(3),
   5v(1)+v(3) and 2v(1)+2v(2)+3v(3)\_2. They correspond to the highest
   vibration excitations observed so far in an asymmetric C-s ozone
   isotopologue. The rovibrational spectra for O-18 enriched C-s ozone
   species show specific features related to the nuclear spin statistics
   and to simultaneous symmetry allowed Coriolis and anharmonic accidental
   resonances, which are discussed. Altogether for the four new bands, 2155

Journal = OS,
Year = {2013},

Pages = {216-224},
Abstract = {We have measured and interpreted the IR spectra of liquid ozone films at
   78-85 K and ozone dissolved in liquid argon at 91-95 K. A less hindered
   rotation of ozone molecules in argon manifests itself as an intensity
   redistribution, caused by the Coriolis interaction, from the states
   nu(3)(B (1)) and nu(1) + nu(3)(B (1)) to the states nu(1)(A (1)) and 2
   nu(1)(A (1)), respectively. The occurrence of wings in the contours of
   the bands nu(1)(A (1)), 2 nu(1)(A (1)), and 2 nu(3)(A (1)) in liquid Ar
   and their absence in the spectrum of O-3 also confirms the conclusion
   that the rotational motion of ozone molecules in an inert solvent at low
   temperatures is relatively less hindered. Maxima of ozone bands in Ar
   solution are shifted toward lower frequencies compared to those in the
   gas phase by 1-30 cm(-1), which corresponds to the following shifts of
   harmonic frequencies of the molecule: Delta omega(1) = -1.85(5) cm(-1),
   Delta omega(2) = -0.67(7) cm(-1), Delta omega(3)=-7.20(5) cm(-1). It was
   found that the absorption band of the nu(3) mode in the spectrum of O-3
   in the liquid phase has a complicated asymmetric contour because of the
   resonance dipole-dipole interaction. The first and second spectral
   moments of this band have been determined to be M (1) = 1030.6 cm(-1)

Journal = {Astrobiology},

Pages = {415-438},
Abstract = {Spectral characterization of super-Earth atmospheres for planets
   orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarf stars is a key focus in
   exoplanet science. A central challenge is to understand and predict the
   expected spectral signals of atmospheric biosignatures (species
   associated with life). Our work applies a global-mean
   radiative-convective-photochemical column model assuming a planet with
   an Earth-like biomass and planetary development. We investigated planets
   with gravities of 1g and 3g and a surface pressure of 1 bar around
   central stars with spectral classes from M0 to M7. The spectral signals
   of the calculated planetary scenarios have been presented in an earlier
   work by Rauer and colleagues. The main motivation of the present work is
   to perform a deeper analysis of the chemical processes in the planetary
   atmospheres. We apply a diagnostic tool, the Pathway Analysis Program,
   to explore the photochemical pathways that form and destroy biosignature
   species. Ozone is a potential biosignature for complex life. An
   important result of our analysis is a shift in the ozone photochemistry
   from mainly Chapman production (which dominates in Earth's stratosphere)
   to smog-dominated ozone production for planets in the habitable zone of
   cooler (M5-M7)-class dwarf stars. This result is associated with a lower
   energy flux in the UVB wavelength range from the central star, hence
   slower planetary atmospheric photolysis of molecular oxygen, which slows
   the Chapman ozone production. This is important for future atmospheric
   characterization missions because it provides an indication of different
   chemical environments that can lead to very different responses of
   ozone, for example, cosmic rays. Nitrous oxide, a biosignature for
   simple bacterial life, is favored for low stratospheric UV conditions,
   that is, on planets orbiting cooler stars. Transport of this species
   from its surface source to the stratosphere where it is destroyed can
   also be a key process. Comparing 1g with 3g scenarios, our analysis
   suggests it is important to include the effects of interactive
   chemistry.},

Abstract = {Key experimental and theoretical features of mass-independent
   fractionation (MIF) of isotopes, also known as the eta-effect, are
   summarized, including its difference from the exit channel zero-point
   energy difference effect. The latter exactly cancels in the MIF. One key
   experimental result is that the MIF for O-3 formation is a low-pressure
   phenomenon and, moreover, that it decreases with increasing pressure of
   third bodies at pressures far below the ``Lindemann fall-off{''}
   pressures for three-body recombination of O and O-2. A possible origin
   of the MIF is discussed in terms of a role for isotopologue symmetry in
   intramolecular energy sharing. An explanation is suggested for the large
   difference in the fall-off pressure for recombination and the pressure
   for a large decrease in MIF, in terms of a difference between
   deactivating collisions and what we term here ``symmetry-changing
   collisions{''}. It is noted that the theory of the MIF involves four
   recombination rate constants and an equilibrium constant, for each trace
   isotope, seven rate constants in all and two equilibrium constants. A
   conceptual shortcut is noted. Experimental and computational information
   that may provide added insight into the MIF mechanism and tests is

   Levels and Absorption Cross Section}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2012},

Pages = {12260-12270},
Abstract = {By use of the 3(1)A' ab initio potential energy surface (PES) of ozone
   and the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree program for
   wavepacket propagation, we have determined numerous eigenstates of this
   state for six ozone isotopologues. These bound vibrational levels are
   the upper levels of the Huggins band, which covers the range from 27 000
   to similar to 33 000 cm(-1). This study extends our previous work on the
   Hartley band, which was limited to the range similar to 32 000-50 000
   cm(-1). Four isotopologues, O-16(3), (OOO)-O-16-O-17-O-16,
   (OOO)-O-16-O-18-O-16, and O-18(3) (noted hereafter 666, 676, 686, and
   888), are symmetric, and two are asymmetric, (OO2)-O-17-O-16 and
   (OO2)-O-18-O-16 (noted hereafter 667 and 668). The PES of the 3(1)A'
   state has two equivalent minima of C-s symmetry located at similar to 27
   000 cm(-1) above the X(1)A(1) ground state. The equilibrium geometry of
   these two minima is r(e1) = 2.28 a(0), r(e2) = 3.2 a(0), and 0, = 107
   degrees. The dissociation limit of this PES, which correlates to the
   O(D-1) + O-2 ((1)Delta) ``singlet{''} channel, is about 4300 cm(-1)
   above the two minima. For the O-16(3) isotopologue, the 120 lowest bound
   eigenstates have been calculated and partially assigned up to 800 cm(-1)
   below the dissociation limit. The 60 lower eigenstates are easily
   assignable in term of three normal modes, the ``long{''} bond (v(1)),
   the bending (v(2)), and the ``short{''} bond (v(3)). A new family of
   wave functions, aligned along the dissociation channels, appears at 3782
   cm(-1) above the 3(1)A' (0,0,0) level. The 3(1)A' vibrational levels and
   the corresponding intensity factors from the (000), (010), (100), and
   (001) levels of the X(1)A(1) ground state have been calculated for the
   six isotopologues. The Huggins absorption cross sections of the six
   isotopologues have been calculated from the 3(1)A' vibrational energy
   levels and the corresponding intensity factors. The rotational envelope
   of each vibronic band has been empirically described by an ad hoc
   function. The ratio of the Huggins cross section of each ozone
   isotopologue with one of O-16(3) provides the fractionation factor of
   each ozone isotopologue as a function of the photon energy. These
   various fractionation factors will allow predicting enrichments due to
   photolysis by various light sources like the actinic flux.},

   Symmetric and Asymmetric Isotopologues}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {12271-12279},
Abstract = {We present new calculations of the branching ratios between the various
   electronic and isotopic photodissociation channels of ozone. Special
   emphasis is placed on the isotopic/isotopologue differences because the
   contribution of the ozone photodissociation to the oxygen isotope and
   ozone isotopologue enrichments or fractionations is important for
   atmospheric applications. These branching ratios, which depend on photon
   energy, have been calculated with a full quantum mechanical wavepacket
   propagation approach: the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
   (MCTDH) method. Five ozone isotopologues are considered: three
   symmetric, O-16(3) (noted 666), (OOO)-O-16-O-17-O-16 (676), and
   (OOO)-O-16-O-18-O-16 (686); two asymmetric, (O2O)-O-16-O-17 (noted 667)
   and (O2O)-O-16-O-18 (668). The 668 and 667 asymmetric isotopologues can
   dissociate into either 66 + 8 or 68 + 6 for 668 and into 66 + 7 or 67 +
   6 for 667. In the ranges of the Chappuis and Hartley bands, the
   dissociation is very fast and electronic and isotopic branching ratios
   are obtained from the wavepacket fluxes through complex absorbing
   potentials (CAPs) located perpendicular to the dissociation channels of
   the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the A B-1(1) (Chappuis) and B
   3(1)A' (Hartley/Huggins) electronic states. In the range of the Huggins
   band the dissociation is much slower and the isotopic branching ratios
   of 667 and 668 asymmetric isotopologues, (e.g; 668 -> 66 + 8 or 86 + 6)
   are obtained from the ratios of two partial absorption cross sections
   corresponding to the selective excitation of one or the other of the two
   isomers of C-s symmetry, which dissociate respectively into 66 + 8 and
   86 + 6. We find that the photodissociation of the 668 asymmetric
   isotopologue favors the 68 + 6 channel with a propensity varying between
   52\% (Hartley) and 54\% (Huggins) as a function of the photon energy.
   The electronic branching ratios to the singlet channel (O-3 + hv ->
   O(D-1) + O-2((1)Delta)) are all close to 90\% above approximate to 32
   000 cm(-1). Below this energy, the singlet channel is energetically
   closed and only the triplet channel (O-3 + hv -> O(P-3) + O-2((3)Sigma))
   is open. These branching ratios are required to calculate the photolysis
   rates of each ozone isotopologue, which in turn contribute to the atomic
   oxygen and the ozone isotopic enrichments in the atmosphere.},

Volume = {116},
Pages = {25454-25464},
Abstract = {A modification of the energy transfer model recently proposed by two of
   us (ref 4) is tested in this work by an extensive comparison with the
   simulation results for O-3 scattering from a perfluorinated
   self-assembled monolayer (F-SAM) as well as with previous NO + FSAM and
   Ar + F-SAM scattering results. The model fits very well the trajectory
   data over a similar to 10(3)-fold of incident energies. The percentage
   of energy transferred to the surface, predicted by the model at high
   incident energies, decreases with the number of degrees of freedom of
   the projectile because they compete with the surface degrees of freedom
   as possible destinations of the incident energy. The distributions of
   the scattered ozone molecules over translational and rotational states
   show a low-energy component characterized by a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB)
   distribution at the surface temperature that survives at the highest
   collision energies. The dependence of the fraction of the MB component
   on the incident energy is an exponential decay function and the rate of
   decay is similar for the rotational and translational distributions. A
   non-negligible number of the O-3 + F-SAM trajectories that penetrate the
   surface at high energies have very long residence times (longer than the
   simulation time), which enables thermal accommodation of the rotational
   and translational degrees of freedom. A new method to categorize the O-3
   + F-SAM trajectories, based on the residence time, shows that, at very
   low incident energies (<10 kcal/mol), thermal accommodation can be
   achieved in a single collision event.},

   the first time. This allowed for completing the triad of strongly
   interacting (220), (121), and (022) states. The resonance interaction
   parameters for this triad were derived from the molecular potential
   energy surface using high-order Contact Transformation method. This
   involves Darling-Dennison resonances between (220) and (022) vibration
   A-states, and Coriolis resonances between (121) B-state and A-states.
   Altogether 18 coupling parameters were fixed to these theoretically
   predicted values that allowed avoiding problems of ambiguities while
   fitting strongly correlated parameters. The remaining small
   perturbations of a few K-a=5 transitions of the v(1) + 2v(2) + v(3) band
   were explained by accidental Coriolis resonance of (121) with the (050)
   dark state. This mixed half theoretical/half empirical model (with 39
   fitted and 77 theoretically constrained parameters) developed in this
   work for the first time allows an excellent description of 1897 line
   positions with the rms deviation similar to 0.001 cm(-1) closed to the
   experimental precision. The intensities of two new hot bands v(2) +
   4v(3) - v(3) and v(1) + v(2) + 3v(3) - v(1) that fall in this range were
   also observed and modelled, thanks to a better signal to noise ratio.
   In addition, the 5200-5600 cm(-1) region has also been revisited,
   showing for the first time the (321) state which was considered as
   ``dark{''} one in the previous analysis. Effective Hamiltonian
   parameters were derived for strongly coupled (213)/(114)/(321) upper
   states including (080) as a dark one.
   The transition moment parameters of all newly observed and assigned
   bands were derived resulting to average rms deviation for intensities of
   similar to 8\% and 13\% for the cold and the hot bands, respectively, in
   the lower range and of similar to 15\% for the bands in the upper range
   that is close to experimental accuracy for weak transitions. (C) 2012

   broadening due to the predissociation of the (3)A(2)(0 0 0) upper state
   at 9573.61 cm(-1). The width of the Lorentzian component (from 0.02 up
   to more than 0.5 cm(-1)) was retrieved for some of the assigned
   transitions. The variation of the corresponding predissociation rates is
   due to the dependence of the spin-orbit coupling between the (3)A(2)(0 0

Abstract = {In this work, we present results for dynamical (hyper)polarizabilities

   interaction (up to 50\% mixing of the wave-functions) between the (1 2

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {115},

Abstract = {The singlet triplet transformation and molecular dissociation of ozone
   (O-3) gas is investigated by performing quasi-classical molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations on an ab initio potential energy surface (PES)
   with visible and near-infrared excitations. MP4(SDQ) level of theory
   with the 6-311g(2d,2p) basis set is executed for three different
   electronic spin states (singlet, triplet, and quintet). In order to
   simplify the potential energy function, an approximation is adopted by
   ignoring the spin-orbit coupling and allowing the molecule to switch
   favorably and instantaneously to the spin state that is more
   energetically stable (lowest in energy among the three spin states).
   This assumption has previously been utilized to study the SiO2 system as
   reported by Agrawal et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124 (13), 134306). The
   use of such assumption in this study probably makes the upper limits of
   computed rate coefficients the true rate coefficients. The global PES
   for ozone is constructed by fitting 5906 ab initio data points using a
   60-neuron two-layer feed-forward neural network. The mean-absolute error
   and root-mean-squared error of this fit are 0.0446 eV (1.03 kcal/mol)
   and 0.0756 eV (1.74 kcal/mol), respectively, which reveal very good
   fitting accuracy. The parameter coefficients of the global PES are
   reported in this paper. In order to identify the spin state with high
   confidence, we propose the use of a pattern-recognition neural network,
   which is trained to predict the spin state of a given configuration
   (with a prediction accuracy being 95.6\% on a set of testing data
   points). To enhance the prediction effectiveness, a buffer series of
   five points are validated to confirm the spin state during the MD
   process to gain better confidence. Quasi-classical MD simulations from
   1.2 to 2.4 eV of total internal energy (including zero-point energy)
   result in rate coefficients of singlet triplet transformation in the
   range of 0.027 ps(-1) to 1.21 ps(-1). Also, we find very low
   dissociation probability up to 2.4 eV of internal energy during the
   investigating period (5 ps), which suggests that dissociation does not
   occur directly from the singlet ground-state, but it involves the
   excited triplet-state as an intermediate step and requires more reaction
   time to occur.},

   photodissociation anisotropy parameter beta in the singlet channel. A
   method for computing beta from trajectories computed in internal Jacobi
   coordinates is described. In the singlet channel, the vibrational
   distribution is in good agreement with the experimental results. The
   observed increase in beta with increasing photolysis wavelength is
   reproduced by the calculations and is attributed to the effects of the
   bending potential on the B state late in the fragmentation. The computed
   beta values are too high with respect to experiment, and the peaks
   j(max) of the singlet-channel rotational distributions are too low;
   these discrepancies are attributed to a too steep bending potential at
   long O-O distances. In the triplet channel, the main part of the
   internal energy distribution is described well by the calculations,
   although the detailed structures observed in the experiment are not
   reproduced. The experimental rotational distributions are well

are constructed for the lowest four states termed X, A, B, and R. In addition,
the off-diagonal potentials that couple the initially excited state B with states
R and A are constructed to reflect results from additional electronic structure
calculations, including the calculation of nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements.
The A/X and A/R couplings are also considered, although in a less ambitious manner.
The photodissociation dynamics are studied by means of trajectory surface hopping
(TSH) calculations with the branching ratio between the singlet, O(D1)+O2(Î”1g),
and triplet, O(P3)+O2(Î£3âˆ’g), channels being the main focus. The semiclassical
branching ratio agrees well with quantum mechanical results except for wavelengths
close to the threshold of the singlet channel. The calculated O(D1) quantum yield
is approximately 0.90â€“0.95 across the main part of the Hartley band, in good
agreement with experimental data. TSH calculations including all four states show
that transitions Bâ†’A are relatively unimportant and subsequent transitions Aâ†’X/R
to the triplet channel are negligible.},

Abstract = {Ozone formation in the gas phase is associated with a large and unusual

   Little is known whether similar nonstandard mass dependent
   fractionations also occur in other recombination reactions. Here we
   report on the pressure and temperature dependence of the isotopic
   composition of ozone formed by electric discharge in molecular oxygen.
   Isotope signatures at low pressures show a standard mass dependent
   depletion, their magnitudes strongly depending on temperature. Our
   analysis confirms the formation of ozone at Pyrex reactor walls with an
   atom recombination coefficient gamma = (0.4 +/- 0.1)\% at room
   temperature and slightly higher values at lower temperatures. Thus,
   although neglected so far, wall assisted ozone formation is an essential
   part of oxygen plasma chemistry and it could also provide a mechanism
   explaining the presence of ozone on icy satellites. Recombination
   reactions on the surface are not likely to show the isotope anomalies

Abstract = {The absorption cross sections of 18 isotopologues of the ozone molecule
   have been calculated in the range of the Hartley-Huggins bands
   (27000-55000 cm(-1)). All 18 possible ozone isotopologues made with
   (16)O, (17)O, and (18)O have been considered, with emphasis on those of
   geophysics interest like (16)O(3) (17)O(16)O(2), (16)O(17)O(16)O,
   (18)O(16)O(2), and (16)O(18)O(16)O. We have used the MCTDH algorithm to
   propagate wavepackets. As an initial wavepacket, we took the vibrational
   ground state multiplied by the transition dipole moment surface. The
   cross sections have been obtained from the autocorrelation function of
   this wavepacket. Only two potential energy surfaces (PESs) and the
   corresponding transition dipole moment are involved in the calculation.
   The dissociating R state has been omitted. The calculations have been
   performed only for J = 0. The comparison with the experimental
   absorption cross sections of (16)O(3) and (18)O(3) has been performed
   after an empirical smoothing which mimics the rotational envelop. The
   isotopologue dependence of the cross sections of 18 isotopologues can be
   split into two energy ranges, (a) from 27000 to 32000 cm(-1), the
   Huggins band, which is highly structured, and (b) from 32000 to 55000
   cm(-1), the main part of the cross section which has a bell shape, the
   Hartley band. This bell-shaped envelop has been characterized by a new
   analytic model depending on only four parameters, amplitude, center,
   width, and asymmetry. The isotopologue dependence of these parameters
   reveals the tiny differences between the absorption cross sections of
   the various isotopologues. In contrast to the smooth shape of the
   Hartley band, the Huggins band exhibits pronounced vibrational
   structures and therefore shows large isotopologue differences which may
   induce a significant isotopologue dependence of the ozone
   photodissociation rates under actinic flux.},

   respectively. The analysis of the whole investigated region is completed
   by the present investigation of the 6490-6900 cm (1) upper range. Three
   sets of interacting states have been treated separately. The first one
   falls in the 6490-6700 cm (1) region, where 1555 rovibrational
   transitions were assigned to three A-type bands: 3 nu(2) + 5 nu(3), 5
   nu(1) + nu(2) + nu(3) and 2 nu(1) + 3 nu(2) + 3 nu(3) and one B-type
   band: nu(1) + 3 nu(2) + 4 nu(3). The corresponding line positions were
   reproduced with an rms deviation of 18.4 x 10 (3) cm (1) by using an
   effective Hamiltonian (EH) model involving eight vibrational states
   coupled by resonance interactions. In the highest spectral region
   -6700-6900 cm (1) 389 and 183 transitions have been assigned to the
   nu(1) + 2 nu(2) + 5 nu(3) and 4 nu(1) + 3 nu(2) + nu(3) A-type bands,
   respectively. These very weak bands correspond to the most excited upper
   vibrational states observed so far in ozone. The line positions of the
   nu(1) + 2 nu(2) + 5 nu(3) band were reproduced with an rms deviation of
   7.3 x 10 (3) cm (1) by using an EH involving the \{(054), (026), (125)\}
   interacting states. The coupling of the (431) upper state with the (502)
   dark state was needed to account for the observed line positions of the
   4 nu(1) + 3 nu(2) + nu(3) band (rms = 5.7 x 10 (3) cm (1)).
   The dipole transition moment parameters were determined for the
   different observed bands. The obtained set of parameters and the
   experimentally determined energy levels were used to generate a complete

   The results of the analyses of the whole 5930-6900 cm (1) spectral

   their calculated values. The agreement achieved for both O-18(3) and
   O-16(3) (average difference on the order of 1 cm (1)) indicates that the
   used potential energy surface provides accurate predictions up to a
   vibrational excitation approaching 80\% of the dissociation energy. The
   comparison of the O-18(3) and O-16(3) band intensities is also
   discussed, opening a field of questions concerning the variation of the

   nu(2). Despite a complex spectral pattern perturbed by many
   rovibrational resonances, it has been possible to find a suitable
   effective Hamiltonian model reproducing all the transition wavenumbers
   (corresponding to 1016 energy levels) with an rms deviation of 9.5 x
   10(-3) cm(-1). A set of 721 line intensities was determined and fitted
   to derive the effective transition moment parameters. This set of
   parameters and the experimental energy levels were used to generate a
   complete line list of 2795 transitions allowing to generate synthetic
   spectrum in good agreement with the experimental spectrum. (C) 2009

Abstract = {This Letter reports reliable satellite data in the period of 1980-2007
   covering two full 11-yr cosmic ray (CR) cycles, clearly showing the
   correlation between CRs and ozone depletion, especially the polar ozone
   loss (hole) over Antarctica. The results provide strong evidence of the
   physical mechanism that the CR-driven electron-induced reaction of
   halogenated molecules plays the dominant role in causing the ozone hole.
   Moreover, this mechanism predicts one of the severest ozone losses in
   2008-2009 and probably another large hole around 2019-2020, according to
   the 11-yr CR cycle.},

Journal = ACP,
Year = {2008},

Pages = {2151-2188},
Abstract = {MIPAS, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding, is
   a mid-infrared emission spectrometer which is part of the core payload
   of ENVISAT. It is a limb sounder, i.e. it scans across the horizon
   detecting atmospheric spectral radiances which are inverted to vertical
   temperature, trace species and cloud distributions. These data can be
   used for scientific investigations in various research fields including
   dynamics and chemistry in the altitude region between upper troposphere
   and lower thermosphere.
   The instrument is a well calibrated and characterized Fourier transform
   spectrometer which is able to detect many trace constituents
   simultaneously. The different concepts of retrieval methods are
   described including multi-target and two-dimensional retrievals.
   Operationally generated data sets consist of temperature, H2O, O-3, CH4,
   N2O, HNO3, and NO2 profiles. Measurement errors are investigated in
   detail and random and systematic errors are specified. The results are
   validated by independent instrumentation which has been operated at
   ground stations or aboard balloon gondolas and aircraft.
   Intercomparisons of MIPAS measurements with other satellite data have
   been carried out, too. As a result, it has been proven that the MIPAS
   data are of good quality.
   MIPAS can be operated in different measurement modes in order to
   optimize the scientific output. Due to the wealth of information in the
   MIPAS spectra, many scientific results have already been published. They
   include intercomparisons of temperature distributions with ECMWF data,
   the derivation of the whole NOy family, the study of atmospheric
   processes during the Antarctic vortex split in September 2002, the
   determination of properties of Polar Stratospheric Clouds, the downward
   transport of NOx in the middle atmosphere, the stratosphere-troposphere
   exchange, the influence of solar variability on the middle atmosphere,
   and the observation of Non-LTE effects in the mesosphere.},

Abstract = {The photoabsorption spectrum of ozone in the UV range (5-9 eV) is
   calculated from a short-time wave packet propagation using six potential
   energy surfaces obtained from ab initio electronic structure
   calculations. It is shown that the (unnamed) band around 7 eV, which is
   immediately adjacent to the intense Hartley band, is primarily due to
   excitation of three electronic states: 5 (1)A' (3 (1)A(t)), 6 (1)A' (4
   (1)A(1)), and 4 (1)A{''} (2 (1)B(1)). Excitation of the state 8 (1)A'
   ((1)B(2)) leads to a broad and intense band starting around 8 eV with a
   maximum near 9.1 eV. In full accord with the recent experimental study
   of Brouard et al. {[}M. Brouard, R. Cireasa, A.P. Clark, G.C.

   (6.42 eV) involves at least two states (5 (1)A' and 4 (1)A{''})
   different from the state excited in the Hartley band (3 W). The dynamics
   along the dissociation path is discussed in terms of one-dimensional
   potential curves. Several avoided crossings among the excited (1)A' as
   well as the (1)A{''} states point to a complicated fragmentation
   process. Although a quantitative analysis of branching ratios is not

Year = {2008},
Volume = {41},
pages = {085104},
Abstract = {The opportunity of detecting vibrationally excited ozone molecules using
   UV absorption spectroscopy in the Hartley band was studied. The proposed
   approach is based on comparing the experimentally measured absorption
   spectrum with the simulated one. For this purpose the absorption spectra
   for 35 lower vibrational states ((1)A(1), v(1)v(2)v(3)) in the Hartley
   band were simulated from ab initio calculations of O(3)
   photodissociation dynamics by the method of pseudo-coherent states
   (PCS). A comparison between this method and the known so-called `frozen'
   Gaussians (FGA) method was carried out. The limitations of the
   applicability and accuracy for both methods were considered. The
   calculation results also were compared with available data of
   experiments and stricter ab initio calculations. It was shown that
   despite its approximate character the calculation method used in this
   paper provides a very sufficient accuracy in calculating correctly the
   absorption spectrum `envelope' for all the lower vibrational states of
   O(3). Furthermore the given approach was applied in detecting O(3)(vib)
   in the plasma of a glow dc discharge in pure O(2). The analysis of the
   experimental data on absorption spectra and density distributions of

Abstract = {Weak vibrational bands of (16)O(3) could be detected in the 5850-7030

   equivalent absorption alpha(min) similar to 3 x 10(-10) cm(-1)), bands
   reaching a total of 16 upper vibrational states have been previously
   reported in selected spectral regions. In the present report, the
   analysis of the whole investigated region is completed by new recordings
   in three spectral regions which have allowed: (i) a refined analysis of
   the n(1) + 3n(2) + 3n(3) band from new spectra in the 5850 - 5900 cm(-1)
   region; (ii) an important extension of the assignments of the 2n(1) +
   5n(3) and 4n(1) + 2n(2) + n(3) bands in the 6500 - 6600 cm(-1) region,
   previously recorded by frequency modulation diode laser spectroscopy.
   The rovibrational assignments of the weak 4n(1) + 2n(2) + n(3) band were
   fully confirmed by the new observation of the 4n(1) + 2n(2) + n(3) -
   n(2) hot band near 5866.9 cm(-1) reaching the same upper state; (iii)
   the observation and modelling of three A-type bands at 6895.51, 6981.87
   and 6990.07 cm(-1) corresponding to the highest excited vibrational
   bands of ozone detected so far at high resolution. The upper vibrational
   states were assigned by comparison of their energy values with
   calculated values obtained from the ground state potential energy
   surface of (16)O(3). The vibrational mixing and consequently the
   ambiguities in the vibrational labelling are discussed. For each band or
   set of interacting bands, the spectroscopic parameters were determined
   from a fit of the corresponding line positions in the frame of the
   effective Hamiltonian ( EH) model. A set of selected absolute line
   intensities was measured and used to derive the parameters of the
   effective transition moment operator. The exhaustive review of the
   previous observations gathered with the present results is presented and
   discussed. It leads to a total number of 3863 energy levels belonging to
   21 vibrational states and corresponding to 7315 transitions. In the
   considered spectral region corresponding to up to 82\% of the
   dissociation energy, the increasing importance of the ``dark'' states is
   illustrated by the occurrence of frequent rovibrational perturbations
   and the observation of many weak lines still unassigned.},

   the assignment of the major pathway to curve crossing from the B to the
   repulsive R surface, generating fast fragments in a wide range of
   vibrational states. For the slow fragments, it is proposed that
   following excitation to the B state, the system crosses onto the A
   state. The crossing seam is only accessible to molecules that are highly
   vibrationally excited and therefore possess modest recoil speeds. Once
   on the A state, the wavepacket is thought to funnel through a conical
   intersection to the ground state. The velocity distributions, spatial

   lend support to this mechanism. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

   dependence of enrichments, the agreement is good. While the initial

   made for isotope effects on ratios of rate constants in other reactions

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {126},
pages = {244305},
Abstract = {In this paper the authors use the optimal internal vibrational
   coordinates previously determined for the electronic ground state of the
   ozone molecule to study the vibrational spectrum of the molecule
   employing the second empirical potential energy surface calculated by
   Tyuterev {[}Chem. Phys. Lett. 316, 271 (2000)]. First, the authors
   compute variationally all the bound vibrational energy levels of the
   molecule up to the dissociation limit and state the usefulness of the
   optimal coordinates in this respect, which allows us to converge all the
   bound levels using relatively small anharmonic basis sets. By analyzing
   the expansion coefficients of the wave functions, they show then that a
   large portion of the vibrational spectrum of O-3 can be structured in
   nearly separable polyadic groups characterized by the polyad quantum
   number N=n(1)+n(2)+n(theta) corresponding to the optimal internal
   coordinates. Accordingly, they determine an internal effective
   vibrational Hamiltonian for O-3 by fitting the effective Hamiltonian
   parameters to the experimental vibrational frequencies, using as input
   parameters in the fit those extracted from an analytical second-order
   Van Vleck perturbation theory calculation. It is finally shown that the
   internal effective Hamiltonian thus obtained accurately describes the
   vibrational spectrum of ozone in the low and medium energy regimes. (c)

Abstract = {The absorption spectrum of ozone, O-16(3), has been recorded by
   CW-cavity ring down spectroscopy in the 6625-6830 cm(-1) region. The
   typical sensitivity of these recordings (alpha(min) similar to 3 x
   10(-10) cm(-1)) allows observing very weak transitions with intensity
   down to 2 x 10(-28) cm/molecule. 483 and 299 transitions have been
   assigned to the 2 nu(1) + 3 nu(2) + 3 nu(3) A-type band and to the 2v(1)
   + 4v(2) + 2 nu(3) B-type band, respectively, which are the highest
   frequency bands of ozone recorded so far under high resolution.
   Rovibrational transitions with J and K-a values up to 46 and 12,
   respectively, could be assigned. Despite well-known difficulties to
   correctly reproduce the energy levels not far from the dissociation
   limit, it was possible to determine the parameters of an effective
   Hamiltonian which includes six vibrational states, four of them being
   dark states. The line positions analysis led to an rms deviation of 8.5
   x 10(-3) cm(-1) while the experimental line intensities could be
   satisfactorily reproduced. Additional experiments in the 5970-6021
   cm(-1) region allows detecting tile (233) <- (010) hot band reaching the
   same upper state as the preceding cold band. From the effective
   parameters of the (233) state just determined and those of the (010)

   used for a further refinement of the rovibrational parameters of the
   effective Hamiltonian leading to a value of 7.6 x 10(-3) cm(-1) for the
   global rms deviation. The complete list of the experimentally determined
   rovibrational energy levels of the (233), (242), and (520) states is

Abstract = {Observations of ozone on Mars were made using the Goddard Space Flight

   Ozone is an important observable tracer of martian photochemistry.
   Infrared heterodyne spectroscopy with spectral resolution >= 10(6) is
   the only technique that directly measures ozone in the martian
   atmosphere from the surface of the Earth. Ozone column abundances down
   to the martian surface were acquired in seven data sets taken between
   1988 and 2003 at various orbital positions (LS = 40 degrees, 74 degrees,
   102 degrees, 115 degrees, 202 degrees, 208 degrees, 291 degrees). Ozone
   abundances are compared with those retrieved using ultraviolet
   techniques, showing good agreement. Odd hydrogen (HOX) chemistry
   predicts anticorrelation of ozone and water vapor abundances. Retrieved
   ozone abundances consistently show anticorrelation with corresponding
   water vapor abundances. providing strong confirmation of odd hydrogen
   activity. Deviation front strict anticorrelation between the observed
   total column densities of ozone and water vapor suggests that
   constituent vertical distribution is an additional, significant factor.

Abstract = {We present a kinetic calculation for the isotopic composition of
   stratospheric ozone. The calculated enrichments of O-49(3) and O-50(3)
   are in agreement with atmospheric measurements made at midlatitudes.
   Integrating the kinetic fractionation processes in the formation and
   photolysis of ozone, we obtain enrichments of similar to 7.5-10.5 and
   similar to 7.5-12.5\% (referenced to atmospheric O-2) for delta O-49(3)
   and delta O-50(3), respectively, at altitudes between 20 and 35 km; the
   photolysis in the Hartley band of ozone is responsible for the observed
   altitude variation. The overall magnitude of the ozone enrichments
   (similar to 10\%) is large compared with that commonly known in
   atmospheric chemistry and geochemistry. The heavy oxygen atom in ozone
   is therefore useful as a tracer of chemical species and pathways that
   involve ozone or its derived products. For example, the mass anomalies
   of oxygen in two greenhouse gases, CO2 and N2O, are likely the
   consequences of the transfer of heavy oxygen atoms from ozone.},

Abstract = {The formation of ozone (O-3) in neat oxygen ices was investigated

   was irradiated with energetic electrons; the chemical modification of
   the target was followed on-line and in situ via Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; solid state) and quadrupole mass
   spectrometry (QMS; gas phase). The dominant product identified was the
   ozone molecule in the bent, C-2v symmetric structure, O-3(X(1)A(1)); the
   cyclic D-3h isomer was not observed. The associated van der Waals
   complexes {[}O-3...O] and {[}O-3...O-3] could also be detected via
   infrared spectroscopy, verifying explicitly the existence of oxygen
   atoms in the matrix at 11 K. Three different formation mechanisms of
   ozone were revealed. Two pathways involve the reaction of suprathermal
   oxygen atoms with molecular oxygen {[}O-2(X-3 Sigma(-)(g))] at 11 K.
   Once the sample was warmed after the irradiation to about 38 K, a third,
   thermal reaction pathway involving the barrierless reaction of
   ground-state oxygen atoms with molecular oxygen sets in. During the
   warm-up phase, the inherent sublimation of oxygen and ozone was
   monitored by mass spectrometry and occurs in the ranges 28-43 and 58-73
   K, respectively. Our data are of help to understand the mechanisms of
   ozone formation within apolar interstellar and cometary ices and could
   also be applicable to outer solar system icy bodies, such as the moons

Abstract = {Ab initio potential energy and transition dipole moment surfaces are
   presented for the five lowest singlet even symmetry electronic states of
   ozone. The surfaces are calculated using the complete active space self
   consistent field method followed by contracted multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations. A slightly reduced
   augmented correlation consistent valence triple-zeta orbital basis set
   is used. The ground and excited state energies of the molecule have been
   computed at 9282 separate nuclear geometries. Cuts through the potential
   energy surfaces, which pass through the geometry of the minimum of the
   ground electronic state, show several closely avoided crossings. Close
   examination, and higher level calculations, very strongly suggests that
   some of these seemingly avoided crossings are in fact associated with
   non-symmetry related conical intersections. Diabatic potential energy
   and transition dipole moment surfaces are created from the computed ab
   initio adiabatic MRCI energies and transition dipole moments. The
   transition dipole moment connecting the ground electronic state to the
   diabatic (B) over bar state surface is by far the strongest.
   Vibrational-rotational wavefunctions and energies are computed using the
   ground electronic state. The energy level separations compare well with
   experimentally determined values. The ground vibrational state
   wavefunction is then used, together with the diabatic (B) over bar <- X

Abstract = {The ``hot bands{''} of the Huggins band of ozone are assigned, in both

   calculated with three-dimensional vibrational wave functions for the

   structures in the 218 K spectrum all can be assigned to transitions
   starting from vibrational states with one quantum of stretching
   excitation in the ground electronic state. The 295 K spectrum shows new
   structures, which are due to transitions originating from vibrational
   states in the X state with two quanta of excitation of the stretching
   modes-despite very small Boltzmann factors. All structures in the
   low-energy range of the 295 K spectrum, even the very weak ones, thus
   can be uniquely interpreted. The significance of hot bands results from
   the strong increase of Franck-Condon factors with excitation of the

   electrons frozen in doubly occupied molecular orbitals 1a(1), 2a(1), and

   This CI model gave an adequate description of the vertical spectrum of
   these excited states which span the energy range 0-10 eV and also gave a
   good representation of the charge cloud of the ground state at its
   equilibrium geometry which provided a dipole moment of 0.61 D in good

Abstract = {The data bases for low- pressure rate coefficients of the dissociation
   of O-3 and the reverse recombination of O with O-2 in the bath gases M =

   transfer ( ET) mechanism. On condition that this holds for Ar and N-2
   near 800 K, average energies transferred per collision of - <Delta E
   >/hc = 18 and 25 cm(-1) are derived, respectively. Assuming an only weak
   temperature dependence of <Delta E > as known in similar systems, rate
   coefficients for the ET-mechanism are extrapolated to lower temperatures
   and compared with the experiments. The difference between measured and
   extrapolated rate coefficients is attributed to the radical complex (RC)
   mechanism. The derived rate coefficients for the RC-mechanism are
   rationalized in terms of equilibrium constants for equilibria of van der
   Waals complexes of O (or O-2) with the bath gases and with rate
   coefficients for oxygen abstraction from these complexes. The latter are
   of similar magnitude as rate coefficients for oxygen isotope exchange

Journal = SCAA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {2867-2885},
Abstract = {We demonstrate how relative equilibria of a vibrating molecule, which
   are families of principal periodic orbits otherwise known as nonlinear
   normal modes, can be used to describe the global polyad structure of
   vibrational energy levels. The classical action integral n(E) computed
   along these orbits at different energies E corresponds to the polyad
   quantum number n so that the energy E(n) of different relative
   equilibria describes the splitting of n-polyads. Further information on
   the internal polyad structure can be driven from the stability analysis
   of relative equilibria. We use the ozone molecule as a concrete example
   where n-polyads or ``hyperpolyads{''} should be distinguished from the
   well-known polyads of the 1:1 stretching mode resonance; the stretching
   polyads are structural elements of hyperpolyads. We give dynamical
   interpretation of the relation between relative equilibria and n-polyads
   based on the normal form reduction in the limit of small vibrations near
   the equilibrium. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Coupled one-dimensional photochemical-climate calculations have been
   performed for hypothetical Earth-like planets around M dwarfs.
   Visible/near-infrared and thermal-infrared synthetic spectra of these
   planets were generated to determine which biosignature gases might be
   observed by a future, space-based telescope. Our star sample included
   two observed active M dwarfs-AD Leo and GJ 643-and three quiescent model
   stars. The spectral distribution of these stars in the ultraviolet
   generates a different photochemistry on these planets. As a result, the
   biogenic gases CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl have substantially longer lifetimes
   and higher mixing ratios than on Earth, making them potentially
   observable by space-based telescopes. On the active M-star planets, an
   ozone layer similar to Earth's was developed that resulted in a
   spectroscopic signature comparable to the terrestrial one. The
   simultaneous detection of O-2 (or O-3) and a reduced gas in a planet's
   atmosphere has been suggested as strong evidence for life. Planets
   circling M stars may be good locations to search for such evidence.},

Abstract = {In order to investigate the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS)
   region of the earth's atmosphere, ESA/ESTEC (European space agency) is
   considering the opportunity to develop the spaceborne limb sounding
   millimeter sensor ``MASTER{''} (millimeter wave acquisitions for

   the ``MARSCHALS{''} (millimeter-wave airborne receiver for spectroscopic
   characterization of atmospheric limb sounding) airborne instrument which

   the line-by-line database which was generated in order to meet at best

   parameters in the 294-305, 316-325, 342-348, 497-506 and 624-626 GHz

   HCN, H2O2, COF2, HO2 and HOBr) had also to be considered in the database
   as ``possible interfering species{''} for the retrieval of the target

Abstract = {{[}1] The ratio of asymmetric vs. symmetric molecules of heavy ozone,
   r(50) = {[}(OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18]/ {[}(OOO)-O-16-O-18-O-16], or similarly
   r(49) for O-17-containing ozone, is an essential feature of the unusual
   oxygen isotope effect in ozone formation. Whereas information on r(49)
   is sparse and of limited accuracy, precision in laboratory measurements
   of r(50) has recently been improved. The two most recent experiments,
   however, disagree on whether there is a preference for the formation of
   asymmetric over symmetric molecules or not (r(50) > 2 versus r50 = 2).
   To throw light on this discrepancy, the temperature dependence of r(50)
   has been derived from a reanalysis of existing measurements: r(50) is
   found to decrease from 2.13 at 360 K to about 2.00 at 170 K. Kinetic
   model calculations show that the discrepancy between the two
   measurements disappears when temperature conditions for ozone formation
   are accounted for. The reanalysis confirms that the isotope enrichment
   in atmospheric (O2O)-O-16-O-18 predominantly but not exclusively resides
   in the asymmetric molecule, with the preference for asymmetric molecules
   becoming smaller at low-temperature conditions. The enrichment E-50(a)
   of (OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18 which likely characterizes the source strength
   of ozone to transfer heavy oxygen (O-18) into other atmospheric
   molecules is quantified as a function of temperature and in relation to
   the overall enrichment of heavy ozone. This information can now be used
   in atmospheric models that simulate isotope transfer effects.},

Abstract = {We report direct absorption spectroscopic detection of ozone at ambient
   pressure with a pulsed, DFB quantum-cascade laser (QCL) tuned within
   1044-1050 cm(-1) by temperature scanning. Wavelength calibration curves
   were derived from FTIR and CO2 spectra and interpreted with respect to
   the heat transfer from the heterostructure to the sink. The laser
   linewidth (similar to0.13 cm(-1) FWHM) was found to decrease with
   temperature, probably as a result of operation at constant current.
   Spurious spectral features due to baseline inaccuracies were
   successfully filtered out from the QCL O-3 spectra using differential
   absorption. Reference O-3 concentrations were obtained by applying the
   same method to UV spectra, simultaneously measured with a differential
   optical absorption spectrometer (DOAS). Column densities retrieved from
   QCL spectra are in fairly good agreement (+/-20\%) with the DOAS values
   above 28 ppm m. The estimated QCL lowest detectable, absolute and
   differential absorptions, (7x10(-3) and 2x10(-3), respectively), entail
   effective detection limits of 14 and 25 ppm m, respectively. Ongoing
   improvements in the acquisition system should allow the achievement of
   detection limits at the level of commercial open-path DOAS systems
   (similar to2 ppm m) in the near future. Our results demonstrate the
   applicability of the differential absorption method to QCL spectroscopy
   at ambient pressure, and encourage its use for open path detection.},

Abstract = {First-principles calculations of absolute line intensities and
   rovibrational energies of ozone (O-16(3)) are reported using potential
   energy and electric dipole moment functions calculated by the internally
   contracted MRCI approach. The rovibrational energies and eigenfunctions
   (up to about 8500 cm(-1) and J = 64) were obtained variationally with an
   exact Hamiltonian in internal valence coordinates. More than 4.8 x 10(6)
   electric dipole transition matrix elements were calculated for the
   absolute rovibrational line intensities. They are compared with the
   values of the HITRAN database. The purely rotational absolute line
   intensities in the (000) state and the rovibrational intensities for the
   (001)-(000) band agree to within about 0.3 to 1\% for the (0 10)-(000)
   band to within about 3 to 4\%. Excellent agreement with experiment is
   also achieved for low-lying overtone and combination bands.
   Inconsistencies are found for the (100)-(000) band overlapping with the
   antisymmetric stretching fundamental and also for the (002)-(000)
   antisymmetric stretching overtone. The generated dipole moment function
   can be used for predicting the absorption intensities in any of the
   heavier isotopomers, hot bands or the rates of spontaneous emission.},

   preliminary analysis of the rotational Structure of the absorption

   corresponds to a Superposition of two different electronic transitions,
   one with a very broad rotational Structure, showing, for the first time
   the asymmetric stretching frequency mode v(3) of the electronic state

Abstract = {The effect of spin-orbit coupling on O(P-3)+O-2((3)Sigma(g)(-))

   The probability of forming O-3 complexes, which is important for
   understanding the atom exchange reaction mechanism, is calculated in two
   different ways. The first approach follows the standard treatment in
   that only the reactive ground electronic state is included. In the
   second approach all 27 states correlating with
   O(P-3)+O-2((3)Sigma(g)(-)) and the nonadiabatic transitions induced by
   spin-orbit coupling are taken into account; all the excited electronic
   states are repulsive and thus do not lead to complex formation if
   nonadiabatic transitions are neglected. The required nine diabatic
   potential energy surfaces (not including spin-orbit coupling) for the
   electronic states 1 (s)A', 2 (s)A', and (s)A{''} (s=1, 3, and 5) are
   constructed by high-level electronic structure calculations in the
   asymptotic O+O-2 channel with the O-2 bond length being fixed. The two
   sets of calculations show that spin-orbit coupling is not an important
   effect. The probability for forming ozone complexes when the oxygen atom
   is initially in the excited fine structure state O(P-3(j=1)) state is
   only 10\% of that for the lowest state O(P-3(j=2)), and it is below 1\%
   for O(P-3(j=0)). The single-surface calculation, with the excited states
   phenomenologically taken into account by a statistical factor, gives a
   rather accurate value for the thermally averaged complex formation rate

Abstract = {Determination of electronic structure of ozone related geometry is the

   satisfy the experimental geometry, explain the excellent oxidizing
   properties of ozone, and can also explain the capability of additional
   reaction with unsaturated hydrocarbons. The potential energy surface of
   singlet and triplet state of ozone has been studied in order to check
   the correctness of the proposed structure. The proposed electronic
   structure of ozone is capable of explaining the oxidizing behavior of
   ozone in visible wavelength (daylight) 430-700 nm. For comparison, the
   other proposed structure of ozone in literature such as Pauling, Linnett
   and Weinhold has also been discussed. The main method used in this
   research is well-known density functional procedure, B3LYP, which takes
   the electron correlation aspect into consideration. The polarization and
   diffused functions are included in the basis set, 6-311++G{*}{*}. The

of the ozone absorption from a sealed gas cell are measured with a FTIR to determine
the amount of ozone in the cell. The satellite instrument then views the cell

demonstrate that the method works successfully. Spectral measurements of the ozone
absorption from a gas cell were measured with an FTIR spectrometer to determine
the amount of ozone in the cell and then used to test the performance of the
OSIRIS-DM spectrograph. The ozone spectra of the Huggins and Chappuis bands that
were derived from the OSIRIS measurements were found to be in good agreement with
the simulated spectra of known amounts of ozone from a radiative transfer model.
The measurements reported here were taken for the purpose of characterising the
performance of the OSIRIS instrument at Ottawa before flight. Final measurements
were also taken at Toulouse before flight in August 2000 for the purpose of calibrating
the OSIRIS FM instrument. It is recommended that all future satellite instruments
for measuring ozone be calibrated pre-flight using this or a similar technique.
It is also recommended that all ground based ozone-monitoring instruments such as
Brewer or Dobson spectrophotometers to be used for validation of satellite instruments
be calibrated using this portable and inexpensive technique.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {7603-7613},
Abstract = {The isotope exchange reaction, and the three-body ozone formation rate
   proceeding through an ozone complex, have been studied by classical and
   quasi-classical trajectory techniques. The exchange rate studies
   indicate that the rate of this reaction is dominantly sensitive to the
   O+O-2 entrance channel characteristics of the potential energy surface.
   A detailed consideration of the dynamics of the intermediate ozone
   complex reveals three important classes. In one class, the complex
   adopts an ozonelike geometry, largely undergoing asymmetric
   stretchinglike motion until it dissociates. In a second class, the
   oxygen atom and molecule never visit the ozonelike geometry but rather
   remain separated by relatively large distances trapped near the angular
   momentum barrier in the entrance channel of a pseudo-effective
   potential. These complexes, which cannot undergo exchange, are,
   nevertheless, found to contribute significantly to ozone formation at
   high density of the third body suggesting that the association of the
   high-density effective formation rate constant with twice the exchange
   rate may not be valid. The third class can be considered a hybrid of the
   first two, spending some time as an ozonelike complex and some time as a
   large atom-diatomic complex. This third class provides a mechanism for
   rearranging atom locations in the complex (e.g., end and middle position
   swapping) and, consequently, would not be well accounted for by
   statistical treatments of the ozone complex based on a single ozonelike
   reference geometry. In general, the survival time distributions of the
   complexes are found to be nonexponential. However, when the detailed
   survival time distributions are coupled with a Lennard-Jones collision
   model for the stabilization step, the experimental ozone formation rate
   can be adequately modeled over a broad range of temperature and density.

Abstract = {The strange mass-independent isotope effect for the enrichment of ozone
   and the contrastingly unconventional strong mass-dependent effect of
   individual reaction rate constants are studied using statistical
   (RRKM)-based theory with a hindered-rotor transition state. Individual
   rate constant ratios of recombination reactions and enrichments are
   calculated. The theory assumes (1) an ``eta -effect,{''} which can be
   interpreted as a small deviation from the statistical density of states
   for symmetric isotopomers, compared with the asymmetric isotopomers, and
   (2) weak collisions for deactivation of the vibrationally excited ozone
   molecules. A partitioning effect controls the recombination rate
   constant ratios. It arises from small differences in zero-point energies
   of the two exit channels of dissociation of an asymmetric ozone
   isotopomer, which are magnified into large differences in numbers of
   states in the two competing exit channel transition states. In
   enrichment experiments, in contrast, this partitioning factor disappears
   exactly {[}Hathorn and Marcus, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 9497 (2000)], and
   what remains is the eta -effect. Both aspects can be regarded as
   ``symmetry driven{''} isotopic effects. The two experiments, enrichments
   and rate constant ratios, thus reveal markedly different theoretical
   aspects of the phenomena. The calculated low-pressure ozone enrichments,
   the low-pressure recombination rate constant ratios, the effects of
   pressure on the enrichment, on the individual recombination rate
   constant ratios, and on the recombination rate constant are consistent
   with the experimental data. The temperature dependence of the enrichment
   and of the recombination rate constant ratios is discussed and a variety
   of experimental tests are proposed. The negative temperature dependence
   of the isotopic exchange rate constant for the reaction
   O-16+(OO)-O-18-O-18 --> (OO)-O-16-O-18+O-18 at 130 K and 300 K is used

Abstract = {We present an ab initio potential energy surface for the ground

   identical C-2v (open) minima, the D-3h (ring) minimum, as well as the
   O(P-3)+O-2((3)Sigma(g)(-)) dissociation threshold. The electronic
   structure calculations are performed at the multireference configuration
   interaction level with complete active space self-consistent-field
   reference functions and correlation consistent polarized quadruple zeta
   atomic basis functions. Two of the O-O bond distances, R-1 and R-2, and
   the O-O-O bending angle are varied on a regular grid (ca. 5000 points
   with R(1)greater than or equal toR(2)). An analytical representation is
   obtained by a three-dimensional cubic spline. The calculated potential
   energy surface has a tiny dissociation barrier and a shallow van der
   Waals minimum in the exit channel. The ring minimum is separated from
   the three open minima by a high potential barrier and therefore
   presumably does not influence the low-temperature kinetics. The
   dissociation energy is reproduced up to 90\% of the experimental value.
   All bound states of nonrotating ozone up to more than 99\% of the

   root-mean-square error for all measured transition energies for O-16(3)

Year = {2002},

Abstract = {A new set of spectroscopic constants of the O-16(3) molecule (omega(i),
   x(ij), y(ijk), gamma(DD), alpha(i)(x), beta(ij)(x),...), which determine
   vibrational dependence of band centres and rotational parameters, is
   derived from recent accurate analysis of high-resolution experimental
   ro-vibrational spectra through the theoretical approach based on
   secon\&order perturbation expansions in normal coordinates accounting
   for Darling-Dennison resonance interactions. These values are used to
   update empirical values of anharmonic coefficients (k(ijl), k(ijlm)) of
   the potential function expansion in normal coordinates. Quadratic f(rr),
   f(ralpha), f(rr'), f(alphaalpha) as well as cubic f(rst) and quartic
   f(rstl) force constants in internal (bond lengths, bond angle)
   coordinates are also derived. A detailed discussion is devoted to the
   accuracy of parameter determination for each of four steps of
   calculations. It is emphasised that the conventional method based on the
   inversion of formulae of the perturbation theory gives the largest
   uncertainties at the last step of calculations: the determination of the
   anharmonic force field in internal coordinates. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   3nu(3), 2nu(1)+nu(3),nu(2)+3nu(3), nu(1)+nu(2)+3nu(3), and 5nu(3). The
   analysis of these bands has been per-formed using effective
   rovibrational Hamiltonians for 10 polyads of interacting upper
   vibrational states. To correctly reproduce all observed transitions, it

Journal = MP,
Year = {2002},
Volume = {100},
Pages = {3601-3614},
Abstract = {A number of valence and Rydberg, singlet and triplet excited states for
   ozone in the excitation energy range 1-12 eV have been calculated by
   large scale CI methods preceded by MCSCF studies. A comparison of the
   theoretical intensity envelope with the VUV+ EELS spectrum has been
   made. The present work supports the assignments for the Huggins(+)
   Hartley bands as having two electronic origins, 2(1)A(1) and 1(1)B(2).
   The experimental 1 9: 3 eV and 1 10: 2 eV bands of the VUV spectrum must
   have adventitious superposition of valence states on Rydberg
   transitions, because the high oscillator strengths of the valence states
   cannot be attributed to the 8.8 eV broad band. A number of new valence
   and Rydberg states have been calculated, and these lead to the
   conclusion that the experimental 9-11 eV VUV spectral range in
   particular must yield more experimental states than the few so far
   identified. This suggests a major need for more sophisticated methods of
   experimental study for the excited state manifolds. The use of various
   MCSCF/CI studies of the vertical cationic states, supports the IP order
   as (2) A(1) < B-2(2) < (2)A(2). A re-analysis of the 12-13.4 eV range of
   the UV-photoelectron band has been performed, with a view to determining
   the adiabatic IPs more accurately. The present work suggests that the
   adiabatic IP2 lies at 12.86 eV, slightly lower than has been assumed,

Abstract = {The localized molecular orbital theory and energy partitioning formalism

   The range of investigation covers a large number of conformations
   generated theoretically over the wide range of apical angles between
   angular (C-2v) to linear (D-infinityh) shapes. The results demonstrate
   that, similar to the bonding in diborane, there are two equivalent
   three-centered bonds in ozone embracing three oxygen atoms in all the
   conformations. The possibility of a triangular structure of ozone is
   ruled out because the computed localized molecular orbitals demonstrate
   that there is no bonding between the terminal oxygen atoms and the
   decomposed energy components show-that the interaction between terminal
   oxygen atoms is strongly repulsive. Charge density distribution is
   asymmetric in the homonuclear molecule and its dipole moment is an
   algebraic sum of bond moment and lone pair moment and lone pair on the
   apical oxygen atom contributes significantly to the dipole moment. It is
   demonstrated that any attempt of calculating the apical angle from the
   experimentally determined dipole moment would be erroneous and
   misleading. Variation of dipole moment as a function of angular to
   linear reorganization of molecular shape is correlated in terms of
   computed quantum mechanical hybridization of the lone pair on the apical

   absorption spectrum of O-3 is presented in which the structure in both
   bands is assigned to vibrational progressions in the symmetric
   stretching mode nu (1) and the bending mode nu (2) but not the
   asymmetric stretching mode nu (3). The present improved fit of a larger
   range of bands results in relatively large anharmonicity terms, whereas
   previous assignments have relied on the motion being largely harmonic in
   the upper state. From a consideration of the shape of single surface
   required to support both sets of vibrational data, it is concluded that
   the Huggins bands almost certainly terminate on the 2 (1)A(1) state
   rather than the 1 B-1(2) state. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {A high resolution Fourier transform spectrometry analysis of the
   rotational structure of the 2(0)(1) absorption bands of the (3)A(2) <--
   (X) over tilde (1)A(1) Wulf transition for the isotopomers O-16(3) and
   O-18(3) of the ozone molecule is presented. These bands are very intense
   compared to the 0(0)(0) bands but the predissociation is so strong that
   the main sub-bands appear as continuous contours. Isolated lines and
   band contour methods are used together to analyse these two
   rovibrational bands. The lines corresponding to the F-2 component are
   generally the most intense and isolated. Our data sets for the (0 1 0)
   level of the (3)A(2) state are limited to about 102 weakly or
   unperturbed rotational lines for the 2(0)(1) of O-16(3) in the range
   9620-10 140 cm(-1) and 123 weakly or unperturbed rotational lines for
   the same band of O-18(3). Using for each of them the well-defined ground
   state parameters, we obtained a standard deviation of about 0.035 cm(-1)
   in the fit to the lines for O-16(3) and 0.027 cm(-1) in the case of
   O-18(3). The rotational constants A, B and C, the three rotational
   distortion terms Delta (K), Delta (JK), and Delta (J), the spin-rotation
   constants a(0), a and b have been successfully calculated for O-16(3)
   and O-18(3) while the spin-spin constants were fixed to their respective
   values obtained for the origin bands. As is the case for the 0(0)(0)
   band, we have a partial agreement with the isotopic laws for the
   rotational constants. The geometrical parameters of the (0 1 0) level of
   (3)A(2) State for the two isotopomers are close, r = 1.357 Angstrom,
   theta = 100.7 degrees for O-18(3) and r = 1.352 Angstrom and theta =
   100.0 degrees for O-16(3). The origin of the 2(0)(1) band of O-18(3) is
   red shifted by 7.06(4) cm(-1) with respect to O-16(3) 2(0)(1) band and
   the two bending mode quanta are, respectively, 528.99(9) and 501.34(7)
   cm(-1) A preliminary qualitative analysis of the predissociation is
   given in the particular case of the F-2 spin component of O-16(3) for
   0(0)(0) and 24 bands by the measurement of shifts of positions of some
   rovibrational levels and the evolution of predissociation broadenings in
   (Q)Q2 branches. We justify the existence of perturbations in the
   rovibrational levels of (3)A(2) state through different interaction
   types: with the dissociation continuum of the same electronic state or
   with high vibrational repulsive or weakly bound levels of the ground
   state. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {{Spin-orbit coupling effects in ozone depletion spectroscopy}},
Journal = {Bull. Pol. Acad. Sci.-Chem.},
Year = {2001},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {133-164},
Abstract = {The structure of halogen oxides, XO (X = Cl, Br, I), stability of their
   anions and the UV-visible absorption spectra of hypohalous acids, HOX,
   are studied by ab initio methods with account of spin-orbit coupling
   (SOC) effects. The unrestricted HartreeFock (UHF) method,
   multi-configuration self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations with
   linear and quadratic response techniques and MRCI method have been
   implemented. The Breit-Pauli form of the SOC operator is used. NMR
   spectra of HOI, HOBr and IO- species are predicted. Photodissociation of
   the HOX molecules, which is crucial for the catalytic ozone-destruction
   cycle, is critically reviewed and analyzed. The singlet-triplet (S-T)
   transition to the lowest triplet state T-1(X(1)A'--> (3) A{''}) is
   responsible for the weak long-wavelength tail absorption which induces
   photodissociation of these molecules. These absorption bands (380, 450
   and 460 nm for X = Cl, Br and I, respectively) have small cross section,
   about (4, 15 and 24) X 10(-21) cm(2), respectively, but still axe
   important for dissociation process HOX --> X + OH and ozone
   concentration, since the stratosphere is transparent for such radiation.
   The second, more intense band (305, 350 and 406 mn for X = Cl, Br and I,
   respectively) is produced by two overlapping S-S and S-T transitions.
   The first singlet-singlet transition, S-0 - S-1, is relatively weak; it
   is responsible for about 95\% of the cross section in HOCl; in HOBr the
   S-0 - T-2 transition to the second triplet state contributes to this
   absorption band much more (about 50\%); in HOI this is mostly the S-0 -
   T-2 absorption. This band is strongly enhanced in HOI molecule because
   of the T-2 - S-4 SOC mixing and its wavelength is red-shifted. In order
   to check this assignment of very peculiar HOI spectrum, the ESR and UV
   spectral properties of IO radical have been calculated with the same
   approximation. A good agreement with the ESR, spectrum for the
   calculated nuclear quadrupole coupling constant and SOC splitting makes
   credit to the accuracy of HOI spectral interpretation.
   The third, most intensive UV absorption band (242, 280 and 340 nm for X
   = Cl, Br and I, respectively) in hypohalous acids is determined by the
   O-X bond polarized S-S transition to the second singlet exited state
   (X(1)A' --> 2(1)A'). All excited states are dissociative. The SOC
   account is of crucial importance for the absorption cross section
   calculations of the HOX molecules in the UV-visible part of solar
   actinic flux and for their lifetime in lower stratosphere. Account of
   SOC effect is also very important for the lifetime prediction of the
   halogen oxides and their anions.},

   and relatively strong bonding interactions. Among them, several types of
   homo- and hetero-dimers with importance to Earth's atmosphere: (H2O)(2),
   (N-2)(2), N-2-O-2, (O-2)(2), or (O-3)(2). Dimer of carbon dioxide
   (CO2)(2) is computed owing to its supposed significancy in the
   atmosphere of Venus. Systems with stronger bonding are represented by
   ClONO2H+ and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. The report also
   discusses computational tools, combining advanced quantum-chemical
   methods with statistical-mechanical treatments. The structure,
   energetics, and vibrations of the complexes are evaluated at correlated
   ab initio levels. The computations typically show several minimum-energy
   structures and their relative populations are sensitive to temperature.
   The computed dimerization equilibrium constants are of a special
   interest as a critical stability measure and an input information for
   evaluations of the altitude population profiles in the atmosphere. A
   special attention is paid to the temperature enhancement of clustering
   degree in saturated vapors. This interesting paradox represents a
   product of atmospheric studies though it is actually a phenomenon of a
   more general physico-chemical validity. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{An intramolecular theory of the mass-independent isotope effect for
   ozone. II. Numerical implementation at low pressures using a loose
   transition state}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2000},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {9497-9509},
Abstract = {A theory is described fur the variation in the rate constants for
   formation of different ozone isotopomers from oxygen atoms and molecules
   at low pressures. The theory is implemented using a simplified
   description which treats the transition state as loose. The two
   principal features of the theory are a phase space partitioning of the
   transition states of the two exit channels after formation of the
   energetic molecule and a small (ca. 15\%) decrease in the effective
   density of states, rho {[}a `'no n-Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM)
   effect{''}], for the symmetric ozone isotopomers {[}B. C. Hathorn and R.
   A. Marcus, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 4087 (1999)]. This decrease is in
   addition to the usual statistical factor of 2 for symmetric molecules.
   Experimentally, the scrambled systems show a ``mass-independent'' effect
   for the enrichments delta (for trace) and E (for heavily) enriched
   systems, but the ratios of the individual isotopomeric rate constants
   for unscrambled systems show a strongly mass-dependent behavior. The
   contrasting behavior of scrambled and unscrambled systems is described
   theoretically using a `'phase space'' partitioning factor. In scrambled
   systems an energetic asymmetric ozone isotopomer is accessed from both
   entrance channels and, as shown in paper I, the partitioning factor
   becomes unity throughout. In unscrambled systems, access to an
   asymmetric ozone is only From one entrance channel, and differences in
   zero-point energies and other properties, such as the centrifugal
   potential, determine the relative contributions (the partitioning
   factors) of the two exit channels to the lifetime of the resulting
   energetic ozone molecule. They are responsible for the large differences
   in individual recombination rate constants at low pressures. While the
   decrease in rho for symmetric systems is attributed to a small non-RRKM
   effect eta, these calculated results are independent of the exact origin
   of the decrease. The calculated ``mass-independent'' enrichments, delta
   and E, in scrambled systems are relatively insensitive to the transition
   state (TS), because of the absence of the partitioning factor in their
   case (for a fixed non-RRKM eta). They are compared with the data at room
   temperature. Calculated results for the ratios of individual
   isotopomeric rate constants for the strongly mass-independent behavior
   for unscrambled systems are quite sensitive to the nature of the TS
   because of the partitioning effect. The current data are available only
   at room temperature but the loose TS is valid only at low temperatures.
   Accordingly, the results calculated for the latter at 140 K represent a
   prediction, for any given eta. At present, a comparison of the 140 K
   results can be made only with room temperature data. They show the same
   trends as, and are in fortuitous agreement, with the data. Work is in
   progress on a description appropriate fur room temperature. (C) 2000

Abstract = {The distribution of ozone isotopomers in ozone mixtures produced by
   electric discharge in mixtures of O-16(2) and O-18(2) at 77 K was
   measured by high-resolution FTIR spectroscopy. It was of key importance
   to assess not only the total amount of isotopomers of a certain mass but
   also the relative amounts of corresponding asymmetric and symmetric
   ozone species of the same mass given as the ratios
   {[}(OOO)-O-16-O-16-O-18]/{[}(OOO)-O-16-O-18-O-16] and
   {[}(OOO)-O-16-O-18-O-18]/{[}(OOO)-O-18-O-16-O-18]. For many purposes
   both ratios have been assumed to have the statistical value 2.00. Pure
   rotational spectra in the far-IR region (30-100 cm(-1)) were recorded
   for three different O-18-enriched ozone mixtures, all at 0.00185 cm(-1)
   resolution. All the spectra were corrected for thermal emission.
   Linestrengths for individual lines in a particular spectrum were
   measured by means of a fitting technique taking into account
   contributions from all other lines in the spectrum. For this purpose
   theoretical linestrengths for all six ozone species containing O-16 and
   O-18. Obtained from a quantum-number-dependent dipole operator were
   used. The ratios between observed and theoretical linestrengths were
   used to determine the abundances of individual isotopomers in a
   particular ozone mixture. For one of the ozone samples the abundances of
   all six ozone species were determined within 1\% relative uncertainty.
   For the three ozone mixtures studied, the ratio between asymmetric and
   symmetric species of mono-O-18 ozone were determined to 1.99(2),
   2.01(2), and 2.10(6). The ratio between asymmetric and symmetric species
   of di-O-18 ozone were determined to 2.51(4), 2.42(10), and 2.46(3). (C)

Abstract = {The collisions of translationally hot O(D-1) with O-2 result in two
   processes, translational energy relaxation and electronic quenching to
   O(P-3). These two processes were studied in a gas cell at room
   temperature using the vacuum ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence
   technique. The initial hot O(D-1) atoms were produced by the
   photodissociation of N2O at 193 nm, which have average translational
   energies of 18.1 kcal mol(-1) in the laboratory frame. Time-resolved
   measurements of the Doppler profiles for the hot O(D-1) atoms revealed
   the translational energy relaxation process, whereas the quenching
   process was investigated by measuring both the decrease of the O(D-1)
   concentration and the increase of the product O(P-3) concentration at
   various delay times after the photochemical formation of the hot O(D-1)
   atoms. From the simulation employing an elastic hard-sphere collision
   model with a Monte Carlo method, the hard-sphere diameter for the
   translational energy relaxation process of hot O(D-1) by collisions with

   a little smaller than that at the thermal collision energy at 298 K. The

Abstract = {Photodissociation reaction of O-3 following ultraviolet photon
   excitation around the thermodynamic threshold of the dissociation
   channel of O(D-1) + O-2(a(1)Delta g) at 309.44 nm has been studied under
   room-temperature and jet-cooled conditions. Both O(D-1) and O(P-3)
   photoproducts are detected by a technique of vacuum ultraviolet
   laser-induced fluorescence (VUV-LIF) spectroscopy. Photofragment
   excitation (PHOFEX) spectra for the O(D-1) and O(P-3) atoms are obtained
   by scanning the photolysis laser wavelength between 297 and 316 nm while
   monitoring VUV-LIF signal intensities at 115 and 130 nm for O(D-1) and
   O(P-3), respectively. From the behavior of the PHOFEX spectra for the
   O(P-3) and O(D-1) atoms around the threshold into O(D-1) + O-2(a(1)Delta
   g), the existence of an exit barrier along the O-O-2 dissociation
   coordinate in the photoexcited electronic state of O-3 is suggested.
   Analysis of the lint widths in the jet-cooled PHOFEX spectra of O(D-1)
   and O(P-3) suggests that the quasi-bound states below the barrier and
   above the threshold have lifetimes of 0.2-0.8 ps. The O(D-1) quantum
   yield values from the O-3 photolysis are obtained from the PHOFEX
   spectrum for O(P-3) at 295 K. The O(D-1) quantum yields between 297 and
   305 nm are almost independent of the photolysis wavelength (approximate
   to 0.89), which is smaller than the current NASA/JPL recommendation for
   atmospheric modeling (0.95). The physical model for O(D-1) formation in
   the photolysis of O-3 in the wavelength range 305-329 nm is presented,
   which can quantitatively explain the temperature and wavelength
   dependence of O(D-1) quantum yield.},

   distorted face-centered-cubic (fcc) and hexagonal-closed-packed (hcp)
   lattice structures. New harmonic and anharmonic constants are determined
   that lead to matrix dependent calculated energy levels. Changes are
   significant for harmonic and third-order anharmonic ones. Moreover the
   symmetry of the potential in which the ozone oxygen nuclei move is shown
   to be altered. Calculated energy levels compare well with observed ones
   and allow predictions of unobserved ones. The 2 nu(3)-->nu(3)
   fluorescence observed in different rare gas matrices is confirmed.
   Transition moments hardly differ from one matrix to the other for 2
   nu(3)-->nu(3) and nu(1)+nu(3) transitions although for the latter, it is
   one order-of-magnitude higher in a double than in a single
   substitutional site. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

Abstract = {A theoretical model is elaborated which allows methods used in gas phase
   to be applied to calculate the vibrational energies and transition
   moments for low-lying levels of O-3 trapped in rare gas matrices. The
   model used in a previous work allowed only one mode to be handled at a
   time. With the new approach, an overall treatment of low-lying levels is
   achieved. The trapping site, a single or double substitutional one is
   distorted to minimize the free energy of the molecule-matrix system. The
   molecule is considered to be submitted to the net electric field present
   in the site as the result of the distortion and polarization of the
   matrix atoms. New harmonic and anharmonic constants that lead to matrix
   dependent calculated energy levels and transition moments can then be
   determined. Besides confirmation of two trapping sites, a single (S1)
   and a double (S2) substitutional site in a distorted face-centered-cubic
   (fcc) lattice structure, two other S1 sites in argon and krypton in a
   distorted hexagonal-closed-packed (hcp) lattice structure are shown to
   be possible. A fit within experimental uncertainty is reached between
   observed and calculated frequencies for fundamental bands v(1), v(2),

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1999},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {4087-4100},
Abstract = {An intramolecular theory of the unusual mass-independent isotope effect
   for ozone formation and dissociation is described. The experiments
   include the enrichment factor, its dependence on the ambient pressure,
   the ratio of the formation rates of symmetric and asymmetric ozone
   isotopomers, the enrichment of ozone formed from heavily enriched oxygen
   isotopes, the comparison of that enrichment to that when the heavy
   isotopes are present in trace amounts, the isotopic exchange rate
   constant, and the large mass-dependent effect when individual rate
   constants are measured, in contrast with the mass-independent effect
   observed for scrambled mixtures. To explain the results it is suggested
   that apart from the usual symmetry number ratio of a factor of 2, the
   asymmetric ozone isotopomers have a larger density of reactive (coupled)
   quantum states, compared with that for the symmetric isotopomers (about
   10\%), due to being more ``RRKM-like{''}
   (Rice-Ramsperger-Kessel-Marcus): Symmetry restricts the number of
   intramolecular resonances and coupling terms in the Hamiltonian which
   are responsible for making the motion increasingly chaotic and, thereby,
   increasingly statistical. As a result the behavior occurs regardless of
   whether the nuclei are bosons (O-16, O-18) or fermions (O-17). Two
   alternative mechanisms are also considered, one invoking excited
   electronic states and the other invoking symmetry control in the
   entrance channel. Arguments against each are given. An expression is
   given relating the mass-independent rates of the scrambled systems to
   the mass-dependent rates of the unscrambled ones, and the role played by
   a partitioning term in the latter is described. Different definitions
   for the enrichment factor for heavily enriched isotopic systems are also
   considered. In the present paper attention is focused on setting up
   theoretical expressions and discussing relationships. They provide a
   basis for future detailed calculations. (C) 1999 American Institute of

Abstract = {The geometry and vibrational frequencies of the ozone molecule are
   studied using the reduced multireference coupled cluster method with
   singles and doubles (RMR CCSD) relying on a two-electron/two-orbital (2,
   2) active space. The role played by the choice of the reference space is
   analyzed in detail by considering both the spin adapted,
   two-configuration reference space and the complete three-configuration
   reference space based on the (2, 2) active space. It is shown that while
   the two-reference RMR CCSD approach, using the C-2 upsilon
   symmetry-adapted (2,2) active space, provides a better description of
   the geometry and harmonic frequencies of symmetric vibrational modes
   than the standard single-reference (SR) CCSD method, the three-reference
   approach is essential to achieve an accurate description of the harmonic
   frequency of the asymmetric stretching mode. A unique behavior of ozone
   in this regard is highlighted by a comparison with other symmetric
   triatomics. The comparison with results obtained by other methods,
   including the SR configuration interaction with singles and doubles
   (CISD), the standard SR CCSD, as well as two-reference and large
   reference space MR CISD methods, clearly demonstrates the superiority of
   the RMR CCSD approach. In fact, the performance of a small reference
   space RMR CCSD method is similar to that of a large reference space MR
   CISD, thus enabling a compact description of both dynamical and
   nondynamical correlation effects in states having a multireference

Title = {{Stratospheric ozone depletion: A review of concepts and history}},
Journal = {Rev. Geophys.},
Year = {1999},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {275-316},
Abstract = {Stratospheric ozone depletils on through catalytic chemistry involving
   man-made chlorofluorocarbons is an area of focus in the study of
   geophysics and one of the global environmental issues of the twentieth
   century. This review presents a brief history of the science of ozone
   depletion and describes a conceptual framework to explain the key
   processes involved, with a focus on chemistry. Observations that may be
   considered as evidence (fingerprints) of ozone depletion due to
   chlorofluorocarbons are explored, and the related gas phase and surface
   chemistry is described. Observations of ozone and of chlorine-related
   trace gases near 40 km provide evidence that gas phase chemistry has
   indeed currently depleted about 10\% of the stratospheric ozone there as
   predicted, and the vertical and horizontal structures of this depletion
   are fingerprints for that process. More striking changes are observed
   each austral spring in Antarctica, where about half of the total ozone
   column is depleted each September, forming the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Measurements of large amounts of ClO, a key ozone destruction catalyst,
   are among the finger- prints showing that human releases of
   chlorofluorocarbons are the primary cause of this change. Enhanced ozone
   depletion in the Antarctic and Arctic regions is linked to heterogeneous
   chlorine chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of polar stratospheric
   clouds at cold temperatures. Observations also show that some of the
   same heterogeneous chemistry occurs on the surfaces of particles present
   at midlatitudes as well, and the abundances of these particles are
   enhanced following explosive volcanic eruptions. The partitioning of
   chlorine between active forms that destroy ozone and inert reservoirs
   that sequester it is a central part of the framework for our
   understanding of the 40-km ozone decline, the Antarctic ozone hole, the
   recent Arctic ozone losses in particularly cold years, and the
   observation of record midlatitude ozone depletion after the major
   eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the early 1990s. As human use of
   chlorofluorocarbons continues to decrease, these changes throughout the
   ozone layer are expected to gradually reverse during the twenty-first
   century.},

   the dissociation of internally excited ozone molecules to form both

   spin-forbidden to spin-allowed formation increases as the wavelength is
   increased, and is more pronounced at the peaks in the structured Huggins

   absorption to a state of B-1(2) symmetry, followed by curve crossing to
   tripler states which lead to fragmentation. The implications for the

   find an adiabatic energy of 9963+/-4 cm(-1), in excellent agreement with
   that determined earlier from vibronic isotope shifts observed at lower
   resolution, 9990+/-70 cm(-1). We also find an asymmetric stretching
   frequency of 367+/-17 cm(-1), indicating that the (3)A(2) state
   potential energy surface is bound against dissociation to O+O-2 despite
   the fact that it lies above the corresponding dissociation limit.
   Rotational structure associated with transitions to the B-3(2) state is

   spectra for both species have been measured by scanning the
   photodissociation laser wavelength whilst monitoring vuv-LIF at 115 nm
   {[}O(D-1)] and 130 nm {[}O(P-3(j))]. After applying suitable corrections
   for the relative detection sensitivities, suitably weighted combinations
   of these PHOFEX spectra were found to provide a quantitative match to
   the parent O-3 absorption spectrum both at 295 and 227 K, thereby
   providing a method of determining both the wavelength and temperature
   dependence of the absolute O(D-1) quantum yield, Phi(1D)(lambda,T). Hot
   band excitation of internally excited O-3 molecules and dissociation via
   the spin-allowed channel yielding O(D-1) + O-2(a (1) Delta(g)) products

Title = {{Infrared high-resolution spectra of ozone in the range 5500-5570cm(-1):
   analysis of nu(2)+5 nu(3) and nu(1)+nu(2)+4 nu(3) bands}},

Abstract = {The nu 2 + 5 nu(3) and nu(1) + nu(2) + 4 nu(3) bands of ozone, which
   occur in the 5500 cm(-1) region, have been observed for the first time
   using a Fourier transform spectrometer, operating at 0.008 cm(-1)
   resolution and with a large pathlength x pressure product (3216 cm x
   28.3 Torr). The assignment of rotation-vibration transitions has been
   done for J up to 35 and Ka up to 12, for the nu(2) + 5 nu(3) band and up
   to J = 40 and Ka = 2 for the nu(1) + v(2) + 4 nu(3) band respectively.
   The effective Hamiltonian used in calculations accounts for the
   first-order Coriolis coupling between these two bands. In addition, as
   the levels corresponding to Ka = 5 are perturbed, it was necessary to
   account for anharmonic resonance with the (321) state. Also, to
   correctly reproduce the levels of (015) with Ka = 8, 9, 10 it has been
   necessary to include a Coriolis coupling with (080) state in the model.
   In this way, we have obtained a very satisfactory r.m.s. deviation of
   2.4 x 10(-3) cm(-1), near the experimental accuracy. Rovibrational line
   intensities of nu(2) + 5 nu(3) and nu(1) + nu(2) + 4 nu(3) bands were
   measured and the value of the principal transition moment constants have
   been recovered. Finally a complete list of line positions and
   intensities was calculated leading to the integrated band intensity of
   S-nu = 9.33 x 10(-23) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) for the nu(2) + 5 nu(3)
   band and S-nu = 1.44 x 10(-23) cm(-1)/molecule cm(-2) for the nu(1) +
   nu(2) + 4 nu(3) band at 296K with a cut-off of 3 x 10(-26).},

Abstract = {Accurate values for the dipole polarizability of the cyclic form of

   near-Hartree-Fock values of 16.09 and -9.12 e(2)a(0)(2)E(h)(-1) for the
   mean value (<(alpha)over bar>) and the anisotropy (Delta alpha) of the

   by only a few per cent but has a stronger effect on Delta alpha. Our
   CCSD(T) values, obtained with a {[}9s6p5d1f] basis set, are <(alpha)over

   two lowest states of (1)A `' symmetry. The calculations are performed in
   the diabatic representation and include the coupling between the two
   relevant states. All three nuclear degrees of freedom are taken into
   account. The two potentiaI-energy surfaces, the coupling potential, and
   the two transition-dipole-moment functions with the electronic ground
   state have been calculated previously by ab initio methods {[}Woywod er
   nl., J. Chem. Phys. 107, 7282 (1997)]. The coupling between the two
   diabatic states is exceedingly strong, resulting in very fast
   dissociation into O+O-2 on the time scale of only one symmetric stretch
   period. A small portion of the initially created wave packet is
   temporarily trapped leading to three tiny recurrences, which reflect
   basically symmetric stretch motion plus same amount of bending motion.
   The experimentally observed diffuse vibrational structures superimposed
   to the broad absorption spectrum are satisfactorily reproduced and
   discussed both in the time-independent and the time-dependent picture of
   spectroscopy. In view of the very short lifetime in the excited states,
   the correspondingly large widths of the diffuse structures, and the
   participation of all three vibrational modes we conclude that an unique
   assignment in terms of three quantum numbers is not possible. The main
   structures are due to symmetric stretch excitation, but bending and even
   asymmetric stretch motion are also involved. A one-state model, in which
   only the upper (bound) adiabatic potential is employed, provides a
   qualitatively correct explanation of the absorption spectrum and the
   diffuse structures. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

   reference intermediate Hamiltonian theory. It is not a CC method but
   deals in a great part with the same physical effects that CC methods
   that incorporate amplitudes of triples such as CCSDT or its CCSDT-ln
   approaches. A number of test calculations comparing to diverse CC
   methods, as well as FCI and experiment when available, have been
   performed. The tests concern equilibrium energies in NH3 and CH2,
   equilibrium energies and distances in some diatomics (BF, NO+, CN+, C-2,
   BeO), different bond breaking situations (H2O, BH, HF, SiH2) and
   spectroscopic properties of different bonding conditions (Li-2, LiNa,

   CCSDT ones in the equilibrium regions and close to CCSDT-1 along most
   dissociation curves. A few exceptions to this rule are analyzed with the
   help of an approach to MVTD that does not take into account the effects
   of linked quadriexcitations. Such analysis suggests the interest of
   improving the treatment of effects of linked triples in the MVTD model.
   The separate contributions of linked and unlinked triples and quadruples
   are also analyzed for some of the above diatomics representing different
   behaviors of bond breaking. The interest of such analysis is illustrated
   in the NeH+ molecule. The MVTD results show, in general, a high quality,

   approximating the complete CISDTQ. (C) 1997 American Institute of

Abstract = {The bifurcation structure is investigated for a Hamiltonian for the
   three coupled nonlinear vibrations of a highly excited triatomic
   molecule. The starting point is a quantum Hamiltonian used to fit
   experimental spectra. This Hamiltonian includes 1:1 Darling-Dennison
   resonance coupling between the stretches, and 2:1 Fermi resonance
   coupling between the stretches and bend: A classical Hamiltonian is
   obtained using the Heisenberg correspondence principle. Surfaces of
   Section show a pronounced degree of chaos at high energies, with a
   mixture of chaotic and regular dynamics. The large-scale bifurcation
   structure is found semianalytically; without recourse to numerical
   solution of Hamilton's equations, by taking advantage of the fact that
   the spectroscopic Hamiltonian has a conserved polyad quantum number,
   corresponding to an approximate constant of the motion of the molecule.
   Bifurcation diagrams are analyzed for a number of molecules including
   H2O, D2O, NO2, ClO2, O-3, and H2S. (C) 1997 American Institute of

   to the dissociative continuum of O(D-1) + O-2(a (1) Delta(g)) was also

   the hot band excitation was the antisymmetric stretching mode v(3) in
   the ground electronic state of ozone. Sharp peaks corresponding to

Abstract = {Potential-energy surfaces of the 1 (1)A', 1 (1)A `', and 2 (1)A `'
   states of ozone and corresponding transition-dipole-moment surfaces have
   been computed as a function of the two bond distances and the bond
   angle. The calculations are based on the complete-active-space
   self-consistent field (CASSCF) and multiconfigurational second-order
   perturbation theory (CASPT2) electronic-structure models. For the
   calculations of the (1)A `' surfaces, which exhibit a conical
   intersection, a diabatic representation has been constructed, employing
   a direct diabatization method implemented at the CASSCF level. The slow
   variation of the diabetic potentials and transition dipole moments with
   nuclear geometry allows us to perform the nb initio calculations on a
   widely spaced grid. The complete potential-energy and
   transition-dipole-moment surfaces are then efficiently obtained by
   interpolation. This procedure leads to very significant savings of
   computing time compared to the mapping of the rapidly varying potentials
   and derivative couplings in the conventional adiabatic representation.
   Diabatic potentials at the CASPT2 level have been obtained by applying
   the adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation constructed at the CASSCF level
   to the adiabatic CASPT2, potentials. The properties of the resulting
   adiabatic and diabatic (1)A `' potential-energy surfaces are discussed,
   with emphasis on the 1 (1)A `'-2 (1)A `' conical intersection, which is
   of relevance for the photodissociation dynamics of ozone in the Chappuis
   band. The computation of the photoabsorption cross section and the
   comparison between theory and experiment are discussed in the

Abstract = {The global features of the potential energy surfaces of the lowest two

   determined for the critical regions. Contour maps are generated on a
   variety of planes and curved surfaces cutting through the two energy
   surfaces in various directions to obtain a full understanding of the
   three-dimensional characteristics of both surfaces. Perimetric internal
   coordinates are used so that the three atoms are treated on an equal
   footing.
   The 1(1)A' state, the ground state, has a ring minimum and three
   equivalent open minima, all lying in C-2v-restricted coordinate spaces.
   Direct dissociation to O-2 + O is only possible from the open minima.
   The lowest energy path from the ring minimum first leads to an open
   minimum before going to dissociation. The transition states between the
   ring minimum and the open minima also have C-2v symmetry. Close to these
   transition states lie the three open minima of the 2(1)A' state, which
   has no ring minimum. Isomerization between the open minima is highly
   unlikely in the ground state, but not excluded in the excited state.
   Both states dissociate into the same state of O-2 + O, namely the ground
   state O(P-3)+ O-2((3) Sigma(g)(-)) whose energy lies between that of the
   1(1)A' End 2(1) A' open minima. There exists an extended. interestingly
   shaped region in coordinate space in which the two states come very
   close to each other. It contains an intersection seam between the two
   states consisting of four branches connected by three knots.

   approach each other to within two-thirds of the O-2 bond length. At the

Abstract = {Ozone depletion remains one of the major social-political environmental

   growing public awareness and concern. As stratospheric ozone decreases
   so does the protection it offers from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The
   grave consequences of unchecked ozone depletion on the Ear th's
   biological systems has provided the impetus for a global research effort
   to determine the causes find effects of ozone depletion. To date, major
   attention has been given to ozone destruction cycles catalysed by the
   chemical by-products which result from the photolysis of man-made
   chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides. However in order to
   understand the underlying chemistry and physics of ozone depletion a
   wide range of laboratory studies and detailed theoretical calculations
   are also needed to characterize ozone dissociation dynamics and
   electronic structure. A full characterization of ozone spectroscopy and
   dissociation dynamics is far from complete. This is in part due to the
   difficulty in preparing such a reactive (and unstable) molecule for the
   necessary laboratory studies and partly due to the difficulty in
   accurately modelling ozone's ground state structure. Thus despite its
   crucial importance, studies of ozone spectroscopy and collision dynamics
   have only been refined within the last decade. In this review, the
   structure, spectroscopy and dissociation pathways of ozone will be

   Average enrichments, weighted by molecular O-48(3) density, of (15 +/-

Abstract = {We describe a two-dimensional (2D) imaging technique for recording

   recorded as 2D sections of the 3D angular distributions using
   state-specific ionization in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. We
   compare this method to previous methods that record 2D projections of
   the 3D distribution. The 2D sections represent cartesian flux-velocity
   maps in the center of mass and are related to angle-velocity
   differential cross sections by a simple geometric factor. Two studies
   are highlighted. In the first, new results are presented for the A state
   photodissociation of CH3I to CH3+I. (theta,upsilon) images are presented
   for I atom in the P-2(3/2) and P-2(1/2) spin-orbit states following
   photodissociation at 266 and 304 nm. The principal result is detection
   of the weak perpendicular transitions to the (3)Q(1) state (at 304 nm)
   and the le state (at 266 nm) that underlie the strong parallel
   transition to the (3)Q(0) state. We also report the ratio of cross

   branching ratio for I(P-2(3/2)) and I(P-2(1/2)), and the (3)Q(0)-(1)Q

Abstract = {Using a Fourier transform spectrometer, we have recorded the spectra of

   strongest absorption in this region is due to the nu(1) + nu(2) + 3
   nu(3) band which is in Coriolis interaction with the nu(2) + 4 nu(3)
   band. We have been able to assign more than 1700 transitions for these
   two bands. To correctly reproduce the calculation of energy levels, it
   has been necessary to introduce the (320) state which strongly perturbs
   the (113) and (014) states through Coriolis- and Fermi-type resonances.
   Seventy transitions of the 3 nu(1) + 2 nu(2) band have also been
   observed. The final fit on 926 energy levels with J(max) = 50 and K-max
   = 16 gives rms = 3.1 x 10(-3) cm(-1) and provides a satisfactory
   agreement of calculated and observed upper levels for most of the

Abstract = {The 2v(1) + 2v(3) band of ozone, appearing in the 4150 cm(-1) region has
   been observed for the first time, using the high resolution Reims FTS
   and a large p x l product of 3616 cm x 48 torr. 275 transitions have
   been assigned, involving J and K-a up to 55 and 9, respectively. The fit
   on the 193 corresponding energy levels using single Watson type
   Hamiltonian leads to a standard deviation of 1.4 x 10(-3) cm(-1), on the
   order of experimental accuracy. Line intensities are also measured and
   calculated with suitable transition moment operators. We report here the
   set of parameters as well as transition moment operators. A complete
   list, with a cut-off of: 1 x 10(-26) cm(-1)/mol.cm(-1) has been
   generated which leads to a band intensity S-v(2v(1) + 2v(3)) = 1.175 x

Abstract = {By means of a crossed-beam technique, we have conducted absolute
   differential cross-section measurements for the excitation of ozone's
   Hartley band by electron impact. The angular range covered was from 12
   degrees to 156 degrees, while the impact energies employed were 7, 10,
   15, and 20 eV. The angular distributions indicate that the Hartley band
   has a composite nature, arising from at least one optically allowed and
   at least one optically forbidden transition. Candidates for these
   transitions are indicated with help from the results of theoretical
   calculations. Unfortunately, aside from the well known 1 B-1(2) <-- X
   (1)A(1) allowed transition observed in optical spectra, definitive
   assignments for these transitions cannot yet be made. Integrated cross
   sections were calculated from the measured differential cross sections.
   The former exhibit a maximum near 15-eV impact.},

Journal = CP,
Year = {1995},

Pages = {45-64},
Abstract = {We report the results of ab initio calculations of the nonadiabatic Born
   coupling terms for the two lowest-lying singlet A `' excited states of
   ozone ((1)A(2) and B-1(1) in C-2v symmetry) whose electronic potential
   energy surfaces exhibit a crossing at a bond angle near 120 degrees.
   Since photoexcitation from the ground state to these A `' states is
   believed to be responsible for the Chappuis band of ozone, determination
   of the nonadiabatic coupling terms in the molecular Hamiltonian is
   therefore likely to be of importance in understanding the
   predissociative features of the spectrum. The nuclear derivative
   coupling matrix elements are computed between ab initio electronic
   wavefunctions obtained from multi-reference configuration interaction
   (MRD-CI) calculations in a basis of configuration state functions
   constructed from MCSCF orbitals. The first-derivative nonadiabatic
   coupling terms are calculated analytically in a manner similar to the
   calculation of analytic energy gradients, thereby avoiding the
   cumbersome numerical differentiation of CI and SCF coefficients, The
   calculated analytical derivative coupling matrix elements are used to
   determine a suitable transformation to a quasidiabatic basis.},

   yields at the two temperatures show the same initial wavelength
   dependence in the fall-off region, in contrast to literature
   measurements of the O)(D-1) yields which show a shift;in the fall-off
   curve to shorter wavelengths at low temperature. For lambda > 309nm, the
   yield at 227K falls more rapidly than that at 298K, confirming that
   internal energy mediated dissociation of ozone provides the major source
   of O-2(a(1) Delta(g)) at wavelengths just beyond the 310nm threshold for
   the spin allowed production, of the two singlet products. However, the
   yields of O-2(a(1) Delta(g)) at 227K and 298K were found to be

Abstract = {The photodissociation of O-3 in the Hartley band has been investigated

   lambda(diss)=248 nm we determined the quantum yield of the dominant
   decay channel leading to O-2((1) Delta(g))+O(D-1) and the fragment
   vibrational state distribution. The fragment recoil anisotropy
   (beta=1.25+/-0.15) was found to be independent of the fragment
   vibrational states. Between lambda(diss)=275 and 295 nm beta assumes a
   value of 1.6+/-0.2, which exceeds the value expected for a simple
   impulsive process. Photofragment yield measurements carried out by PTS
   between 272 and 286 nm revealed a strong fluctuation of the vibrational
   state distribution with lambda(diss). Based on the small but distinct
   structure superimposed on the broad continuum of the Hartley band and
   the findings of recent 3D wave packet calculations, we propose this
   fluctuation, a manifestation of wavelength-dependent partial cross
   sections, to arise predominantly from an interference effect. The latter
   occurs between the part of the initially prepared wavepacket which
   propagates directly into the exit channel and a (minor) part which is
   temporarily trapped by the motion of the bending and symmetric
   stretching modes in the excited O-3 molecule. (C) 1995 American

   molecules. A near degeneracy of the 3(12) and 4(04), levels of
   (OOO)-O-17-O-16-O-16 causes strong perturbations of the hyperfine
   patterns, gives rise to perturbation-allowed Delta J = 2. transitions,
   and provides an accurate determination of chi(ab). This has allowed the
   calculation of the angle between the principal axis of the quadrupole
   tenser and the O-O bond. The O-17 spin-rotation interactions of
   (OSO)-O-17-O-16 have been measured for comparison with the corresponding
   values in O-3, and improved values of the quadrupole coupling have been
   obtained. Paramagnetic shielding and chemical shifts for O-17 have been
   calculated from the spin-rotation constants for both compounds.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present measurements of O(D-1) quantum yields of ozone
   photolysis, phi(lambda), in the wavelength region between 300 and 330 nm
   and at 355 nm. The data are obtained from an experiment which is based
   on the reaction of O(D-1) atoms with water and the subsequent detection
   of the generated OH by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Due to the
   performance of this method, providing a high level of accuracy and
   precision, it was possible to answer the question concerning the
   wavelength dependence of the O(D-1) quantum yield in the threshold
   region. In particular, the value of phi(lambda) at 302.5 nm was
   determined to be unity, the existence of a saddle point at 315 nm was
   verified, and the wavelength of the threshold was determined to be
   between 331 and 333 nm. In addition, measurements performed at 355 nm
   have shown a negligible contribution to the O(D-1) quantum yield. Thus,
   it can be deduced that a participation of the spin-forbidden process
   with the products O(D-1) and O-2((3) Sigma(g)(-)) is unlikely.},

Pages = {215-227},
Abstract = {The relative quantum yields for the formation of O-2(a (1) Delta(g))
   from the photolysis of ozone have been measured between 270 and 329 nm
   at room temperature, and between 300 and 322 nm at 227 K, near the
   fall-off region for the formation of spin-allowed singlet products O-2(a
   (1) Delta(g)) and O(D-1(2)). The molecular fragment was detected by
   resonance enhanced multiphoton ionisation at 331.5 nm. The measurements
   were put on an absolute scale by comparison with previous measurements
   in the short-wavelength region. The results at room temperature are in
   excellent agreement with the recommended quantum yields for O(D-1(2))
   production at wavelengths up to 310 nm, but at longer wavelengths
   exhibit a pronounced tail of 10-20\% out to at least 329 nm.
   Measurements at 227 K are identical to those at room temperature between
   300 and 309 nm, and do not show a shift in the fall-off curve to shorter
   wavelengths as has been reported in the literature for O(D-1(2)). For
   wavelengths between 309 and 319 nm the yield of O-2(a (1) Delta(g)) is
   smaller than that at room temperature and this, together with the
   results of measurements at fixed wavelengths as a function of
   temperature, confirms that the photolysis of internally excited ozone
   provides a major source of O-2(a (1) Delta(g)) at wavelengths just
   beyond 310 nm. For wavelengths greater than or equal to 320 nm the
   quantum yield is found to be approximately constant at the two
   temperatures, and suggests that spin-forbidden dissociation of ozone is
   taking place as the dominant process in this long-wavelength region. The
   results are compared with recent modelling calculations for the
   formation of the O(D-1(2)) product in the fall-off region which take
   into account the spin-allowed dissociation; of internally excited ozone
   molecules. Good agreement is found at wavelengths up to 320 nm,
   particularly at room temperature, and suggests that the formation of
   singlet products extends noticeably beyond the fall-off region. The
   implications of this for stratospheric and atmospheric modelling are
   briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {A spectrometer capable of detecting ozone absorption features 9 orders

   excited states often believed to play a role in atmospheric chemistry is
   available in the form of vibrational and rotational structure. We have
   analyzed these spectra using a combination of digital filtering and
   isotope substitution and find evidence for three electronically excited
   states below 1.5 eV. The lowest of these states is metastable, bound by
   similar to 0.1 eV and probably the (3)A(2) rather than the B-3(2) state.
   Its adiabatic electronic energy is 1.24 +/- 0.01 eV, slightly above the
   dissociation energy of the ground state. Two higher states, at 1.29 +/-
   0.03 and 1.48 +/- 0.03 eV, are identified as the B-3(2) and the B-3(1),

   data on the low-lying electronic states of ozone, these results imply
   that these are, in fact, the lowest three excited states; that is, there
   are no electronically excited states of ozone lying below the energy of

   on the Sheppard-Walker PES near quantitatively reproduced the
   characteristic recurrence features in the autocorrelation function
   obtained by Johnson and Kinsey from the experimental spectrum of Freeman
   et al. This is in contrast to previously reported three-dimensional
   calculations which showed a factor of 10 higher recurrence intensities
   compared to the experimentally derived one. The absorption spectrum,
   obtained as the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function, is in
   excellent agreement with the experimental spectrum and exhibits the
   unique features seen on top of the experimental spectrum, which has
   caused considerable theoretical interest over recent years. Calculations

Abstract = {Recently, the coupled cluster method has been generalized to a
   two-determinant reference (TD-CC method) applicable to open-shell
   singlet states. In this paper, we report the formulas and an efficient
   algorithm to calculate analytic energy derivatives for this new method.
   The implementation has been carried out in the ACES II many-body nb
   initio program system. The new method was first applied to the B-1(u)
   state of butadiene and several excited states of ozone. We report
   geometries and one-electron properties for those states.},

Abstract = {Highly vibrationally excited O-2(X(3) Sigma(g)(-), v greater than or

   (O-3), and the quantum yield for this reaction has been determined for
   excitation at 226 nanometers. This observation may help to address the
   `'ozone deficit'' problem, or why the previously predicted stratospheric
   O-3 concentration is less than that observed. Recent kinetic studies
   have suggested that O-2(X(3) Sigma(g)(-), v greater than or equal to 26)
   can react rapidly with O-2 to form O-3 + O and have led to speculation
   that, if produced in the photodissociation of O-3, this species might be
   involved in resolving the discrepancy. The sequence O-3 + h nu -->

   Sigma(g)(-), v greater than or equal to 26) + O-2 --> O-3 + O (where h
   nu is a photon) would be an autocatalytic mechanism for production of
   odd oxygen. A two-dimensional atmospheric model has been used to
   evaluate the importance of this new mechanism. The new mechanism can
   completely account for the tropical O-3 deficit at an altitude of 43
   kilometers, but it does not completely account for the deficit at higher
   altitudes. The mechanism also provides for isotopic fractionation and
   may contribute to an explanation for the anomalously high concentration
   of heavy O-3 in the stratosphere.},

   interaction of states. The well-known double minimum potential of the

Title = {{A detailed evaluation of the heating efficiency in the middle atmosphere}},
Journal = JGRA,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {98},
Pages = {10517-10541},
Abstract = {The conversion to heat of solar ultraviolet radiation absorbed by ozone
   and molecular oxygen in the terrestrial mesosphere and lower
   thermosphere occurs through a series of complex processes. Upon
   photolysis of the O3 or O2, significant amounts of chemical potential
   energy and atomic and molecular internal energy are generated. The
   disposition of the internal energy largely determines the rate at which
   the atmosphere is heated. In addition, the chemical energy is released
   subsequent to exothermic chemical reactions which may occur long after
   and far away from the location of photon deposition. Energy may be lost
   from the atmosphere by airglow from excited photolysis products or by
   chemiluminescent emission from product species of exothermic chemical
   reactions. In this paper we examine the role of airglow losses in
   reducing the efficiency of solar heating in the Hartley, Huggins, and
   Chappuis bands of ozone and in the Herzberg, Ly alpha, Schumann-Runge
   continuum, and Schumann-Runge bands of molecular oxygen. We also examine
   the role of heating due to seven chemical reactions and calculate the
   efficiencies for those reactions with significant chemiluminescent loss.
   Parameterizations of the heating efficiency that are readily applicable
   to numerical models are given for those processes with nonunit
   efficiencies. Results from the calculation of heating rates for
   individual processes indicate that the reaction of atomic hydrogen and
   ozone is potentially the largest single source of heat in the vicinity
   of the mesopause. However, significant improvement is still needed in
   the knowledge of the quenching and chemical reaction rates of
   vibrationally excited OH before the efficiency of this reaction can be
   confidently calculated. Our calculations also indicate that even under
   strong quenching, most of the OH is in vibrationally excited form above
   85-90 km. Finally, the bulk heating efficiency due to the combination of
   solar and chemical heating is calculated. The calculated bulk
   efficiencies demonstrate that airglow and chemiluminescent emission
   significantly reduce the amount of energy available for heat throughout
   the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.},

Abstract = {The first two excited singlet states of ozone are discussed in light of

   + O fragmentation, the two 1 1A2 and 1 1B1 states undergo an avoided
   crossing resulting in the C1A{''} and D1A{''} states.  The D1A{''} state

   found to possess a local minimum away from the Franck-Condon area at

Abstract = {The electronic ground state of ozone and, in particular, its equilibrium
   geometry and harmonic vibration frequencies was studied by a variety of
   multiconfiguration and single-configuration methods. It is well known
   that the antisymmetric stretch frequency cannot be correctly obtained by
   single-reference methods unless at least triple excitations are
   included. Extensive comparison with other work in the literature shows
   that basis-set effects must be taken into account since the omega3
   frequency is very sensitive to computational details. The
   multiconfiguration methods are shown to give good results provided that
   an adequate configuration space is used. In particular, the second-order
   complete active space perturbation method performs very satisfactorily.
   Traditional multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods,
   using a few reference functions, do not perform so well. A two-reference
   CI is able to give reasonable results, but only when the orbitals have
   been prepared by some properly correlated method. Adding several
   reference functions gives small improvements, and the result is
   capriciously dependent on the type of reference functions included. The
   success of the perturbation method, as well as an extreme type of MRCI,
   indicates that it is far more important to include a large number of
   diverse configurations in the reference than to treat the remaining
   dynamical correlation accurately.},

   that the Wulf band is probably due to the 3A2 state of ozone which gains
   intensity through spin-orbit coupling. The 1 1A{''} (1A2) state gives
   rise to the featureless red wing of the Chappuis band. Most of the
   structure in the Chappuis band is reproduced in the model and is due to
   the 2 1A{''} (1B1) state as was previously supposed. A more complete

Journal = PSS,
Year = {1992},
Volume = {40},

Abstract = {Laboratory studies and atmospheric experiments have shown that Non Local
   Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) processes must be considered to explain
   the infrared emission of ozone above 70km for a quiescent atmosphere.
   For these altitudes, in the calculation of ozone limb infrared
   radiances, a complete kinetic model describing the coupling between
   radiative and relaxation processes must be used. In this study a
   narrow-band statistical radiative transfer model, combined with a
   kinetic model, is proposed providing calculations of NLTE infrared limb
   emission by ozone with good accuracy. Moreover, because the calculations
   are very fast, contrary to models based on line-by-line calculations, it
   has been possible to assess the influence of the various atmospheric
   input parameters which are of importance for modelling available
   experimental data such as SPIRE (Green et al, 1986).},

Abstract = {The bootstrap fitting procedure is implemented to obtain molecular
   potential energy surfaces for the stretching degrees of freedom of ozone

   algorithm for fitting vibrational levels even in regions where the
   classical dynamics are globally chaotic; and third, the employment of a

   for the computation of eigenvalues of the potential. The approach was
   tested by using the stretching eigenvalues from a realistic empirical
   potential for water as input. Excellent agreement between the bootstrap

   various solvents, and fluorescence was observed from the nu-1 and nu-2
   levels. The fluorescence relaxation eigenvalues and a kinetic model gave
   relaxation probabilities per collision for the 2-nu-2, nu-1, and nu-2
   vibrational levels of OCS by Ar(l) at 84.4 K equal to > 1.1 x 10(-6),
   5.3(-1.1)+2.0 x 10(-7), and (2.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(-7), respectively. For
   Kr(l) at 116.8 K the respective probabilities were > 1.5 x 10(-6),
   4.3(-0.8)+1.7 x 10(-7), and (1.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(-7). For Xe(l) at 162.0 K
   the probabilities were > 1.1 x 10(-6), 2.9(-1.1)+1.8 x 10(-7), and (1.2
   +/- 0.1) x 10(-7), respectively. Relaxation of OCS by O2 was studied in
   mixtures of O2 in Ar(1), where the probabilities for relaxation of the
   nu-1 and nu-2 levels of OCS by O2 at 84.4 K were found to be
   2.6(-0.7)+1.1 x 10(-6) and (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-6), respectively.
   Following CO2 laser excitation of the nu-3 vibrational level of O3
   dilute in the different solvents, fluorescence was observed from the
   nu-2 level. A lower limit of approximately 1 x 10(-6) was determined for
   the relaxation probability per collision of the equilibrated nu-1 and
   nu-3 stretching levels of O3 by each of the four collision partners. The
   probabilities for relaxation of O3(nu-2) by Ar(1) at 84.4 K, Kr(1) at
   116.8 K, Xe(1) at 162.0 K, and O2(dilute in Ar(1)) at 84.4 K were (1.6
   +/- 0.2) x 10(-7), (2.9 +/- 0.4) x 10(-7), > 6.9 x 10(-7), and (7.7 +/-
   0.9) x 10(-7), respectively. A comparison is made between the relaxation
   rates measured in the liquid phase at cryogenic temperatures and rates
   measured in the gas phase at room temperature, using the isolated binary
   collision model and energy-transfer theory. Fourier transform spectra
   were recorded for OCS and O3 in Ar(1), Kr(1), and Xe(1) solutions at the
   aforementioned temperatures and in O2(1) at 78.6 K. Band centers,
   half-widths, and strengths are given for eight vibrational bands of
   (OCS)-O-16-C-12-S-32 and six bands of O-16(3) in the spectral range of
   500-3500 cm-1. The ratio of the vibrational transition dipole moments of
   the nu-3 and nu-1 vibrations of O3, which are strongly Coriolis coupled
   in the gas phase, was measured to be mu-3/mu-1 = 13.2 +/- 1.6 in liquid
   Ar and O2 solutions.},

Journal = {Faraday Discuss.},
Year = {1991},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {31-46},
Abstract = {The relation of diffuse vibrational structures in UV-absorption spectra
   of (small) polyatomic molecules and internal vibrational motion in
   excited electronic states are investigated. The method of choice is the
   propagation of time-dependent wavepackets with the autocorrelation
   function serving as the link between the energy dependence of the
   spectrum and the time dependence of the molecular motion in the excited
   electronic state. For the purpose of this paper we characterize diffuse
   structures as very short-lived resonances with `lifetimes' of the order
   of at most one internal vibrational period. In particular, we study a
   model system for the photodissociation of symmetric triatomic molecules
   ABA such as H2O, CO2 and O3, the photodissociation of H2O in the second
   continuum, and the fragmentation of H2S. The existence of unstable
   periodic orbits and their influence on the dissociation dynamics is
   especially elucidated. In the case of H2S we demonstrate that the
   diffuse absorption structures are caused by symmetric stretch motion in
   a binding state which is strongly coupled to a dissociative state.
   Diffuse structures can be regarded as very broad resonances in excited
   electronic states. They manifest transition-state spectroscopy in the
   original sense of the word.},

Abstract = {Recent results on the ab initio potential-energy surface (PES) and

   are the photodissociations of NaI and ozone, and the unimolecular
   dissociation of FHF-. The nonadiabatic coupling in the ion-covalent
   crossing region of the NaI dissociation is calculated based on the
   CASSCF-MRCI method and compared with experimental and empirical
   estimates. The PESs of the ozone photodissociation are calculated using
   the CASSCF-SECI method. Characteristics of the ground and the excited
   B-state PESs are compared with the existing PESs. The weak structure
   seen in the Hartley band is explained in terms of transition-state
   dynamics based on three-dimensional quantum calculations using new PESs.
   The CEPA PES of the unimolecular dissociation of FHF- to the F- + HF
   channel is calculated. Based on the quantum-mechanical variational
   calculation, the vibrationally highly excited FHF- anion above its
   dissociation threshold is suggested as a candidate of TSS of

Journal = JGRA,
Year = {1991},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {17217-17228},
Abstract = {The conversion of chemical potential energy and infrared radiative
   energy to kinetic energy by nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)
   processes involving ozone is a potentially significant source of heat in
   the terrestrial upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Heating rates
   in excess of 6 K d-1 could occur near the mesopause if all potential
   energy is converted to heat. Calculation of the heating rate requires
   knowledge of the processes which convert chemical potential energy to
   internal energy of ozone during the exothermic recombination reaction
   that forms ozone. In addition, the rates at which ozone exchanges
   internal energy with its surroundings through collisional and radiative
   processes must be known. The lack of a detailed data base of kinetic and
   spectroscopic information limits the ability to accurately model the
   heating by ozone. Therefore heating rates are calculated and compared
   using two different statistical equilibrium models previously applied in
   the analysis of measurements of limb emission from ozone. The calculated
   heating depends strongly on the assumed distribution and relaxation of
   energy in the quasi-nascent ozone molecule. Finally, in the absence of a
   detailed data base of rate coefficients it may be possible to estimate
   the heating rate due to non-LTE processes in ozone from appropriate
   satellite measurements of the ozone concentration and of the infrared
   emission from ozone in the 9-12-mu-m spectral interval.},

Abstract = {The mean heat capacity of ozone between 300 and 476 K has been
   determined from explosions of mixtures of ozone and oxygen in a
   spherical bomb by the method the authors described in a previous paper.
   The value obtained is 10.94 calories per mol of ozone. The value
   obtained from band spectra is 10.39 calories per mol. The difference
   cannot be accounted for by incorrect assignment of the optical
   frequencies of ozone, and it is larger than the probable experimental
   error. It is proposed that the difference may be due to a contribution
   to the heat capacity of an electronic level lying close to the ground
   state of the ozone molecule. It is estimated that this supposed level
   has an energy of 0.1 to 0.2 volt. The existence of low-energy electronic
   levels probably implies an isosceles triangle structure and paramagnetic
   properties of the ozone molecule in the normal and the low excited states.},
