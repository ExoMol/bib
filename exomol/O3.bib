Abstract = {{The state of the art analyses of high-resolution ozone spectra and a
   critical discussion of line parameters updated since the previous review

   and analyses of Fourier transform spectra below 5600 cm(-1) and review
   Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy measurements and analyses in the 5850-7920
   cm(-1) spectral region which have been performed for O-16(3) and all
   O-18 enriched ozone isotopologues. Various issues related to resonance
   perturbations due to dark states are discussed as well as the issues
   concerning the accuracy of the experimental parameters, the data
   modelling and the data reduction. Comparisons of vibration levels
   determined from spectra analyses with predictions from the molecular
   potential functions are given. The procedures of empirical corrections
   for calculated line lists are described and the ``intricate{''} question
   of absolute intensity determination is overviewed. Also, a review of
   deficiencies, challenge for improvements, and related works in progress
   are reported. }},

Title = {{Calculated vibrational states of ozone up to dissociation}},
Journal = JCP,

Volume = {{144}},
Abstract = {{A new accurate global potential energy surface for the ground electronic
   state of ozone {[}R. Dawes et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 201103 (2013)]
   was published fairly recently. The topography near dissociation differs
   significantly from previous surfaces, without spurious submerged reefs
   and corresponding van der Waals wells. This has enabled significantly
   improved descriptions of scattering processes, capturing the negative
   temperature dependence and large kinetic isotope effects in exchange
   reaction rates. The exchange reactivity was found to depend on the
   character of near-threshold resonances and their overlap with reactant
   and product wavefunctions, which in turn are sensitive to the potential.
   Here we present global ``three-well{''} calculations of all bound
   vibrational states of three isotopic combinations of ozone (O-48(3),
   (O2O)-O-16-O-18, (O2O)-O-16-O-17) for J = 0 and J = 1 with a focus on
   the character and density of highly excited states and discuss their
   impact on the ozone isotopic anomaly. The calculations were done using a
   parallel symmetry-adapted Lanczos method with the RV3 code. Some
   comparisons were made with results obtained with the improved relaxation
   method implemented in the Heidelberg multi-configuration time-dependent
   Hartree code. }},

Title = {{Stratospheric ozone depletion: A review of concepts and history}},
Journal = {Rev. Geophys.},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {275-316},
Abstract = {{Stratospheric ozone depletils on through catalytic chemistry involving
   man-made chlorofluorocarbons is an area of focus in the study of
   geophysics and one of the global environmental issues of the twentieth
   century. This review presents a brief history of the science of ozone
   depletion and describes a conceptual framework to explain the key
   processes involved, with a focus on chemistry. Observations that may be
   considered as evidence (fingerprints) of ozone depletion due to
   chlorofluorocarbons are explored, and the related gas phase and surface
   chemistry is described. Observations of ozone and of chlorine-related
   trace gases near 40 km provide evidence that gas phase chemistry has
   indeed currently depleted about 10\% of the stratospheric ozone there as
   predicted, and the vertical and horizontal structures of this depletion
   are fingerprints for that process. More striking changes are observed
   each austral spring in Antarctica, where about half of the total ozone
   column is depleted each September, forming the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Measurements of large amounts of ClO, a key ozone destruction catalyst,
   are among the finger- prints showing that human releases of
   chlorofluorocarbons are the primary cause of this change. Enhanced ozone
   depletion in the Antarctic and Arctic regions is linked to heterogeneous
   chlorine chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of polar stratospheric
   clouds at cold temperatures. Observations also show that some of the
   same heterogeneous chemistry occurs on the surfaces of particles present
   at midlatitudes as well, and the abundances of these particles are
   enhanced following explosive volcanic eruptions. The partitioning of
   chlorine between active forms that destroy ozone and inert reservoirs
   that sequester it is a central part of the framework for our
   understanding of the 40-km ozone decline, the Antarctic ozone hole, the
   recent Arctic ozone losses in particularly cold years, and the
   observation of record midlatitude ozone depletion after the major
   eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the early 1990s. As human use of
   chlorofluorocarbons continues to decrease, these changes throughout the
   ozone layer are expected to gradually reverse during the twenty-first
   century.}},

Title = {{Potential Biosignatures in Super-Earth Atmospheres II. Photochemical
   Responses}},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {415-438},
Abstract = {{Spectral characterization of super-Earth atmospheres for planets
   orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarf stars is a key focus in
   exoplanet science. A central challenge is to understand and predict the
   expected spectral signals of atmospheric biosignatures (species
   associated with life). Our work applies a global-mean
   radiative-convective-photochemical column model assuming a planet with
   an Earth-like biomass and planetary development. We investigated planets
   with gravities of 1g and 3g and a surface pressure of 1 bar around
   central stars with spectral classes from M0 to M7. The spectral signals
   of the calculated planetary scenarios have been presented in an earlier
   work by Rauer and colleagues. The main motivation of the present work is
   to perform a deeper analysis of the chemical processes in the planetary
   atmospheres. We apply a diagnostic tool, the Pathway Analysis Program,
   to explore the photochemical pathways that form and destroy biosignature
   species. Ozone is a potential biosignature for complex life. An
   important result of our analysis is a shift in the ozone photochemistry
   from mainly Chapman production (which dominates in Earth's stratosphere)
   to smog-dominated ozone production for planets in the habitable zone of
   cooler (M5-M7)-class dwarf stars. This result is associated with a lower
   energy flux in the UVB wavelength range from the central star, hence
   slower planetary atmospheric photolysis of molecular oxygen, which slows
   the Chapman ozone production. This is important for future atmospheric
   characterization missions because it provides an indication of different
   chemical environments that can lead to very different responses of
   ozone, for example, cosmic rays. Nitrous oxide, a biosignature for
   simple bacterial life, is favored for low stratospheric UV conditions,
   that is, on planets orbiting cooler stars. Transport of this species
   from its surface source to the stratosphere where it is destroyed can
   also be a key process. Comparing 1g with 3g scenarios, our analysis
   suggests it is important to include the effects of interactive
   chemistry.}},

Title = {{Absorption cross-sections of ozone in the ultraviolet and visible
   spectral regions: Status report 2015}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{327}},
Pages = {105-121},
Abstract = {{The activity ``Absorption Cross-Sections of Ozone{''} (ACSO) started in
   2008 as a joint initiative of the International Ozone Commission (IO3C),
   the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the IGACO
   ({''}Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations{''}) O-3/UV
   subgroup to study, evaluate, and recommend the most suitable ozone
   absorption cross-section laboratory data to be used in atmospheric ozone
   measurements. The evaluation was basically restricted to ozone
   absorption cross-sections in the UV range with particular focus on the
   Huggins band. Up until now, the data of Bass and Paur published in 1985
   (BP, 1985) are still officially recommended for such measurements.
   During the last decade it became obvious that BP (1985) cross-section
   data have deficits for use in advanced space-borne ozone measurements.
   At the same time, it was recognized that the origin of systematic
   differences in ground-based measurements of ozone required further
   investigation, in particular whether the BP (1985) cross-section data
   might contribute to these differences.
   In ACSO, different sets of laboratory ozone absorption cross-section
   data (including their dependence on temperature) of the group of Reims
   (France) (Brion et al., 1993, 1998, 1992, 1995, abbreviated as BDM,
   1995) and those of Serdyuchenko et al. (2014), and Gorshelev et al.
   (2014), (abbreviated as SER, 2014) were examined for use in atmospheric
   ozone measurements in the Huggins band.
   In conclusion, ACSO recommends:
   The spectroscopic data of BP (1985) should no longer be used for
   retrieval of atmospheric ozone measurements
   For retrieval of ground-based instruments of total ozone and ozone
   profile measurements by the Umkehr method performed by Brewer and Dobson
   instruments data of SER (2014) are recommended to be used. When SER
   (2014) is used, the difference between total ozone measurements of
   Brewer and Dobson instruments are very small and the difference between
   Dobson measurements at AD and CD wavelength pairs are diminished.
   For ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) measurements the
   use of BDM (1995) or SER (2014) is recommended.
   For satellite retrieval the presently widely used data of BDM (1995)
   should be used because SER (2014) seems less suitable for retrievals
   that use wavelengths close to 300 nm due to a deficiency in the
   signal-to-noise ratio in the SER (2014) dataset.
   The work of ACSO also showed:
   The need to continue laboratory cross-section measurements of ozone of
   highest quality. The importance of careful characterization of the
   uncertainties of the laboratory measurements.
   The need to extend the scope of such studies to other wavelength ranges
   (particularly to cover not only the Huggins band but also the comparison
   with the mid-infrared region).
   The need for regular cooperation of experts in spectral laboratory
   measurements and specialists in atmospheric (ozone) measurements.}},
