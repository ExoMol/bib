Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {172-190},
Abstract = {{The state of the art analyses of high-resolution ozone spectra and a
   critical discussion of line parameters updated since the previous review
   by Rinsland et al. {[}J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transfer 2003;82:207-18]
   are presented. We focus on recent works revisiting improved measurements
   and analyses of Fourier transform spectra below 5600 cm(-1) and review
   Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy measurements and analyses in the 5850-7920
   cm(-1) spectral region which have been performed for O-16(3) and all
   O-18 enriched ozone isotopologues. Various issues related to resonance
   perturbations due to dark states are discussed as well as the issues
   concerning the accuracy of the experimental parameters, the data
   modelling and the data reduction. Comparisons of vibration levels
   determined from spectra analyses with predictions from the molecular
   potential functions are given. The procedures of empirical corrections
   for calculated line lists are described and the ``intricate{''} question
   of absolute intensity determination is overviewed. Also, a review of
   deficiencies, challenge for improvements, and related works in progress
   are reported. }},

Title = {{Calculated vibrational states of ozone up to dissociation}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Abstract = {{A new accurate global potential energy surface for the ground electronic
   state of ozone {[}R. Dawes et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 201103 (2013)]
   was published fairly recently. The topography near dissociation differs
   significantly from previous surfaces, without spurious submerged reefs
   and corresponding van der Waals wells. This has enabled significantly
   improved descriptions of scattering processes, capturing the negative
   temperature dependence and large kinetic isotope effects in exchange
   reaction rates. The exchange reactivity was found to depend on the
   character of near-threshold resonances and their overlap with reactant
   and product wavefunctions, which in turn are sensitive to the potential.
   Here we present global ``three-well{''} calculations of all bound
   vibrational states of three isotopic combinations of ozone (O-48(3),
   (O2O)-O-16-O-18, (O2O)-O-16-O-17) for J = 0 and J = 1 with a focus on
   the character and density of highly excited states and discuss their
   impact on the ozone isotopic anomaly. The calculations were done using a
   parallel symmetry-adapted Lanczos method with the RV3 code. Some
   comparisons were made with results obtained with the improved relaxation
   method implemented in the Heidelberg multi-configuration time-dependent
   Hartree code. }},

abstract = {An update of spectroscopic line parameters for the 3.45-3.92 $\mu$m ozone bands is reported. The line list includes the parameters of 15 bands of the main isotopic species and of the v1$+$v2$+$v3 band of 16O16O18O and 16O18O16O. The results are based on previous high resolution laboratory studies. Comparisons of experimental spectra with an absorptance simulation of ozone based on the reported line list shows that the latter one is accurate enough for strong, medium, and weak transmittance in the 2550-2900 cm{\textminus}1 spectral range. The data are available on the Web in the Spectroscopy and Molecular Properties of Ozone (S\&MPO, http://smpo.iao.ru and http://ozone.univ-reims.fr) and HITRAN (http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/hitran/) databanks.},

Title = {{Stratospheric ozone depletion: A review of concepts and history}},
Journal = {Rev. Geophys.},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {275-316},
Abstract = {{Stratospheric ozone depletils on through catalytic chemistry involving
   man-made chlorofluorocarbons is an area of focus in the study of
   geophysics and one of the global environmental issues of the twentieth
   century. This review presents a brief history of the science of ozone
   depletion and describes a conceptual framework to explain the key
   processes involved, with a focus on chemistry. Observations that may be
   considered as evidence (fingerprints) of ozone depletion due to
   chlorofluorocarbons are explored, and the related gas phase and surface
   chemistry is described. Observations of ozone and of chlorine-related
   trace gases near 40 km provide evidence that gas phase chemistry has
   indeed currently depleted about 10\% of the stratospheric ozone there as
   predicted, and the vertical and horizontal structures of this depletion
   are fingerprints for that process. More striking changes are observed
   each austral spring in Antarctica, where about half of the total ozone
   column is depleted each September, forming the Antarctic ozone hole.
   Measurements of large amounts of ClO, a key ozone destruction catalyst,
   are among the finger- prints showing that human releases of
   chlorofluorocarbons are the primary cause of this change. Enhanced ozone
   depletion in the Antarctic and Arctic regions is linked to heterogeneous
   chlorine chemistry that occurs on the surfaces of polar stratospheric
   clouds at cold temperatures. Observations also show that some of the
   same heterogeneous chemistry occurs on the surfaces of particles present
   at midlatitudes as well, and the abundances of these particles are
   enhanced following explosive volcanic eruptions. The partitioning of
   chlorine between active forms that destroy ozone and inert reservoirs
   that sequester it is a central part of the framework for our
   understanding of the 40-km ozone decline, the Antarctic ozone hole, the
   recent Arctic ozone losses in particularly cold years, and the
   observation of record midlatitude ozone depletion after the major
   eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the early 1990s. As human use of
   chlorofluorocarbons continues to decrease, these changes throughout the
   ozone layer are expected to gradually reverse during the twenty-first
   century.}},

Title = {{Potential Biosignatures in Super-Earth Atmospheres II. Photochemical
   Responses}},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {415-438},
Abstract = {{Spectral characterization of super-Earth atmospheres for planets
   orbiting in the habitable zone of M dwarf stars is a key focus in
   exoplanet science. A central challenge is to understand and predict the
   expected spectral signals of atmospheric biosignatures (species
   associated with life). Our work applies a global-mean
   radiative-convective-photochemical column model assuming a planet with
   an Earth-like biomass and planetary development. We investigated planets
   with gravities of 1g and 3g and a surface pressure of 1 bar around
   central stars with spectral classes from M0 to M7. The spectral signals
   of the calculated planetary scenarios have been presented in an earlier
   work by Rauer and colleagues. The main motivation of the present work is
   to perform a deeper analysis of the chemical processes in the planetary
   atmospheres. We apply a diagnostic tool, the Pathway Analysis Program,
   to explore the photochemical pathways that form and destroy biosignature
   species. Ozone is a potential biosignature for complex life. An
   important result of our analysis is a shift in the ozone photochemistry
   from mainly Chapman production (which dominates in Earth's stratosphere)
   to smog-dominated ozone production for planets in the habitable zone of
   cooler (M5-M7)-class dwarf stars. This result is associated with a lower
   energy flux in the UVB wavelength range from the central star, hence
   slower planetary atmospheric photolysis of molecular oxygen, which slows
   the Chapman ozone production. This is important for future atmospheric
   characterization missions because it provides an indication of different
   chemical environments that can lead to very different responses of
   ozone, for example, cosmic rays. Nitrous oxide, a biosignature for
   simple bacterial life, is favored for low stratospheric UV conditions,
   that is, on planets orbiting cooler stars. Transport of this species
   from its surface source to the stratosphere where it is destroyed can
   also be a key process. Comparing 1g with 3g scenarios, our analysis
   suggests it is important to include the effects of interactive
   chemistry.}},
