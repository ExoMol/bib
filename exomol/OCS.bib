Abstract = {We present a transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter
   WASP-15b from 2.8-5.2 microns observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H
   grating. Our high signal-to-noise data, which has negligible red noise,
   reveals significant absorption by H2O (4.2 sigma) and CO2 (8.9 sigma).
   From independent data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches, we
   infer that WASP-15b's atmospheric metallicity is supersolar (greater
   than or similar to 15 x solar) and its carbon-to-oxygen ratio is
   consistent with solar, that together imply planetesimal accretion. Our
   general circulation model simulations for WASP-15b suggest that the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio we measure at the limb is likely representative
   of the entire photosphere due to the mostly uniform spatial distribution
   of H2O, CO2, and CO. We additionally see evidence for absorption by SO2
   and absorption at 4.9 mu m, for which the current leading candidate is
   OCS (carbonyl sulphide), albeit with several caveats. If confirmed, this
   would be the first detection of OCS in an exoplanet atmosphere and point
   towards complex photochemistry of sulphur-bearing species in the upper
   atmosphere. These are the first observations from the BOWIE-ALIGN survey
   which is using JWST's NIRSpec/G395H instrument to compare the
   atmospheric compositions of aligned/low-obliquity and
   misaligned/high-obliquity hot Jupiters around F stars above the Kraft
   break. The goal of our survey is to determine whether the atmospheric
   composition differs across two populations of planets that have likely
   undergone different migration histories (disc versus disc-free) as
   evidenced by their obliquities (aligned versus misaligned).},

abstract = {The high-order Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory (RSPT) can be applied for studying anharmonic vibrational problem formulated with the isomorphic Hougen Hamiltonian, but the resulting series usually possess slowly convergent or even divergent behavior. This flaw can be overcome by the resummation of such series with the multi-valued Hermite–Padé approximant (HPA) that accurately reproduces variational matrix eigenvalues provided the basis set is the same. Besides, the state-to-state juxtaposition of HPA branch points can provide an accurate quantitative description of resonance phenomena. Such resummation was earlier proven to be efficient for three- and four-atomic asymmetric top molecules, as well as for linear molecules CO2 and C2H2. In the present work, this technique was systematically applied for studying vibrational resonances of practically important isotopologues of the linear carbonyl sulfide molecule (16O12C32S, 16O12C34S, 16O13C32S, 18O12C32S, 16O12C33S, 16O13C34S). The isomorphic Hamiltonians were constructed using the ab initio equilibrium geometry and quartic PES calculated at the CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z level. The analysis of HPA common branch points of 125 vibrational states for each isotopologue predicted comprehensive resonance pictures. These resonances reproduced most of experimentally observed couplings and indicated a possible break down of the known polyad formula P=2v1+v2+4v3. The demonstrated efficiency of this purely ab initio approach opens a perspective of further studies of resonances phenomena of new and hardly accessible molecules.}
