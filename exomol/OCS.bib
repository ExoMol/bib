abstract = {A study of vibrational excitations of the OCS molecule in the framework of a polyad conserving local algebraic model is presented. The description starts establishing the Hamiltonian in configuration space in terms of normal modes and later on translated into an algebraic representation by introducing the bosonic realization for harmonic oscillator. Then a canonical transformation to local operators is applied, which in turn are mapped to SU(2) Morse like ladder operators to take into account anharmonicities from the outset. The obtained Hamiltonian is given in terms of local operators suitable to be applied to any molecular system, even to molecules with strong normal mode behavior. Our approach represents an advantage over methods based on configuration space at this level of approximation. This approach is applied to the principal isotopologue of OCS. The vibrational description was carried out including 86 experimental energies with rms=0.36cm-1, with a Hamiltonian involving 22 spectroscopic parameters plus three external parameters associated with the depth of the local potentials. A study of the isotopologues shows a correlation between the normal/local parameter recently introduced and their spectroscopic properties.}

abstract = {We report high-quality IR line lists of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) computed using an ab initio potential energy surface (PES) refined with selected energy levels from HITRAN2020 and experimental energies for highly excited vibrational states, and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T/Q/5+d)Z dipole moment surfaces (DMS). With PES accuracy σrms < 0.01 cm-1 for 16O12C32S levels and DMS fitting σrms = 1.3×10-7 au for potential energy < 15,000 cm-1, room-temperature IR line lists are generated for 12 OCS isotopologues in the 0–15,000 cm-1 range with S296K > 10-31 cm-1/molecule.cm-2, then combined into a composite line list of 9 million transitions, denoted Ames-296K. For high-temperature applications, an Ames-2000K OCS line list is constructed in the same range, including 7 OCS isotopologues, with J ≤ 240 and E' ≤ 23,000 cm-1 for 16O12C32/34S. The Ames line lists are compared to HITRAN, CDMS, JPL(2010) near-IR line list, ExoMol line list for 16O12C32S, and high-resolution experimental IR studies. Data issues and discrepancies are identified and discussed. The accuracy of energy levels and line positions in the Ames line lists have been further enhanced using reliable experimental-based effective Hamiltonian (EH) models from HITRAN, or more consistent 0th-2nd order adjustments derived from the band-by-band comparisons between EAmes and EMARVEL, ECDMS, and experimental data and models. We demonstrate the reliability and consistency of theoretical calculations may be utilized to determine more consistent empirical line positions, compared to direct MARVELization. The Ames-296K line list is evaluated against Pacific Northwest National Laboratory experimental cross sections, showing widespread improvements over HITRAN and ExoMol line lists in the range of 600-6500 cm-1. The Ames line lists with empirically corrected line positions will provide accurate, reliable, and more complete IR predictions to facilitate OCS spectra analysis and modeling in atmospheric and exoplanetary studies. The PES, DMS, and line list files are available online at 10.5281/zenodo.13906150 and 10.48667/6hcw-n617.}

Abstract = {We present a transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter
   WASP-15b from 2.8-5.2 microns observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H
   grating. Our high signal-to-noise data, which has negligible red noise,
   reveals significant absorption by H2O (4.2 sigma) and CO2 (8.9 sigma).
   From independent data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches, we
   infer that WASP-15b's atmospheric metallicity is supersolar (greater
   than or similar to 15 x solar) and its carbon-to-oxygen ratio is
   consistent with solar, that together imply planetesimal accretion. Our
   general circulation model simulations for WASP-15b suggest that the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio we measure at the limb is likely representative
   of the entire photosphere due to the mostly uniform spatial distribution
   of H2O, CO2, and CO. We additionally see evidence for absorption by SO2
   and absorption at 4.9 mu m, for which the current leading candidate is
   OCS (carbonyl sulphide), albeit with several caveats. If confirmed, this
   would be the first detection of OCS in an exoplanet atmosphere and point
   towards complex photochemistry of sulphur-bearing species in the upper
   atmosphere. These are the first observations from the BOWIE-ALIGN survey
   which is using JWST's NIRSpec/G395H instrument to compare the
   atmospheric compositions of aligned/low-obliquity and
   misaligned/high-obliquity hot Jupiters around F stars above the Kraft
   break. The goal of our survey is to determine whether the atmospheric
   composition differs across two populations of planets that have likely
   undergone different migration histories (disc versus disc-free) as
   evidenced by their obliquities (aligned versus misaligned).},

abstract = {The high-order Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory (RSPT) can be applied for studying anharmonic vibrational problem formulated with the isomorphic Hougen Hamiltonian, but the resulting series usually possess slowly convergent or even divergent behavior. This flaw can be overcome by the resummation of such series with the multi-valued Hermite–Padé approximant (HPA) that accurately reproduces variational matrix eigenvalues provided the basis set is the same. Besides, the state-to-state juxtaposition of HPA branch points can provide an accurate quantitative description of resonance phenomena. Such resummation was earlier proven to be efficient for three- and four-atomic asymmetric top molecules, as well as for linear molecules CO2 and C2H2. In the present work, this technique was systematically applied for studying vibrational resonances of practically important isotopologues of the linear carbonyl sulfide molecule (16O12C32S, 16O12C34S, 16O13C32S, 18O12C32S, 16O12C33S, 16O13C34S). The isomorphic Hamiltonians were constructed using the ab initio equilibrium geometry and quartic PES calculated at the CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z level. The analysis of HPA common branch points of 125 vibrational states for each isotopologue predicted comprehensive resonance pictures. These resonances reproduced most of experimentally observed couplings and indicated a possible break down of the known polyad formula P=2v1+v2+4v3. The demonstrated efficiency of this purely ab initio approach opens a perspective of further studies of resonances phenomena of new and hardly accessible molecules.}
