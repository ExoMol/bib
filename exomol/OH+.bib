Abstract = {{The OH+ ion is of critical importance to the chemistry in the
   interstellar medium and is a prerequisite for the generation of more
   complex chemical species. Submillimeter and ultraviolet observations
   rely on high quality laboratory spectra. Recent measurements of the
   fundamental vibrational band and previously unanalyzed Fourier transform
   spectra of the near-ultraviolet A(3)Pi-X-3 Sigma(-) electronic spectrum,
   acquired at the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak in 1989, provide
   an excellent opportunity to perform a global fit of the available data.
   These new optical data are approximately four times more precise as
   compared to the previous values. The fit to the new data provides
   updated molecular constants, which are necessary to predict the OH+
   transition frequencies accurately to support future observations. These
   new constants are the first published using the modern effective
   Hamiltonian for a linear molecule. These new molecular constants allow
   for easy simulation of transition frequencies and spectra using the
   PGOPHER program. The new constants improve simulations of higher J-value
   infrared transitions, and represent an improvement of an order of
   magnitude for some constants pertaining to the optical transitions.}},
