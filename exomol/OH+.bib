Title = {Low-energy dissociative recombination of  {OH$^+$} },
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {162},
Abstract = {Dissociative recombination of the OH+ ion with free electrons is modeled
   theoretically using a recently developed approach that is based on
   first-principles calculations and multichannel quantum defect theory.
   The coupling between the incident electron and the rovibrational motion
   of the ion is accounted for. The cross section of the process at
   collision energies 10(-6)-1 eV and the thermally averaged rate
   coefficient at 10-1000 K are evaluated. The obtained anisotropic rate
   coefficients agree well with the data from a recent experiment carried
   out at the Cryogenic Storage Ring, especially when compared to previous
   theoretical values, which are smaller than the experimental results by
   about a factor of about 30.},

    abstract = { We report on a cycling scheme for Doppler cooling of trapped OH+ ions using transitions between the electronic ground state X3Σ– and the first excited triplet state A3Π. We have identified relevant transitions for photon cycling and repumping, have found that coupling into other electronic states is strongly suppressed, and have calculated the number of photon scatterings required to cool OH+ to a temperature where Raman sideband cooling can take over. In contrast to the standard approach, where molecular ions are sympathetically cooled, our scheme does not require co-trapping of another species and opens the door to the creation of pure samples of cold molecular ions with potential applications in quantum information, quantum chemistry, and astrochemistry. The laser cooling scheme identified for OH+ is efficient despite the absence of near-diagonal Franck–Condon factors, suggesting that broader classes of molecules and molecular ions are amenable to laser cooling than commonly assumed. }

Title = {Dissociative Recombination of Rotationally Cold  {OH$^+$}  and Its
   Implications for the Cosmic Ray Ionization Rate in Diffuse Clouds},
Journal =ApJL,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {955},
Abstract = {Observations of OH+ are used to infer the interstellar cosmic ray
   ionization rate in diffuse atomic clouds, thereby constraining the
   propagation of cosmic rays through and the shielding by interstellar
   clouds, as well as the low energy cosmic ray spectrum. In regions where
   the H-2-to-H number density ratio is low, dissociative recombination
   (DR) is the dominant destruction process for OH+ and the DR rate
   coefficient is important for predicting the OH+ abundance and inferring
   the cosmic ray ionization rate. We have experimentally studied DR of
   electronically and vibrationally relaxed OH+ in its lowest rotational
   levels, using an electron-ion merged-beams setup at the Cryogenic
   Storage Ring. From these measurements, we have derived a kinetic
   temperature rate coefficient applicable to diffuse cloud chemical
   models, i.e., for OH+ in its electronic, vibrational, and rotational
   ground level. At typical diffuse cloud temperatures, our kinetic
   temperature rate coefficient is a factor of similar to 5 times larger
   than the previous experimentally derived value and a factor of similar
   to 33 times larger than the value calculated by theory. Our combined
   experimental and modeling results point to a significant increase for
   the cosmic ray ionization rate inferred from observations of OH+ and
   H2O+, corresponding to a geometric mean of (6.6 +/- 1.0) x 10(-16)
   s(-1), which is more than a factor of 2 larger than the previously
   inferred values of the cosmic ray ionization rate in diffuse atomic
   clouds. Combined with observations of diffuse and dense molecular
   clouds, these findings indicate a greater degree of cosmic ray shielding
   in interstellar clouds than has been previously inferred.},

Abstract = {Molecular ions are key reaction intermediates in the interstellar

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{840}},
Abstract = {{The OH+ ion is of critical importance to the chemistry in the
   interstellar medium and is a prerequisite for the generation of more
   complex chemical species. Submillimeter and ultraviolet observations
   rely on high quality laboratory spectra. Recent measurements of the
   fundamental vibrational band and previously unanalyzed Fourier transform
   spectra of the near-ultraviolet $A\ ^3\Pi - X\ ^3\Sigma^-$ electronic spectrum,
   acquired at the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak in 1989, provide
   an excellent opportunity to perform a global fit of the available data.
   These new optical data are approximately four times more precise as
   compared to the previous values. The fit to the new data provides
   updated molecular constants, which are necessary to predict the OH+
   transition frequencies accurately to support future observations. These
   new constants are the first published using the modern effective
   Hamiltonian for a linear molecule. These new molecular constants allow
   for easy simulation of transition frequencies and spectra using the
   PGOPHER program. The new constants improve simulations of higher J-value
   infrared transitions, and represent an improvement of an order of
   magnitude for some constants pertaining to the optical transitions.}},

Title = { {OH$^+$}  IN ASTROPHYSICAL MEDIA: STATE-TO-STATE FORMATION RATES,
   EINSTEIN COEFFICIENTS AND INELASTIC COLLISION RATES WITH {He}},
Journal = ApJ
Volume = {794},
year ={2014},
Abstract = {The rate constants required to model the OH+ observations in different
   regions of the interstellar medium have been determined using state of
   the art quantum methods. First, state-to-state rate constants for the
   H-2(V = 0, J = 0, 1) + O+ ((4) S) -> H + OH+ (X-3 Sigma(-),v `, N)
   reaction have been obtained using a quantum wave packet method. The
   calculations have been compared with time-independent results to assess
   the accuracy of reaction probabilities at collision energies of about 1
   meV. The good agreement between the simulations and the existing
   experimental cross sections in the 0.01-1 eV energy range shows the
   quality of the results. The calculated state-to-state rate constants
   have been fitted to an analytical form. Second, the Einstein
   coefficients of OH+ have been obtained for all astronomically
   significant rovibrational bands involving the X-3 Sigma and/or A(3) Pi
   electronic states. For this purpose, the potential energy curves and
   electric dipole transition moments for seven electronic states of OH+
   are calculated with ab initio methods at the highest level, including
   spin orbit terms, and the rovibrational levels have been calculated
   including the empirical spin rotation and spin spin terms. Third, the
   state-to-state rate constants for inelastic collisions between He and
   014 (X-3 Sigma,2) have been calculated using a time-independent close
   coupling method on a new potential energy surface. All these rates have
   been implemented in detailed chemical and radiative transfer models.
   Applications of these models to various astronomical sources show that
   inelastic collisions dominate the excitation of the rotational levels of
   OH. In the models considered, the excitation resulting from the chemical
   formation of OH+ increases the line fluxes by about 10\% or less
   depending on the density of the gas.},

Title = {First interstellar detection of  {OH$^+$}},
Journal = AA,

Abstract = {The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12 m telescope was used to
   observe the N = 1-0, J = 0-1 ground-state transitions of OH+ at 909.1588
   GHz with the CHAMP+ heterodyne array receiver. Two blended hyperfine
   structure transitions were detected in absorption against the strong
   continuum source Sagittarius B2(M) and in several pixels offset by 18
   `'. Both absorption from Galactic center gas and absorption from diffuse
   clouds in intervening spiral arms in a velocity range from -116 to 38.5
   kms(-1) is observed. The total OH+ column density of absorbing gas is
   2.4 x 10(15) cm(-2). A column density local to Sgr B2(M) of 2.6 x 10(14)
   cm(-2) is found. On the intervening line-of-sight, the column density
   per unit velocity interval is in the range of 1 to 40x10(12)
   cm(-2)/(kms(-1)). OH+ is found to be on average more abundant than other
   hydrides, such as SH+ and CH+. Abundance ratios of OH and atomic oxygen
   to OH+ are found in the range of 10(1-2) and 10(3-4), respectively. The
   detected absorption of a continuous velocity range on the line-of-sight
   shows OH+ to be an abundant component of diffuse clouds.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {518},
Abstract = {We report the detection of absorption lines by the reactive ions OH+,
   H2O+ and H3O+ along the line of sight to the submillimeter continuum
   source G10.6-0.4 (W31C). We used the Herschel HIFI instrument in dual
   beam switch mode to observe the ground state rotational transitions of
   OH+ at 971 GHz, H2O+ at 1115 and 607 GHz, and H3O+ at 984 GHz. The
   resultant spectra show deep absorption over a broad velocity range that
   originates in the interstellar matter along the line of sight to
   G10.6-0.4 as well as in the molecular gas directly associated with that
   source. The OH+ spectrum reaches saturation over most velocities
   corresponding to the foreground gas, while the opacity of the H2O+ lines
   remains lower than 1 in the same velocity range, and the H3O+ line shows
   only weak absorption. For LSR velocities between 7 and 50 kms(-1) we
   estimate total column densities of N(OH+) >= 2.5 x 10(14) cm(-2),
   N(H2O+) similar to 6 x 10(13) cm(-2) and N(H3O+) similar to 4.0 x 10(13)
   cm(-2). These detections confirm the role of O+ and OH+ in initiating
   the oxygen chemistry in diffuse molecular gas and strengthen our
   understanding of the gas phase production of water. The high ratio of
   the OH+ by the H2O+ column density implies that these species
   predominantly trace low-density gas with a small fraction of hydrogen in
   molecular form.},

Title = {Detection of  {OH$^+$}  and H2O<SUP>+</SUP> towards Orion

Journal = AA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {521},
Abstract = {We report observations of the reactive molecular ions OH+, H2O+, and
   H3O+ towards Orion KL with Herschel/HIFI. All three N = 1-0
   fine-structure transitions of OH+ at 909, 971, and 1033 GHz and both
   fine-structure components of the doublet ortho-H2O+ 1(11)-0(00)
   transition at 1115 and 1139 GHz were detected; an upper limit was
   obtained for H3O+, OH+ and H2O+ are observed purely in absorption,
   showing a narrow component at the source velocity of 9 km s(-1), and a
   broad blueshifted absorption similar to that reported recently for HF
   and para-(H2O)-O-18, and attributed to the low velocity outflow of Orion
   KL. We estimate column densities of OH+ and H2O+ for the 9 km s(-1)
   component of 9 +/- 3x10(12) cm(-2) and 7 +/- 2x10(12) cm(-2), and those
   in the outflow of 1.9 +/- 0.7x10(13) cm(-2) and 1.0 +/- 0.3x10(13)
   cm(-2). Upper limits of 2.4x10(12) cm(-2) and 8.7x10(12) cm(-2) were
   derived for the column densities of ortho and para-H3O+ from transitions
   near 985 and 1657 GHz. The column densities of the three ions are up to
   an order of magnitude lower than those obtained from recent observations
   of W31C and W49N. The comparatively low column densities may be
   explained by a higher gas density despite the assumption of a very high
   ionization rate.},
