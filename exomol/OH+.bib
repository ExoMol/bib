Title = {{Improved Ultraviolet and Infrared Oscillator Strengths for OH$^+$}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2018},
Volume = {855},
Abstract = {Molecular ions are key reaction intermediates in the interstellar
   medium. OH+ plays a central role in the formation of more complex
   chemical species and for estimating the cosmic ray ionization rate in
   astrophysical environments. Here, we use a recent analysis of a
   laboratory spectrum in conjunction with ab initio methods to calculate
   infrared and ultraviolet oscillator strengths. These new oscillator
   strengths include branch dependent intensity corrections, arising from
   the Herman-Wallis effect, that have not been included before. We
   estimate 10\% total uncertainty in the UV and 6\% total uncertainty in
   the IR for the oscillator strengths.},

Title = {{Fourier Transform Spectroscopy of the $A\ ^3\Pi - X\ ^3\Sigma^-$ Transition of OH$^+$}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{840}},
Abstract = {{The OH+ ion is of critical importance to the chemistry in the
   interstellar medium and is a prerequisite for the generation of more
   complex chemical species. Submillimeter and ultraviolet observations
   rely on high quality laboratory spectra. Recent measurements of the
   fundamental vibrational band and previously unanalyzed Fourier transform
   spectra of the near-ultraviolet $A\ ^3\Pi - X\ ^3\Sigma^-$ electronic spectrum,
   acquired at the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak in 1989, provide
   an excellent opportunity to perform a global fit of the available data.
   These new optical data are approximately four times more precise as
   compared to the previous values. The fit to the new data provides
   updated molecular constants, which are necessary to predict the OH+
   transition frequencies accurately to support future observations. These
   new constants are the first published using the modern effective
   Hamiltonian for a linear molecule. These new molecular constants allow
   for easy simulation of transition frequencies and spectra using the
   PGOPHER program. The new constants improve simulations of higher J-value
   infrared transitions, and represent an improvement of an order of
   magnitude for some constants pertaining to the optical transitions.}},
