  abstract = {Subtracting the changing sky contribution from the near-infrared (NIR)
   spectra of faint astronomical objects is challenging and crucial to a
   wide range of science cases such as estimating the velocity dispersions
   of dwarf galaxies, studying the gas dynamics in faint galaxies,
   measuring accurate redshifts, and any spectroscopic study of faint
   targets. Since the sky background varies with time and location, NIR
   spectral observations, especially those employing fiber spectrometers
   and targeting extended sources, require frequent sky-only observations
   for calibration. However, sky subtraction can be optimized with
   sufficient a priori knowledge of the sky's variability. In this work, we
   explore how to optimize sky subtraction by analyzing 1075
   high-resolution NIR spectra from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope's
   SPIRou on Maunakea, and we estimate the variability of 481 hydroxyl (OH)
   lines. These spectra were collected during two sets of three nights
   dedicated to obtaining sky observations every 5.5 minutes. During the
   first set, we observed how the Moon affects the NIR, which has not been
   accurately measured at these wavelengths. We suggest accounting for the
   Moon contribution at separation distances less than 10 degrees when (1)
   reconstructing the sky using principal component analysis, (2) observing
   targets at YJHK magnitudes fainter than similar to 15, and (3)
   attempting a sky subtraction better than 1\%. We also identified 126
   spectral doublets, or OH lines that split into at least two components,
   at SPIRou's resolution. In addition, we used Lomb-Scargle periodograms
   and Gaussian process regression to estimate that most OH lines vary on
   similar timescales, which provides a valuable input for IR spectroscopic
   survey strategies. The data (https://zenodo.org/records/13363061) and
   code (https://github.com/FDauphin/spirou-sky-subtraction) developed for

JQSRT, 168 (2016) 142] contains the high-quality line frequencies, yet the line intensities need refinement because the model function used to interpolate the RKR potential and to extrapolate it into the repulsion region was not analytic [Medvedev et al. Mol. Phys. doi: 10.1080/00268976.2024.2395439], and also because the coupling between the ground X2Π and first excited A2Σ+ electronic states was treated by the perturbation theory. In this paper, we performed ab initio calculations of all necessary molecular functions at r=0.4-8.0 bohr, and then we construct fully analytic model functions entering the Hamiltonian. The model functions were fitted to both the ab initio data and the available experimental data on the line positions and energy levels, the relative line intensities, and the transition dipole moments derived from the measured permanent dipoles. The system of three coupled Schrödinger equations for two multiplet components of the X state plus the A state was solved to calculate the energy levels and the line intensities. The new set of the Einstein A coefficients permits to decrease the scatter of the logarithmic populations of the ro-vibrational levels derived from the observed radiation fluxes [Noll et al. Atmos. Chem. Phys. 20 (2020) 5269], to achieve better agreement with the measured relative intensities, and to obtain significant differences in the intensities of the Λ doublets for large v and J as observed by Noll et al. The X-A coupling fully modifies the Q-line intensities at high J by removing the well-known J−2 dependence. A new line list is constructed where the transition frequencies are from Brooke et al. and the Einstein A coefficients are from the present study. However, not all the problems with the intensities were resolved, presumably due to the neglect of the interaction with the 4Σ−,2Σ− and 4Π repulsive electronic terms.}

   explores the spot variability of 13 T Tauri Stars (TTSs) in the

   of atomic Fe i at similar to 1.56259 mu m and similar to 1.56362 mu m,
   and molecular OH at similar to 1.56310 and similar to 1.56317 mu m, we
   develop an empirical equivalent width ratio (EWR) relationship for T eff
   in the range of 3400-5000 K. This relationship allows for precise
   relative T eff estimates to within tens of Kelvin and demonstrates
   compatibility with solar metallicity target models. However,
   discrepancies between observational data and model predictions limit the
   extension of the T eff-EWR relationship to a broader parameter space.
   Our study reveals that both classical and weak-line TTSs can exhibit T
   eff variations exceeding 150 K over a span of 2 yr. The detection of a
   quarter-phase delay between the EWR and radial velocity phase curves in
   TTSs indicates spot-driven signals. A phase delay of 0.06 +/- 0.13 for
   CI Tau, however, suggests additional dynamics, potentially caused by
   planetary interaction, inferred from a posited 1:1 commensurability
   between the rotation period and orbital period. Moreover, a positive
   correlation between T eff variation amplitude and stellar inclination
   angle supports the existence of high-latitude spots on TTSs, further
   enriching our understanding of stellar surface activity in young stars.},

Predissociation lifetimes are determined by discretizing continuum states in the variational method nuclear motion calculation by restricting the calculation to a finite range of internuclear separations. Varying this range gives a series of avoided crossings between quasi-bound states associated with the A 2Σ+ and continuum states, from which predissociation lifetimes are extracted. 424 quasi-bound A 2Σ+ state rovibronic energy levels are analyzed, and 374 predissociation lifetimes are produced, offering good coverage of the predissociation region. Agreement with measured lifetimes is satisfactory, and a majority of computed results were within experimental uncertainty. A previously unreported A 2Σ+ state predissociation channel that goes via X 2Π is identified in the calculations. A Python package, binSLT, produced to calculate predissociation lifetimes, associated line broadening parameters, and lifetime uncertainties is made available. The PECs and other curves from this work will be used to produce a rovibronic ExoMol line list and temperature-dependent photodissociation cross sections for the hydroxyl radical.},

   forms excited OH which emits at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths via 
   highly excited rotational lines. These lines have only been detected
   with Spitzer in proto-planetary disks and shocks. Previous studies 
   have shown that they are a unique diagnostic for water photodissociation. 
   Thanks to its high sensitivity and angular resolution, the James Webb 
   Space Telescope (JWST) could be able to detect them in other environments 
   such as interstellar photodissociation regions (PDRs).
   Aims. Our goal is to predict OH MIR lines for a large range of 
   thermal pressures and UV fields in PDRs.
   Methods. We use the Meudon PDR Code to compute the thermal and 
   chemical structure of PDRs. In order to predict the emerging spectrum of OH, 
   we amended the code to include prompt emission induced by H2O photodissociation 
   between 114 and 143 nm. We performed a detailed study of the influence 
   of thermal pressure (Pth/k = nHTK) and UV field strength on the integrated 
   intensities and their detectability with the JWST.
   Results. OH MIR emission is predicted to originate very close to the H0/H2 
   transition and is directly proportional to the column density of water 
   photodissociated in that layer. Because gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions 
   forming water require relatively high temperatures (TK ≳ 300 K), the resulting 
   OH MIR lines are primarily correlated with the temperature at this position, and 
   are therefore brighter in regions with high pressure. This implies that these lines 
   are predicted to be only detectable in strongly irradiated PDRs (G0incident > 103) 
   with high thermal pressure (Pth/k ≳ 5x107 K cm–3). In the latter case, OH MIR lines 
   are less dependent on the strength of the incident UV field. The detection of such 
   lines in PDRs such as the Orion bar – which should be possible – is also 
   investigated and we show that the line-to-continuum ratio could be a major 
   limitation for detection because of instrumental limitations.
   Conclusions. OH MIR lines observable by JWST are a promising diagnostic for dense 
   and strongly irradiated PDRs and proplyds. Their intensities are directly 
   proportional to the amount of water photodissociated and they are therefore 
   an indirect but sensitive probe of the gas temperature at the H0/H2 transition.}

Our derived metallicities range from −1.2 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; + 0.5, a span of 1.7 dex. In addition we use isochrone projection to obtain masses of 1.6–4.3 M ⊙, and ages assuming single-star evolution. The oldest of these stars is 1.5 Gyr while the youngest and most metal-rich is only 100 Myr. The wide range in metallicity poses interesting questions concerning the chemical evolution and enrichment of the NSC and adds to the evidence for the presence of a young, metal-rich population in the NSC.

   transit is a powerful tool for detecting molecular absorption in these
   planets.
   Aims. We aim to assess the presence and detectability of OH in the
   atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b.
   Methods. We use high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a transit
   of WASP-76b obtained using CARMENES. After validating the OH line list,
   we generate model transit spectra of WASP-76b with petitRADTRANS. The
   data are corrected for stellar and telluric contamination and
   cross-correlated with the model spectra. After combining all
   cross-correlation functions from the transit, a detection map is
   constructed. Constraints on the planet properties from the OH absorption
   are obtained from a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.
   Results. OH is detected in the atmosphere of WASP-76b with a peak
   signal-to-noise ratio of 6.1. From the retrieval we obtain K-p = 232 +/-
   12 km s(-1) and a blueshift of - 13.2 +/- 1.6 km s(-1), which are offset
   from the expected velocities. Considering the fast spin rotation of the
   planet, the blueshift is best explained with the signal predominantly
   originating from the evening terminator and the presence of a strong
   dayside-to-nightside wind. The increased K-p over its expected value
   (196.5 km s(-1)) is, however, a bit puzzling. The signal is found to be
   broad, with a full width at half maximum of 16.8(-4.0)(+4.6) km s(-1).
   The retrieval results in a weak constraint on the mean temperature of
   2700-3700 K at the pressure range of the OH signal.
   Conclusions. We show that OH is readily observable in the transit
   spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters. Studying this molecule can provide
   insights into the molecular dissociation processes in the atmospheres of
   such planets.}},

  volume = {20},
  pages = {515-537},
  abstract = {{Recent studies have recognised highly oxygenated organic molecules
   (HOMs) in the atmosphere as important in the formation of secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA). A large number of studies have focused on HOM
   formation from oxidation of biogenically emitted monoterpenes. However,
   HOM formation from anthropogenic vapours has so far received much less
   attention. Previous studies have identified the importance of aromatic
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for SOA formation. In this study, we
   investigated several aromatic compounds, benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8),
   and naphthalene (C10H8), for their potential to form HOMs upon reaction
   with hydroxyl radicals (OH). We performed flow tube experiments with all
   three VOCs and focused in detail on benzene HOM formation in the Julich
   Plant Atmosphere Chamber (JPAC). In JPAC, we also investigated the
   response of HOMs to NOx and seed aerosol. Using a nitrate-based chemical
   ionisation mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF), we observed the formation of
   HOMs in the flow reactor oxidation of benzene from the first OH attack.
   However, in the oxidation of toluene and naphthalene, which were
   injected at lower concentrations, multi-generation OH oxidation seemed
   to impact the HOM composition. We tested this in more detail for the
   benzene system in the JPAC, which allowed for studying longer residence
   times. The results showed that the apparent molar benzene HOM yield
   under our experimental conditions varied from 4.1\% to 14.0\%, with a
   strong dependence on the OH concentration, indicating that the majority
   of observed HOMs formed through multiple OH-oxidation steps. The
   composition of the identified HOMs in the mass spectrum also supported
   this hypothesis. By injecting only phenol into the chamber, we found
   that phenol oxidation cannot be solely responsible for the observed HOMs
   in benzene experiments. When NOx was added to the chamber, HOM
   composition changed and many oxygenated nitrogen-containing products
   were observed in CI-APi-TOF. Upon seed aerosol injection, the HOM loss
   rate was higher than predicted by irreversible condensation, suggesting
   that some undetected oxygenated intermediates also condensed onto seed
   aerosol, which is in line with the hypothesis that some of the HOMs were
   formed in multi-generation OH oxidation. Based on our results, we
   conclude that HOM yield and composition in aromatic systems strongly
   depend on OH and VOC concentration and more studies are needed to fully
   understand this effect on the formation of HOMs and, consequently, SOA.
   We also suggest that the dependence of HOM yield on chamber conditions
   may explain part of the variability in SOA yields reported in the
   literature and strongly advise monitoring HOMs in future SOA studies.}},

   I-2 (-) pound, I-2 (2), (2)Delta, I-4 (-) pound, and I-4 ) of the OH
   radical have been studied using the multi-reference configuration
   interaction (MRCI) method where the Davidson correction, core-valence
   interaction and relativistic effect are considered with large basis sets
   of aug-cc-pv5z, aug-cc-pcv5z, and cc-pv5z-DK, respectively. Potential
   energy curves (PECs) and dipole moment functions are also calculated for
   these states for internuclear distances ranging from 0.05 nm to 0.80 nm.
   All possible vibrational levels and rotational constants for the bound
   state (XI)-I-2 and A(2)I (+) pound of OH are predicted by numerical
   solving the radial Schrodinger equation through the Level program, and
   spectroscopic parameters, which are in good agreements with experimental
   results, are obtained. Transition dipole moments between the ground
   state (XI)-I-2 and other excited states are also computed using MRCI,
   and the transition probability, lifetime, and Franck-Condon factors for
   the A(2)I (+)-(XI)-I-2 pound transition are discussed and compared with
   existing experimental values.},

The direct dissociation, following the excitation from the specific vibrational levels of the ground state X2Π to the repulsive state 12Σ- is examined, where the total and partial cross sections and the branching fractions of spin–orbit fine-structures of O(3PJ) are calculated over a wide range of the incident photon frequencies. For the predissociation via the bound excited state A2Σ+, the influence of the nonadiabatic interactions in different internuclear regions and the role of the repulsive states in the dissociation starting at different vibrational levels are also analyzed through the spin–orbit branching fractions of products. }

  abstract = { This paper describes a joint experimental and theoretical study of the photodissociation of vibrationally excited hydroxyl radicals. OH and OD radicals produced in a pulsed electric discharge supersonic beam are state-selected and focused by a hexapole and then photo-dissociated by a single laser tuned to various H/D or O atom (2 + 1) resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) wavelengths between 243 nm and 200 nm. The angle velocity distributions of the resulting O+ and D+ photofragment ions were recorded using velocity map imaging. Photodissociation to the O(3PJ) + H(2S) limit is shown to take place by one-photon excitation to the repulsive 1 2Σ− state. The experimental data shows that vibrationally excited OH/OD which are formed in the discharge are dissociated, and a vibrational temperature of ≈2000 K was estimated for the beam source. An analysis in the high-energy recoil sudden limit is used to predict the O(3PJ) fine structure branching ratios and alignment information in the molecular and laboratory velocity frame of the imaging experiment. The measured and predicted fine structure branching ratios and alignment parameters agree well at all dissociation wavelengths, supporting the model for photodissociation in the sudden limit regime. Several aspects of the experiment such as OH pre-alignment and orientation, ion-recoil, and Doppler-free imaging are discussed. }

  abstract = {{Context. Airglow emissions, such as previously observed from NO and
   O(2)(a - X) (0-0) on Venus, provide insight into the chemical and
   dynamical processes that control the composition and energy balance in
   the upper atmospheres of planets. The OH airglow emission has been
   observed previously only in the Earth's atmosphere where it has been
   used to infer atomic oxygen abundances. The O(2)(a - X) (0-1) airglow
   emission also has only been observed in the Earth's atmosphere, and
   neither laboratory nor theoretical studies have reached a consensus on
   its transition probability.
   Aims. We report measurements of night-side airglow emission in the
   atmosphere of Venus in the OH (2-0), OH (1-0), O(2)(a - X) (0-1), and
   O(2) (a - X) (0-0) bands. This is the first detection of the first three
   of these airglow emissions on another planet. These observations provide
   the most direct observational constraints to date on H, OH, and O(3),
   key species in the chemistry of Venus' upper atmosphere.
   Methods. Airglow emission detected at wavelengths of 1.40-1.49 and
   2.6-3.14 mu m in limb observations by the Visible and Infrared Thermal
   Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on the Venus Express spacecraft is
   attributed to the OH (2-0) and (1-0) transitions, respectively, and
   compared to calculations from a photochemical model. Simultaneous limb
   observations of airglow emission in the O(2)( a- X) (0-0) and (0-1)
   bands at 1.27 and 1.58 mu m, respectively, were used to derive the ratio
   of the transition probabilities for these bands.
   Results. The integrated emission rates for the OH (2-0) and (1-0) bands
   were measured to be 100 +/- 40 and 880 +/- 90 kR respectively, both
   peaking at an altitude of 96 +/- 2 km near midnight local time for the
   considered orbit. The measured ratio of the O(2)(a - X) (0-0) and (0-1)
   bands is 78 +/- 8.
   Conclusions. Photochemical model calculations suggest the observed OH
   emission is produced primarily via the Bates-Nicolet mechanism, as on
   the Earth. The observed ratio of the intensities of the O(2)(a - X)
   (0-0) and (0-1) bands implies the ratio of their transition
   probabilities is 63 +/- 6.}},

We show that the lifetime of the Rydberg Σ−2 states for rotationally cold molecules is limited mainly by predissociation caused by spin-orbit coupling.},

The branching ratios of O(3Pj, j=0,1,2) depend very sensitively on the vibrational levels (v=0–4) of the initial X2Π state. The variations of the spin–orbit distributions as a function of the excitation energy near the asymmetric resonances change markedly depending on the vibrational levels. The variations are either redshifted or blueshifted from the resonance position, depending on the degree of asymmetry of the resonances. The widths of the variations tend to increase with increasing vibrational quantum number of the initial state, suggesting the possibility of choosing the proper linewidths in the experiments to selectively produce the photofragments in one‐photon process. Discussion is presented on the applicability of the theoretical scheme to analyze the recent measurements by Neumark and co‐workers [J. Chem.

  abstract = {A quantum mechanical theory is described for diatomic photodissociation processes to atomic fine structure states for which more than one atomic term limit must be explicitly considered. The theory is employed to treat the photodissociation of OH molecule. Two frame transformation matrices are constructed and incorporated, for the first time, to describe the correlations between two oxygen terms [O(3P) and O(1D)] and the adiabatic Born–Oppenheimer states. We find that very interesting dynamics results from the quantum interferences between electronic states. Near the dissociation threshold to O(3P), asymptotic interactions between asymptotically degenerate states correlating to O(3P) term are shown to manifest as multichannel resonances. At energies between thresholds to O(3P) and O(1D) terms, quantum interferences between A2Σ+ and 2Σ− states are predicted to result in asymmetric resonances. Partial cross sections to the triplet oxygen fine structure states O(3Pj, j=0,1,2) exhibit different degrees of asymmetry due to the combined effects of the quantum interference between A2Σ+ and 2Σ− states crossing in the Franck–Condon region, and the asymptotic interactions among 4Σ−, 2Σ−, and 4Π states correlating to O(3P). Consequently, the branching ratios of O(3Pj, j=0,1,2) exhibit strong variations across the asymmetric resonances, suggesting the possibility of controlling the product distributions by tuning at the excitation wavelengths across a single asymmetric resonance in one‐photon process. Interference between the dissociative 2Δ and 22Π states, correlating with O(1D) term, are shown to give rise to highly oscillatory variations of the dissociation cross sections to O(1D) at energies above the threshold to O(1D).},

For v′ = 1−3, there is a general agreement between experiment and theory but for v′ = 4, the difference is substantial. For v′ = 5−7, there are no experimental results available.

Nonadiabatic effects are found to be very strong for the lower predissociative vibrational A2Σ+ levels and to remain nonnegligible even for the higher vibrational states of A2Σ+ despite the considerable degree to which the asymptotic fragment kinetic energy exceeds the oxygen atom fine structure splittings. Nonadiabatic effects generally increase in importance with the final total angular momentum J of the A2Σ+ state because of the increased Coriolis couplings, but the spin sublevel and parity are of minor importance except at low energies. The oxygen atom fine structure branching ratios are shown to provide a qualitative probe of the predissociation pathway. Certain conditions are presented under which a good approximation to the branching ratios can be obtained by simple analytical treatments without the necessity of performing multichannel scattering calculations.},

  abstract = {The bound 32Π and repulsive 22Π states of OH are strongly coupled by the action of the nuclear kinetic energy operator. The process of photodissociation by absorption into the coupled 2Π states is studied theoretically. The adiabatic electronic eigenfunctions and potential energy curves of the 22Π and 32Π states are calculated using large configuration‐interaction (CI) representations and the nuclear radial coupling matrix elements are obtained by numerical differentiation. The coupled equations for the nuclear wave functions of the two states are set up in an adiabatic and in a diabatic formulation and are solved by numerical integration. The electric dipole transition moments connecting the ground X2Π state to the 22Π and 32Π states are computed from the CI wave functions and the resulting photodissociation cross sections of OH arising from absorption into the coupled 22Π and 32Π states are obtained. Two alternative sets of potential curves, coupling matrix elements, and transition moments are employed to provide an assessment of the accuracy of the results. The photodissociation cross section shows a series of resonances superimposed on a broad continuous background. The resonances are located near to the vibrational levels of the uncoupled bound diabatic potential curve. They have asymmetric Beutler–Fano profiles and vary in width from 50 cm−1 for the lowest levels to 2 cm−1 for the higher levels. The accuracy of adiabatic and diabatic approximations, carried to first order in the coupling, is explored and it is demonstrated that the diabatic approximation provides a more satisfactory representation of the photodissociation process. The discrete‐continuum configuration interaction theory of Fano is applied in the diabatic formulation and the resonance structures are calculated. The discrete‐continuum interaction theory yields profile parameters and level shifts which agree well with the accurate values obtained by solving the coupled equations but its application is considerably more laborious. The contribution of absorption into the coupled 2Π states to the interstellar photodissociation rate is evaluated. In the optically thin limit, the rate is1.5×10−10 s−1. The total rate is 4×10−10 s−1.},

  abstract = {A systematic investigation of the excited states that may participate in the photodissociation of the OH molecule has been carried out by ab initio calculations which use two different self‐consistent field with configuration‐interaction methods. Potential energy curves for states of 2Σ+, 2Σ−, 2Π, and 2Δ symmetries have been computed and the transition dipole moments connecting the states have been obtained. Photodissociation cross sections for absorption from the v″=0 vibrational level of the ground X2Π state into the repulsive 12Δ, B2Σ+, and 22Π states are reported. It is shown that the 12Δ and B2Σ+ states, together with the 12Σ− state considered in an earlier study, are important channels for photodissociation. Photodissociation may take place also following absorption into bound electronic states and absorption oscillator strengths for these transitions have been determined. The mechanisms by which the bound states can be dissociated are discussed and estimates of the dissociation efficiencies of the mechanisms are made. Absorption into the bound 32Π state may be an important dissociation channel. Calculations of the interstellar photodissociation rate have assumed that photodissociation proceeds by absorption into the C2Σ+ state for which a large oscillator strength had been adopted. We find that the C2Σ+ channel is not significant in photodissociation and we present new estimates of the interstellar photodissociation rates. Our calculations demonstrate that OH is dissociated by the absorption of Lyman alpha radiation, a channel of particular significance in shocked interstellar gas and in cometary atmospheres.},

   the reaction H $+$ O3 {\textrightarrow} OH $+$ O2 forms OH predominantly in the
   highest accessible vibrational levels, v $=$ 8 and 9. We have extended this earlier
   work (1) by using fourier transform spectroscopy which is capable of giving more
   precise values for the relative vibrational populations at low intensities, (2)
   by recording emission down to lower background pressures (1 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}4 Torr),
   and (3) by treating the vessel walls so as to remove OH† (vibrationally excited
   OH in it ground 2$\Pi$ electronic state) more effectively. This involved using a
   room temperature vessel coated with silica gel. Under these conditions (provided
   that the values available for the radiational lifetime of OH† are correct) vibrational
   relaxation of OH† should have been largely arrested. We conclude that the relative
   rate constants for formation of OH† in levels v are k(v $=$ 6) \&lt; 0.4, k(v $=$ 7) $\approx$ 0.4,
   k(v $=$ 8) $\approx$ 0.8, and k(v $=$ 9) $=$ 1.00.},
