   the OH radical}},
Journal =PRA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{103}},
Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study of photoionization of OH radicals from
   the ground and first excited electronic states. Cross sections and
   asymmetry parameters for the valence orbitals are reported for photon
   energies from near the threshold to 60 eV. The calculations have been
   performed with the R-matrix method. Two different continuum basis types,
   namely, the Gaussian and B-spline bases, are used to assess the quality
   of the description of the continuum. The results show both types of
   continuum bases provide a similar quality description in the near
   threshold resonant region, but the latter can predict more reliable
   photoionization observables in higher-energy regions. Our calculations
   are compared with available experimental and theoretical results, and
   the discussions are provided.}},

Title = {{A Comparison of Einstein A Coefficients for OH Rotational Temperature
   Measurements Using a Large Astronomical Data Set}},
Journal = {Atmosphere},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{The Einstein A coefficients are considered to be a significant source of
   uncertainty in the measurement of OH rotational temperatures. Using
   simultaneous ground and spaced-based observations of OH emission, five
   sets of Einstein A coefficients were examined for their impact upon
   rotational temperature calculations. The ground-based observations are
   taken from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
   (APOGEE) instrument which is a high resolution, r = lambda/Delta lambda
   >= 20, 000, spectrograph operating in the H-band from approximately 1.5
   to 1.7 mu m. APOGEE collected over one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand
   spectra of the night sky over a period from June 2011 to June 2013. The
   Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER)
   instrument on board the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics
   and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite has made simultaneous atmospheric
   measurements with the APOGEE spectrograph. SABER observes the OH volume
   emission rate (VER) around 1.6 mu m, providing measurements coincident
   with those of the OH emission in the APOGEE sky spectra. Four of the
   five sets of Einstein A coefficients tested yielded statistically
   identical mean rotational temperatures of approximately 195 K for the
   OH(4 - 2) transition. The Einstein A coefficients were found to have a
   significant impact upon the measured OH (v' = 4) vibrational populations
   with some sets of coefficients yielding populations over 50\% greater.
   Simultaneous SABER observations were used to determine which set of
   Einstein A coefficients best reflected atmospheric temperatures, and
   four of the five tested coefficients yielded nearly identical results.
   The difference between OH rotational temperatures and SABER temperatures
   was on average 1 K.}},

Title = {{Airglow Derived Measurements of Q-Branch Transition Probabilities for
   Several Hydroxyl Meinel Bands}},
Journal = {Atmosphere},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Spectroscopic measurements of the hydroxyl (OH) airglow emissions are
   often used to infer neutral temperatures near the mesopause. Correct
   Einstein coefficients for the various transitions in the OH airglow are
   needed to calculate accurate temperatures. However, studies showed
   experimentally and theoretically that the most commonly used Einstein
   spontaneous emission transition probabilities for the Q-branch of the OH
   Meinel (6,2) transition are overestimated. Extending their work to
   several Delta v = 2 and 3 transitions from v' = 3 to 9, we have
   determined Einstein coefficients for the first four Q-branch rotational
   lines. These have been derived from high resolution, high signal to
   noise spectroscopic observations of the OH airglow in the night sky from
   the Nordic Optical Telescope. The Q-branch Einstein coefficients
   calculated from these spectra show that values currently tabulated in
   the HITRAN database overestimate many of the Q-branch transition
   probabilities. The implications for atmospheric temperatures derived
   from OH Q-branch measurements are discussed.}},

All possible transitions are included with v â€² and v â€³ up to 13, and J up to between 9.5 and 59.5, depending on the band. An updated fit to determine molecular constants has been performed, which includes some new rotational data and a simultaneous fitting of all molecular constants. The absolute transition strengths are based on a new dipole moment function, which is a combination of two high level ab initio calculations. The calculations show good agreement with an experimental v = 1 lifetime, experimental Î¼ v values, and Î”v=2 line intensity ratios from an observed spectrum. To achieve this good agreement, an alteration in the method of converting matrix elements from Hund×³s case (b) to (a) was made. Partitions sums have been calculated using the new energy levels, for the temperature range 5â€“6000 K, which extends the previously available (in HITRAN) 70â€“3000 K range. The resulting absolute transition strengths have been used to calculate O abundances in the Sun, Arcturus, and two red giants in the Galactic open and globular clusters \{M67\} and M71. Literature data based mainly on [O I] lines are available for the Sun and Arcturus, and excellent agreement is found. "

   parameters based on two methods: (a) spectroscopic parameters and (b)
   infrared flux method (IRFM) effective temperatures, trigonometric
   gravities, and metallicities from Fe II lines. The Fe I lines present in
   the H-band region observed were well fitted by the stellar parameters
   within A{[}Fe/H] less than or equal to 0.15 dex. The oxygen abundances
   were derived from fits of spectrum synthesis calculations to the

This involved using a room temperature vessel coated with silica gel. Under these conditions (provided that the values available for the radiational lifetime of OH† are correct) vibrational relaxation of OH† should have been largely arrested. We conclude that the relative rate constants for formation of OH† in levels v are k(v $=$ 6) \&lt; 0.4, k(v $=$ 7) $\approx$ 0.4, k(v $=$ 8) $\approx$ 0.8, and k(v $=$ 9) $=$ 1.00.},
