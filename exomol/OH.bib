   abstract={Context. Water photodissociation in the 114–143 nm UV range
   forms excited OH which emits at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths via 
   highly excited rotational lines. These lines have only been detected
   with Spitzer in proto-planetary disks and shocks. Previous studies 
   have shown that they are a unique diagnostic for water photodissociation. 
   Thanks to its high sensitivity and angular resolution, the James Webb 
   Space Telescope (JWST) could be able to detect them in other environments 
   such as interstellar photodissociation regions (PDRs).
   Aims. Our goal is to predict OH MIR lines for a large range of 
   thermal pressures and UV fields in PDRs.
   Methods. We use the Meudon PDR Code to compute the thermal and 
   chemical structure of PDRs. In order to predict the emerging spectrum of OH, 
   we amended the code to include prompt emission induced by H2O photodissociation 
   between 114 and 143 nm. We performed a detailed study of the influence 
   of thermal pressure (Pth/k = nHTK) and UV field strength on the integrated 
   intensities and their detectability with the JWST.
   Results. OH MIR emission is predicted to originate very close to the H0/H2 
   transition and is directly proportional to the column density of water 
   photodissociated in that layer. Because gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions 
   forming water require relatively high temperatures (TK ≳ 300 K), the resulting 
   OH MIR lines are primarily correlated with the temperature at this position, and 
   are therefore brighter in regions with high pressure. This implies that these lines 
   are predicted to be only detectable in strongly irradiated PDRs (G0incident > 103) 
   with high thermal pressure (Pth/k ≳ 5x107 K cm–3). In the latter case, OH MIR lines 
   are less dependent on the strength of the incident UV field. The detection of such 
   lines in PDRs such as the Orion bar – which should be possible – is also 
   investigated and we show that the line-to-continuum ratio could be a major 
   limitation for detection because of instrumental limitations.
   Conclusions. OH MIR lines observable by JWST are a promising diagnostic for dense 
   and strongly irradiated PDRs and proplyds. Their intensities are directly 
   proportional to the amount of water photodissociated and they are therefore 
   an indirect but sensitive probe of the gas temperature at the H0/H2 transition.}

Title = {{Detection of OH in the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{656}},
Abstract = {{Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures at which most
   molecules are expected to thermally dissociate. The dissociation of
   water vapour results in the production of the hydroxyl radical (OH).
   While OH absorption is easily observed in near-infrared spectra of M
   dwarfs, which have similar effective temperatures as ultra-hot Jupiters,
   it is often not considered when studying the atmospheres of ultra-hot
   Jupiters. Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy during the primary
   transit is a powerful tool for detecting molecular absorption in these
   planets.
   Aims. We aim to assess the presence and detectability of OH in the
   atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b.
   Methods. We use high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a transit
   of WASP-76b obtained using CARMENES. After validating the OH line list,
   we generate model transit spectra of WASP-76b with petitRADTRANS. The
   data are corrected for stellar and telluric contamination and
   cross-correlated with the model spectra. After combining all
   cross-correlation functions from the transit, a detection map is
   constructed. Constraints on the planet properties from the OH absorption
   are obtained from a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.
   Results. OH is detected in the atmosphere of WASP-76b with a peak
   signal-to-noise ratio of 6.1. From the retrieval we obtain K-p = 232 +/-
   12 km s(-1) and a blueshift of - 13.2 +/- 1.6 km s(-1), which are offset
   from the expected velocities. Considering the fast spin rotation of the
   planet, the blueshift is best explained with the signal predominantly
   originating from the evening terminator and the presence of a strong
   dayside-to-nightside wind. The increased K-p over its expected value
   (196.5 km s(-1)) is, however, a bit puzzling. The signal is found to be
   broad, with a full width at half maximum of 16.8(-4.0)(+4.6) km s(-1).
   The retrieval results in a weak constraint on the mean temperature of
   2700-3700 K at the pressure range of the OH signal.
   Conclusions. We show that OH is readily observable in the transit
   spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters. Studying this molecule can provide
   insights into the molecular dissociation processes in the atmospheres of
   such planets.}},

   common for intensity ratios of both OH main lines and satellite lines.
   Line intensity of OH 1667 MHz is found to correlate linearly with visual
   extinction sigma uncertainty. The relationship between OH abundance
   X(OH) relative to H-2 and A(V) is found to follow an empirical formula,

   6.3(0.5)(+0.5) x exp (-A(V)/2.9(-0.6)(+0.6)). Linear correlation is
   found between OH and (CO)-C-13 intensity. Besides, nonthermal velocity
   dispersions of OH and (CO)-C-13 are closely correlated. These results
   imply tight chemical evolution and spatial occupation between OH and
   (CO)-C-13. No obvious correlation is found between column density and
   nonthermal velocity dispersion of OH and H i narrow self-absorption
   (HINSA), indicating different chemical evolution and spatial volume
   occupation between OH and HINSA. Using the age information of HINSA
   analysis, OH abundance X(OH) is found to increase linearly with cloud
   age, which is consistent with previous simulations. Fourteen OH
   components without corresponding CO emission were detected, implying the

Abstract = {{Water ice, abundant in the outer solar system, is volatile in the inner
   solar system. On the largest airless bodies of the inner solar system
   (Mercury, the Moon, Ceres), water can be an exospheric species but also
   occurs in its condensed form. Mercury hosts water ice deposits in
   permanently shadowed regions near its poles that act as cold traps.
   Water ice is also present on the Moon, where these polar deposits are of
   great interest in the context of future lunar exploration. The lunar
   surface releases either OH or H2O during meteoroid showers, and both of
   these species are generated by reaction of implanted solar wind protons
   with metal oxides in the regolith. A consequence of the ongoing
   interaction between the solar wind and the surface is a surficial
   hydroxyl population that has been observed on the Moon. Dwarf planet
   Ceres has enough gravity to have a gravitationally-bound water
   exosphere, and also has permanently shadowed regions near its poles,
   with bright ice deposits found in the most long-lived of its cold traps.
   Tantalizing evidence for cold trapped water ice and exospheres of
   molecular water has emerged, but even basic questions remain open. The
   relative and absolute magnitudes of sources of water on Mercury and the
   Moon remain largely unknown. Exospheres can transport water to cold
   traps, but the efficiency of this process remains uncertain. Here, the
   status of observations, theory, and laboratory measurements is reviewed.}},

Title = {{Multi-generation OH oxidation as a source for highly oxygenated organic
   molecules from aromatics}},
Journal = ACP,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{515-537}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have recognised highly oxygenated organic molecules
   (HOMs) in the atmosphere as important in the formation of secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA). A large number of studies have focused on HOM
   formation from oxidation of biogenically emitted monoterpenes. However,
   HOM formation from anthropogenic vapours has so far received much less
   attention. Previous studies have identified the importance of aromatic
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for SOA formation. In this study, we
   investigated several aromatic compounds, benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8),
   and naphthalene (C10H8), for their potential to form HOMs upon reaction
   with hydroxyl radicals (OH). We performed flow tube experiments with all
   three VOCs and focused in detail on benzene HOM formation in the Julich
   Plant Atmosphere Chamber (JPAC). In JPAC, we also investigated the
   response of HOMs to NOx and seed aerosol. Using a nitrate-based chemical
   ionisation mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF), we observed the formation of
   HOMs in the flow reactor oxidation of benzene from the first OH attack.
   However, in the oxidation of toluene and naphthalene, which were
   injected at lower concentrations, multi-generation OH oxidation seemed
   to impact the HOM composition. We tested this in more detail for the
   benzene system in the JPAC, which allowed for studying longer residence
   times. The results showed that the apparent molar benzene HOM yield
   under our experimental conditions varied from 4.1\% to 14.0\%, with a
   strong dependence on the OH concentration, indicating that the majority
   of observed HOMs formed through multiple OH-oxidation steps. The
   composition of the identified HOMs in the mass spectrum also supported
   this hypothesis. By injecting only phenol into the chamber, we found
   that phenol oxidation cannot be solely responsible for the observed HOMs
   in benzene experiments. When NOx was added to the chamber, HOM
   composition changed and many oxygenated nitrogen-containing products
   were observed in CI-APi-TOF. Upon seed aerosol injection, the HOM loss
   rate was higher than predicted by irreversible condensation, suggesting
   that some undetected oxygenated intermediates also condensed onto seed
   aerosol, which is in line with the hypothesis that some of the HOMs were
   formed in multi-generation OH oxidation. Based on our results, we
   conclude that HOM yield and composition in aromatic systems strongly
   depend on OH and VOC concentration and more studies are needed to fully
   understand this effect on the formation of HOMs and, consequently, SOA.
   We also suggest that the dependence of HOM yield on chamber conditions
   may explain part of the variability in SOA yields reported in the
   literature and strongly advise monitoring HOMs in future SOA studies.}},

Abstract = {Potential energy functions of the OH molecule are investigated from

   approach that avoids orbital jumps found usually in multi-configuration
   self-consistent-field followed by multi-reference configuration
   interaction calculations of excited states. The calculations are
   performed for all the doublet, quartet, and sextet OH molecular states,
   up to the O(2p(3)4s S-3) + H(1s S-2) asymptote, and for the lowest O- +
   H+ and O+ + H- ionic states. Inter-atomic distances, ranging from 0.5
   angstrom to 20 angstrom, are spanned with a very small step in order to
   describe accurately the avoided crossings between the adiabatic
   potential energy functions. The accuracy of the potentials at small and
   large R values is analyzed. These Full CI calculations provide for the
   first time a global description of the 40 lowest molecular states of OH,
   well suited for dynamical calculations. The resulting potentials are
   used to obtain first estimates of cross sections and rate coefficients
   for different inelastic processes through the multichannel approach.
   This method, based on a Landau-Zener formalism taking into account the
   ionic-covalent avoided crossings at large distances, gives reliable
   results for the most intense transitions. It is shown that the largest
   rate coefficients correspond to mutual neutralization and ion-pair

   are performed for the collision energy range 0.01-100eV and the
   temperature range 1000-10000K. The mechanisms underlying the processes
   are analysed: it is shown that the largest rate coefficients, with
   values exceeding 10(-8)cm(3)s(-1), are due to ionic-covalent
   interactions present at large internuclear distances, while short-range
   interactions play an important role for rates with moderate values

   the present data with previously published results shows that
   differences of up to several orders of magnitude exist for rate
   coefficients with moderate values. It is worth pointing out the
   relatively large rate coefficients for triplet-quintuplet oxygen
   transitions, as well as for transitions between the OSo) and OP) levels
   of the oxygen triplet and H(n= 2) levels. The calculated data are
   important for modelling stellar spectra, leading to accurate oxygen

   I-2 (-) pound, I-2 (2), (2)Delta, I-4 (-) pound, and I-4 ) of the OH
   radical have been studied using the multi-reference configuration
   interaction (MRCI) method where the Davidson correction, core-valence
   interaction and relativistic effect are considered with large basis sets
   of aug-cc-pv5z, aug-cc-pcv5z, and cc-pv5z-DK, respectively. Potential
   energy curves (PECs) and dipole moment functions are also calculated for
   these states for internuclear distances ranging from 0.05 nm to 0.80 nm.
   All possible vibrational levels and rotational constants for the bound
   state (XI)-I-2 and A(2)I (+) pound of OH are predicted by numerical
   solving the radial Schrodinger equation through the Level program, and
   spectroscopic parameters, which are in good agreements with experimental
   results, are obtained. Transition dipole moments between the ground
   state (XI)-I-2 and other excited states are also computed using MRCI,
   and the transition probability, lifetime, and Franck-Condon factors for
   the A(2)I (+)-(XI)-I-2 pound transition are discussed and compared with
   existing experimental values.},

Title = {{First detection of hydroxyl in the atmosphere of Venus}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{483}},
Pages = {L29-L33},
Abstract = {{Context. Airglow emissions, such as previously observed from NO and
   O(2)(a - X) (0-0) on Venus, provide insight into the chemical and
   dynamical processes that control the composition and energy balance in
   the upper atmospheres of planets. The OH airglow emission has been
   observed previously only in the Earth's atmosphere where it has been
   used to infer atomic oxygen abundances. The O(2)(a - X) (0-1) airglow
   emission also has only been observed in the Earth's atmosphere, and
   neither laboratory nor theoretical studies have reached a consensus on
   its transition probability.
   Aims. We report measurements of night-side airglow emission in the
   atmosphere of Venus in the OH (2-0), OH (1-0), O(2)(a - X) (0-1), and
   O(2) (a - X) (0-0) bands. This is the first detection of the first three
   of these airglow emissions on another planet. These observations provide
   the most direct observational constraints to date on H, OH, and O(3),
   key species in the chemistry of Venus' upper atmosphere.
   Methods. Airglow emission detected at wavelengths of 1.40-1.49 and
   2.6-3.14 mu m in limb observations by the Visible and Infrared Thermal
   Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on the Venus Express spacecraft is
   attributed to the OH (2-0) and (1-0) transitions, respectively, and
   compared to calculations from a photochemical model. Simultaneous limb
   observations of airglow emission in the O(2)( a- X) (0-0) and (0-1)
   bands at 1.27 and 1.58 mu m, respectively, were used to derive the ratio
   of the transition probabilities for these bands.
   Results. The integrated emission rates for the OH (2-0) and (1-0) bands
   were measured to be 100 +/- 40 and 880 +/- 90 kR respectively, both
   peaking at an altitude of 96 +/- 2 km near midnight local time for the
   considered orbit. The measured ratio of the O(2)(a - X) (0-0) and (0-1)
   bands is 78 +/- 8.
   Conclusions. Photochemical model calculations suggest the observed OH
   emission is produced primarily via the Bates-Nicolet mechanism, as on
   the Earth. The observed ratio of the intensities of the O(2)(a - X)
   (0-0) and (0-1) bands implies the ratio of their transition
   probabilities is 63 +/- 6.}},

   (1985) of two pairs of lines from the infrared (2, 0) band with Stokes V
   profiles exhibiting opposite polarities. Our new perturbation
   calculations of the Zeeman effect in diatomic molecules, which allow
   states of any multiplicity to be treated, resolve the puzzle. They
   reveal that the unusual behaviour of these lines stems from the fact
   that the two pairs have effective Lande factors of similar magnitude,

Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {Infrared OH lines at 1.55-1.56 mum in the H band were obtained with the
   Phoenix high-resolution spectrograph at the 2.1 m telescope of the Kitt
   Peak National Observatory for a sample of 14 metal-poor stars. Detailed
   analyses of the sample stars have been carried out, deriving stellar
   parameters based on two methods: (a) spectroscopic parameters and (b)
   infrared flux method (IRFM) effective temperatures, trigonometric
   gravities, and metallicities from Fe II lines. The Fe I lines present in
   the H-band region observed were well fitted by the stellar parameters
   within A{[}Fe/H] less than or equal to 0.15 dex. The oxygen abundances
   were derived from fits of spectrum synthesis calculations to the
   infrared OH lines. CO lines in the H and K bands were obtained for a
   subsample in order to determine their carbon abundances. Adopting the
   spectroscopic parameters, a mean oxygen-to-iron ratio of {[}O/Fe]
   approximate to 0.52 is obtained, whereas using the IRFM temperatures,
   Hipparcos gravities, and {[}Fe II/H], {[}O/Fe] approximate to 0.25 is
   found. A mean of the two methods gives a final value of {[}O/Fe]
   approximate to 0.4 for the metallicity range -2.2 < {[}Fe/H] < -1.2 of
   the sample metal-poor stars.},

the reaction H $+$ O3 {\textrightarrow} OH $+$ O2 forms OH predominantly in the
highest accessible vibrational levels, v $=$ 8 and 9. We have extended this earlier
work (1) by using fourier transform spectroscopy which is capable of giving more
precise values for the relative vibrational populations at low intensities, (2)
by recording emission down to lower background pressures (1 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}4 Torr),
and (3) by treating the vessel walls so as to remove OH† (vibrationally excited
OH in it ground 2$\Pi$ electronic state) more effectively. This involved using a
room temperature vessel coated with silica gel. Under these conditions (provided
that the values available for the radiational lifetime of OH† are correct) vibrational
relaxation of OH† should have been largely arrested. We conclude that the relative
rate constants for formation of OH† in levels v are k(v $=$ 6) \&lt; 0.4, k(v $=$ 7) $\approx$ 0.4,
k(v $=$ 8) $\approx$ 0.8, and k(v $=$ 9) $=$ 1.00.},
