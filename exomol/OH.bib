   abstract={Context. Water photodissociation in the 114–143 nm UV range
   forms excited OH which emits at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths via 
   highly excited rotational lines. These lines have only been detected
   with Spitzer in proto-planetary disks and shocks. Previous studies 
   have shown that they are a unique diagnostic for water photodissociation. 
   Thanks to its high sensitivity and angular resolution, the James Webb 
   Space Telescope (JWST) could be able to detect them in other environments 
   such as interstellar photodissociation regions (PDRs).
   Aims. Our goal is to predict OH MIR lines for a large range of 
   thermal pressures and UV fields in PDRs.
   Methods. We use the Meudon PDR Code to compute the thermal and 
   chemical structure of PDRs. In order to predict the emerging spectrum of OH, 
   we amended the code to include prompt emission induced by H2O photodissociation 
   between 114 and 143 nm. We performed a detailed study of the influence 
   of thermal pressure (Pth/k = nHTK) and UV field strength on the integrated 
   intensities and their detectability with the JWST.
   Results. OH MIR emission is predicted to originate very close to the H0/H2 
   transition and is directly proportional to the column density of water 
   photodissociated in that layer. Because gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions 
   forming water require relatively high temperatures (TK ≳ 300 K), the resulting 
   OH MIR lines are primarily correlated with the temperature at this position, and 
   are therefore brighter in regions with high pressure. This implies that these lines 
   are predicted to be only detectable in strongly irradiated PDRs (G0incident > 103) 
   with high thermal pressure (Pth/k ≳ 5x107 K cm–3). In the latter case, OH MIR lines 
   are less dependent on the strength of the incident UV field. The detection of such 
   lines in PDRs such as the Orion bar – which should be possible – is also 
   investigated and we show that the line-to-continuum ratio could be a major 
   limitation for detection because of instrumental limitations.
   Conclusions. OH MIR lines observable by JWST are a promising diagnostic for dense 
   and strongly irradiated PDRs and proplyds. Their intensities are directly 
   proportional to the amount of water photodissociated and they are therefore 
   an indirect but sensitive probe of the gas temperature at the H0/H2 transition.}

Title = {{Detection of OH in the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{656}},
Abstract = {{Context. Ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures at which most
   molecules are expected to thermally dissociate. The dissociation of
   water vapour results in the production of the hydroxyl radical (OH).
   While OH absorption is easily observed in near-infrared spectra of M
   dwarfs, which have similar effective temperatures as ultra-hot Jupiters,
   it is often not considered when studying the atmospheres of ultra-hot
   Jupiters. Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy during the primary
   transit is a powerful tool for detecting molecular absorption in these
   planets.
   Aims. We aim to assess the presence and detectability of OH in the
   atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b.
   Methods. We use high-resolution spectroscopic observations of a transit
   of WASP-76b obtained using CARMENES. After validating the OH line list,
   we generate model transit spectra of WASP-76b with petitRADTRANS. The
   data are corrected for stellar and telluric contamination and
   cross-correlated with the model spectra. After combining all
   cross-correlation functions from the transit, a detection map is
   constructed. Constraints on the planet properties from the OH absorption
   are obtained from a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.
   Results. OH is detected in the atmosphere of WASP-76b with a peak
   signal-to-noise ratio of 6.1. From the retrieval we obtain K-p = 232 +/-
   12 km s(-1) and a blueshift of - 13.2 +/- 1.6 km s(-1), which are offset
   from the expected velocities. Considering the fast spin rotation of the
   planet, the blueshift is best explained with the signal predominantly
   originating from the evening terminator and the presence of a strong
   dayside-to-nightside wind. The increased K-p over its expected value
   (196.5 km s(-1)) is, however, a bit puzzling. The signal is found to be
   broad, with a full width at half maximum of 16.8(-4.0)(+4.6) km s(-1).
   The retrieval results in a weak constraint on the mean temperature of
   2700-3700 K at the pressure range of the OH signal.
   Conclusions. We show that OH is readily observable in the transit
   spectra of ultra-hot Jupiters. Studying this molecule can provide
   insights into the molecular dissociation processes in the atmospheres of
   such planets.}},

   common for intensity ratios of both OH main lines and satellite lines.
   Line intensity of OH 1667 MHz is found to correlate linearly with visual

Abstract = {{Water ice, abundant in the outer solar system, is volatile in the inner
   solar system. On the largest airless bodies of the inner solar system

   occurs in its condensed form. Mercury hosts water ice deposits in
   permanently shadowed regions near its poles that act as cold traps.
   Water ice is also present on the Moon, where these polar deposits are of
   great interest in the context of future lunar exploration. The lunar
   surface releases either OH or H2O during meteoroid showers, and both of
   these species are generated by reaction of implanted solar wind protons
   with metal oxides in the regolith. A consequence of the ongoing
   interaction between the solar wind and the surface is a surficial
   hydroxyl population that has been observed on the Moon. Dwarf planet
   Ceres has enough gravity to have a gravitationally-bound water
   exosphere, and also has permanently shadowed regions near its poles,
   with bright ice deposits found in the most long-lived of its cold traps.
   Tantalizing evidence for cold trapped water ice and exospheres of
   molecular water has emerged, but even basic questions remain open. The
   relative and absolute magnitudes of sources of water on Mercury and the

Title = {{Multi-generation OH oxidation as a source for highly oxygenated organic
   molecules from aromatics}},
Journal = ACP,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{515-537}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have recognised highly oxygenated organic molecules
   (HOMs) in the atmosphere as important in the formation of secondary
   organic aerosol (SOA). A large number of studies have focused on HOM
   formation from oxidation of biogenically emitted monoterpenes. However,
   HOM formation from anthropogenic vapours has so far received much less
   attention. Previous studies have identified the importance of aromatic
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for SOA formation. In this study, we
   investigated several aromatic compounds, benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8),
   and naphthalene (C10H8), for their potential to form HOMs upon reaction
   with hydroxyl radicals (OH). We performed flow tube experiments with all
   three VOCs and focused in detail on benzene HOM formation in the Julich
   Plant Atmosphere Chamber (JPAC). In JPAC, we also investigated the
   response of HOMs to NOx and seed aerosol. Using a nitrate-based chemical
   ionisation mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF), we observed the formation of
   HOMs in the flow reactor oxidation of benzene from the first OH attack.
   However, in the oxidation of toluene and naphthalene, which were
   injected at lower concentrations, multi-generation OH oxidation seemed
   to impact the HOM composition. We tested this in more detail for the
   benzene system in the JPAC, which allowed for studying longer residence
   times. The results showed that the apparent molar benzene HOM yield
   under our experimental conditions varied from 4.1\% to 14.0\%, with a
   strong dependence on the OH concentration, indicating that the majority
   of observed HOMs formed through multiple OH-oxidation steps. The
   composition of the identified HOMs in the mass spectrum also supported
   this hypothesis. By injecting only phenol into the chamber, we found
   that phenol oxidation cannot be solely responsible for the observed HOMs
   in benzene experiments. When NOx was added to the chamber, HOM
   composition changed and many oxygenated nitrogen-containing products
   were observed in CI-APi-TOF. Upon seed aerosol injection, the HOM loss
   rate was higher than predicted by irreversible condensation, suggesting
   that some undetected oxygenated intermediates also condensed onto seed
   aerosol, which is in line with the hypothesis that some of the HOMs were
   formed in multi-generation OH oxidation. Based on our results, we
   conclude that HOM yield and composition in aromatic systems strongly
   depend on OH and VOC concentration and more studies are needed to fully
   understand this effect on the formation of HOMs and, consequently, SOA.
   We also suggest that the dependence of HOM yield on chamber conditions
   may explain part of the variability in SOA yields reported in the
   literature and strongly advise monitoring HOMs in future SOA studies.}},

   interaction calculations of excited states. The calculations are
   performed for all the doublet, quartet, and sextet OH molecular states,
   up to the O(2p(3)4s S-3) + H(1s S-2) asymptote, and for the lowest O- +
   H+ and O+ + H- ionic states. Inter-atomic distances, ranging from 0.5
   angstrom to 20 angstrom, are spanned with a very small step in order to
   describe accurately the avoided crossings between the adiabatic
   potential energy functions. The accuracy of the potentials at small and
   large R values is analyzed. These Full CI calculations provide for the
   first time a global description of the 40 lowest molecular states of OH,
   well suited for dynamical calculations. The resulting potentials are
   used to obtain first estimates of cross sections and rate coefficients
   for different inelastic processes through the multichannel approach.
   This method, based on a Landau-Zener formalism taking into account the

Abstract = {Spectroscopic measurements of the hydroxyl (OH) airglow emissions are
   often used to infer neutral temperatures near the mesopause. Correct
   Einstein coefficients for the various transitions in the OH airglow are
   needed to calculate accurate temperatures. However, studies showed
   experimentally and theoretically that the most commonly used Einstein
   spontaneous emission transition probabilities for the Q-branch of the OH
   Meinel (6,2) transition are overestimated. Extending their work to
   several Delta v = 2 and 3 transitions from v' = 3 to 9, we have
   determined Einstein coefficients for the first four Q-branch rotational
   lines. These have been derived from high resolution, high signal to
   noise spectroscopic observations of the OH airglow in the night sky from
   the Nordic Optical Telescope. The Q-branch Einstein coefficients
   calculated from these spectra show that values currently tabulated in
   the HITRAN database overestimate many of the Q-branch transition
   probabilities. The implications for atmospheric temperatures derived
   from OH Q-branch measurements are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract A new line list including positions and absolute transition
strengths (in the form of Einstein A values and oscillator strengths) has been
produced for the \{OH\} ground X 2 Î  state rovibrational (Meinel system) and pure
rotational transitions. All possible transitions are included with v â€² and v â€³
up to 13, and J up to between 9.5 and 59.5, depending on the band. An updated fit
to determine molecular constants has been performed, which includes some new
rotational data and a simultaneous fitting of all molecular constants. The absolute
transition strengths are based on a new dipole moment function, which is a combination
of two high level ab initio calculations. The calculations show good agreement with
an experimental v = 1 lifetime, experimental Î¼ v values, and Î”v=2 line intensity
ratios from an observed spectrum. To achieve this good agreement, an alteration
in the method of converting matrix elements from Hund×³s case (b) to (a) was made.
Partitions sums have been calculated using the new energy levels, for the temperature
range 5â€“6000 K, which extends the previously available (in HITRAN) 70â€“3000 K
range. The resulting absolute transition strengths have been used to calculate O
abundances in the Sun, Arcturus, and two red giants in the Galactic open and globular
clusters \{M67\} and M71. Literature data based mainly on [O I] lines are available
for the Sun and Arcturus, and excellent agreement is found.},

Based on the accurate ab initio calculations of the potential energy curves, transition dipole moments and nonadiabatic couplings between the relevant states, the dissociation dynamics are investigated using the time-dependent quantum wave packet approach. The direct dissociation, following the excitation from the specific vibrational levels of the ground state X2Π to the repulsive state 12Σ- is examined, where the total and partial cross sections and the branching fractions of spin–orbit fine-structures of O(3PJ) are calculated over a wide range of the incident photon frequencies. For the predissociation via the bound excited state A2Σ+, the influence of the nonadiabatic interactions in different internuclear regions and the role of the repulsive states in the dissociation starting at different vibrational levels are also analyzed through the spin–orbit branching fractions of products. }

	abstract = { This paper describes a joint experimental and theoretical study of the photodissociation of vibrationally excited hydroxyl radicals. OH and OD radicals produced in a pulsed electric discharge supersonic beam are state-selected and focused by a hexapole and then photo-dissociated by a single laser tuned to various H/D or O atom (2 + 1) resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) wavelengths between 243 nm and 200 nm. The angle velocity distributions of the resulting O+ and D+ photofragment ions were recorded using velocity map imaging. Photodissociation to the O(3PJ) + H(2S) limit is shown to take place by one-photon excitation to the repulsive 1 2Σ− state. The experimental data shows that vibrationally excited OH/OD which are formed in the discharge are dissociated, and a vibrational temperature of ≈2000 K was estimated for the beam source. An analysis in the high-energy recoil sudden limit is used to predict the O(3PJ) fine structure branching ratios and alignment information in the molecular and laboratory velocity frame of the imaging experiment. The measured and predicted fine structure branching ratios and alignment parameters agree well at all dissociation wavelengths, supporting the model for photodissociation in the sudden limit regime. Several aspects of the experiment such as OH pre-alignment and orientation, ion-recoil, and Doppler-free imaging are discussed. }

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2008}},

Pages = {L29-L33},
Abstract = {{Context. Airglow emissions, such as previously observed from NO and
   O(2)(a - X) (0-0) on Venus, provide insight into the chemical and
   dynamical processes that control the composition and energy balance in
   the upper atmospheres of planets. The OH airglow emission has been
   observed previously only in the Earth's atmosphere where it has been
   used to infer atomic oxygen abundances. The O(2)(a - X) (0-1) airglow
   emission also has only been observed in the Earth's atmosphere, and
   neither laboratory nor theoretical studies have reached a consensus on
   its transition probability.
   Aims. We report measurements of night-side airglow emission in the
   atmosphere of Venus in the OH (2-0), OH (1-0), O(2)(a - X) (0-1), and
   O(2) (a - X) (0-0) bands. This is the first detection of the first three
   of these airglow emissions on another planet. These observations provide
   the most direct observational constraints to date on H, OH, and O(3),
   key species in the chemistry of Venus' upper atmosphere.
   Methods. Airglow emission detected at wavelengths of 1.40-1.49 and
   2.6-3.14 mu m in limb observations by the Visible and Infrared Thermal
   Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on the Venus Express spacecraft is
   attributed to the OH (2-0) and (1-0) transitions, respectively, and
   compared to calculations from a photochemical model. Simultaneous limb
   observations of airglow emission in the O(2)( a- X) (0-0) and (0-1)
   bands at 1.27 and 1.58 mu m, respectively, were used to derive the ratio
   of the transition probabilities for these bands.
   Results. The integrated emission rates for the OH (2-0) and (1-0) bands
   were measured to be 100 +/- 40 and 880 +/- 90 kR respectively, both
   peaking at an altitude of 96 +/- 2 km near midnight local time for the
   considered orbit. The measured ratio of the O(2)(a - X) (0-0) and (0-1)
   bands is 78 +/- 8.
   Conclusions. Photochemical model calculations suggest the observed OH
   emission is produced primarily via the Bates-Nicolet mechanism, as on
   the Earth. The observed ratio of the intensities of the O(2)(a - X)
   (0-0) and (0-1) bands implies the ratio of their transition
   probabilities is 63 +/- 6.}},

The theory is employed to treat the photodissociation of OH molecule. Two frame transformation matrices are constructed and incorporated, for the first time, to describe the correlations between two oxygen terms [O(3P) and O(1D)] and the adiabatic Born–Oppenheimer states. We find that very interesting dynamics results from the quantum interferences between electronic states. Near the dissociation threshold to O(3P), asymptotic interactions between asymptotically degenerate states correlating to O(3P) term are shown to manifest as multichannel resonances. At energies between thresholds to O(3P) and O(1D) terms, quantum interferences between A2Σ+ and 2Σ− states are predicted to result in asymmetric resonances. Partial cross sections to the triplet oxygen fine structure states O(3Pj, j=0,1,2) exhibit different degrees of asymmetry due to the combined effects of the quantum interference between A2Σ+ and 2Σ− states crossing in the Franck–Condon region, and the asymptotic interactions among 4Σ−, 2Σ−, and 4Π states correlating to O(3P). Consequently, the branching ratios of O(3Pj, j=0,1,2) exhibit strong variations across the asymmetric resonances, suggesting the possibility of controlling the product distributions by tuning at the excitation wavelengths across a single asymmetric resonance in one‐photon process. Interference between the dissociative 2Δ and 22Π states, correlating with O(1D) term, are shown to give rise to highly oscillatory variations of the dissociation cross sections to O(1D) at energies above the threshold to O(1D).}",

Continuous absorption into the repulsive 12Σ- state is major destruction path. The calculated lifetimes are generally consistent with the lifetimes inferred from observations, but suggest some elaboration of the models is necessary.

The process of photodissociation by absorption into the coupled 2Π states is studied theoretically. The adiabatic electronic eigenfunctions and potential energy curves of the 22Π and 32Π states are calculated using large configuration‐interaction (CI) representations and the nuclear radial coupling matrix elements are obtained by numerical differentiation. The coupled equations for the nuclear wave functions of the two states are set up in an adiabatic and in a diabatic formulation and are solved by numerical integration. The electric dipole transition moments connecting the ground X2Π state to the 22Π and 32Π states are computed from the CI wave functions and the resulting photodissociation cross sections of OH arising from absorption into the coupled 22Π and 32Π states are obtained. Two alternative sets of potential curves, coupling matrix elements, and transition moments are employed to provide an assessment of the accuracy of the results. The photodissociation cross section shows a series of resonances superimposed on a broad continuous background. The resonances are located near to the vibrational levels of the uncoupled bound diabatic potential curve. They have asymmetric Beutler–Fano profiles and vary in width from 50 cm−1 for the lowest levels to 2 cm−1 for the higher levels. The accuracy of adiabatic and diabatic approximations, carried to first order in the coupling, is explored and it is demonstrated that the diabatic approximation provides a more satisfactory representation of the photodissociation process. The discrete‐continuum configuration interaction theory of Fano is applied in the diabatic formulation and the resonance structures are calculated. The discrete‐continuum interaction theory yields profile parameters and level shifts which agree well with the accurate values obtained by solving the coupled equations but its application is considerably more laborious. The contribution of absorption into the coupled 2Π states to the interstellar photodissociation rate is evaluated. In the optically thin limit, the rate is1.5×10−10 s−1.

The theoretical absorption oscillator strengths for the D2Σ−(v′=0)←X2Π(v″=0) transition are in good agreement with the empirical value derived from astronomical measurements. The photodissociation cross sections for absorption from the v″=0, 1, and 2 levels of the ground state into the continuum of the 12Σ− state are calculated, and the interstellar and cometary photodissociation rates are derived.}",

    abstract = "{A systematic investigation of the excited states that may participate in the photodissociation of the OH molecule has been carried out by ab initio calculations which use two different self‐consistent field with configuration‐interaction methods. Potential energy curves for states of 2Σ+, 2Σ−, 2Π, and 2Δ symmetries have been computed and the transition dipole moments connecting the states have been obtained. Photodissociation cross sections for absorption from the v″=0 vibrational level of the ground X2Π state into the repulsive 12Δ, B2Σ+, and 22Π states are reported. It is shown that the 12Δ and B2Σ+ states, together with the 12Σ− state considered in an earlier study, are important channels for photodissociation. Photodissociation may take place also following absorption into bound electronic states and absorption oscillator strengths for these transitions have been determined. The mechanisms by which the bound states can be dissociated are discussed and estimates of the dissociation efficiencies of the mechanisms are made. Absorption into the bound 32Π state may be an important dissociation channel. Calculations of the interstellar photodissociation rate have assumed that photodissociation proceeds by absorption into the C2Σ+ state for which a large oscillator strength had been adopted. We find that the C2Σ+ channel is not significant in photodissociation and we present new estimates of the interstellar photodissociation rates. Our calculations demonstrate that OH is dissociated by the absorption of Lyman alpha radiation, a channel of particular significance in shocked interstellar gas and in cometary atmospheres.}",

abstract = {An earlier study \[Chem. Phys. Lett.1, 619 (1968)\] concluded that
the reaction H $+$ O3 {\textrightarrow} OH $+$ O2 forms OH predominantly in the
highest accessible vibrational levels, v $=$ 8 and 9. We have extended this earlier
work (1) by using fourier transform spectroscopy which is capable of giving more
precise values for the relative vibrational populations at low intensities, (2)
by recording emission down to lower background pressures (1 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}4 Torr),
and (3) by treating the vessel walls so as to remove OH† (vibrationally excited
OH in it ground 2$\Pi$ electronic state) more effectively. This involved using a
room temperature vessel coated with silica gel. Under these conditions (provided
that the values available for the radiational lifetime of OH† are correct) vibrational
relaxation of OH† should have been largely arrested. We conclude that the relative
rate constants for formation of OH† in levels v are k(v $=$ 6) \&lt; 0.4, k(v $=$ 7) $\approx$ 0.4,
k(v $=$ 8) $\approx$ 0.8, and k(v $=$ 9) $=$ 1.00.},
