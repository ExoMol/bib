Title = {The NewEra model grid},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {698},
Abstract = {Context. Analyses of stellar spectra, stellar populations, and transit
   light curves rely on grids of synthetic spectra and center-to-limb
   variations (limb darkening) from model stellar atmospheres. Extensive
   model grids from PHOENIX, a generalized non-local thermodynamic
   equilibrium (NLTE) 1D and 3D stellar atmosphere code, have found
   widespread use in the astronomical community, however current PHOENIX/1D
   models have been substantially improved over the last decade. Aims. To
   make these improvements available to the community, we have constructed
   the NewEra LTE model grid consisting of 37438 models with 2300 K <=
   T-eff <= 12 000 K, 0.0 <= log (g) <= 6.0, metallicities {[}M/H] from
   -4.0 to +0.5, and for metallicities -2.0 <= {[}M/H] <= 0.0 additional
   alpha element variations from -0.2 <= {[}alpha/Fe] <= + 1.2 are
   included. Methods. The models use databases of 851 million atomic lines
   and 834 billion molecular lines and employ the Astrophysical Chemical
   Equilibrium Solver for the equation of state. All models in the NewEra
   grid have been calculated in spherical symmetry because center-to-limb
   variation differences from plane-parallel models are quite large for
   giants and not insignificant for dwarfs. Results. All model data are
   provided in the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) format, including low
   and high sampling rate spectra. These files also include a variety of
   details about the models, such as the exact abundances and isotopic
   patterns used and results of the atomic and molecular line selection.
   Conclusions. Although the model structures have small differences with
   the previous grid generation, the spectra show significant differences,
   mostly due to the updates of the molecular line lists.},

Title = {{Origin and Extent of the Opacity Challenge for Atmospheric Retrievals of
   WASP-39 b}},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {950},
Abstract = {As the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) came online last summer, we
   entered a new era of astronomy. This new era is supported by data
   products of unprecedented information content that require novel
   reduction and analysis techniques. Recently, Niraula et al. (N22)
   highlighted the need for upgraded opacity models to prevent facing a
   model-driven accuracy wall when interpreting exoplanet transmission
   spectra. Here, we follow the same approach as N22 to explore the
   sensitivity of inferences on the atmospheric properties of WASP-39 b to
   the opacity models used. We find that the retrieval of the main
   atmospheric properties from this first JWST exoplanet spectrum is mostly
   unaffected by the current state of the community's opacity models.
   Abundances of strong opacity sources like water and carbon dioxide are
   reliably constrained within \& SIM;0.30 dex, beyond the 0.50 dex
   accuracy wall reported in N22. Assuming the completeness and accuracy of
   line lists, N22's accuracy wall is primarily driven by model
   uncertainties on broadening coefficients and far-wing behaviors, which
   we find to have marginal consequences for interpreting the transmission
   spectra of large, hot, high-metallicity atmospheres such as WASP-39 b,
   in opposition to emission spectra and climate modeling, which depend on
   deeper parts of a planetary atmosphere. The origin of the opacity
   challenge in the retrieval of metal-rich hot Jupiters via transmission
   spectroscopy will thus mostly stem from the incompleteness and
   inaccuracy of line lists.},

Title = {Checking the reliability of opacity databases},
Journal = EPJD,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {77},
Abstract = {Mathematical inequalities, combined with atomic-physics sum rules,
   enable one to derive lower and upper bounds for the Rosseland and/or
   Planck mean opacities. The resulting constraints must be satisfied,
   either for pure elements or mixtures. The intriguing law of anomalous
   numbers, also named Benford's law, is of great interest to detect errors
   in line-strength collections required for fine-structure calculations.
   Testing regularities may reveal hidden properties, such as the fractal
   nature of complex atomic spectra. The aforementioned constraints can
   also be useful to assess the reliability of experimental measurements.
   Finally, we recall that it is important to quantify the uncertainties
   due to interpolations in density-temperature opacity (or more generally
   atomic-data) tables, and that convergence studies are of course
   unavoidable in order to address the issue of completeness in terms of
   levels, configurations or superconfigurations, which is a cornerstone of
   opacity calculations.},
