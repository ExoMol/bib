abstract = {Growing astronomical interest in phosphorous (P) chemistry is stimulating
the search for new interstellar P-bearing molecules, a task requiring detailed
knowledge of the microwave and infrared molecular spectrum. In this work, we present
comprehensive rotation-vibration line lists of the cis- and trans-isomers of
diphosphene (P2H2). The line lists have been generated using robust, first-principles
methodologies based on newly computed, high-level ab initio potential energy and
dipole moment surfaces. Transitions are considered between states with energies
up to 8000 cmâˆ’1 and total angular momentum J â‰¤ 25. These are the first-ever line
lists to be reported for P2H2, and they should significantly facilitate future
spectroscopic characterization of this system. The deuterated species trans-P2HD
and the effect of its dynamic dipole moment on the rovibrational spectrum are
also discussed.},

volume = {8},
number = {5},
pages = {1663-1670},
abstract = {The dependence of the relative energies of 116 diphosphene and
diphosphinylidene compounds on the modification of their structures is studied
theoretically. Optimized geometries and relative energies are reported for all
structures. With the purpose of investigating the effects of various substituents
on the parent PPH2 and HPPH molecules, isodesmic reaction energies were obtained
for single and double substitution. In the case of the substitution of both H
atoms by lithoxy (OLi) or ONa groups is the diphosphinylidene type structure found
to be lower in energy. For the lithoxy group, the energy difference amounts to 33
kcal/mol at CCSD(T) cc-pVTZ level of theory. This result is explained through the
natural population analyses, where a very favorable Coulombic attraction is found
in the OLi substituted diphosphinylidene structure. The order of the effectiveness
of the substituents in lowering the relative energy of the diphosphinylidene structure
is OLi > ONa > OH > OSiH3 > OCH3 > OPh > NH2 > N(CH3)2 > F > ONH2 > OBH2 > CH3 >
OOH > Ph > BF2 > PH2 > SiH3 > SH > HCâ•?O > Cl > CF3 > Br > SiF3 > NF2 > NO2 > Câ‰¡CH
> OF > CN. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis explains other qualitative bonding
features, for example, phosphorusâ€“phosphorus bond orders as large as 2.5 for R2PP
structures and as small as 1.6 for RPPR structures.},

(singlet and triplet H2PP) and diphosphine (P2H4), as well as those of the P2H
and P2H3 radicals resulting from PH bond cleavages, have been calculated by using
high-level ab initio electronic structure theory. Energies were calculated using
coupled-cluster theory with a perturbative treatment for triple excitations (CCSD(T))
and employing augmented correlation consistent basis sets with additional tight
d-functions on P (aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z) up to quadruple- or quintuple-Î¶, to perform a
complete basis set extrapolation for the energy. Geometries and vibrational frequencies
were determined with the CCSD(T) method. Core-valence and scalar relativistic
corrections were included, as well as scaled zero-point energies. We find the
following heats of formation (kcal/mol) at 298 [0] K:â€‰ (P2H) = 53.4 [54.4];
(cis-P2H2) = 32.0 [33.9]; (trans-P2H2) = 28.7 [30.6]; (H2PP) = 53.7 [55.6]; (3H2PP)

In contrast to earlier results, we found a singlet ground state for phosphinophosphinidene
(H2PP) with a singletâˆ’triplet energy gap of 2.8 kcal/mol. We calculated the heats
of formation of the methylated derivatives CH3PPH, CH3HPPH2, CH3PPCH3, CH3HPP,
(CH3)2PP, (CH3)2PPH2, and CH3HPPHCH3 by using isodesmic reactions at the MP2/CBS
level. The calculated results for the hydrogenation reactions RPPR + H2 â†’ RHPPHR
and R2PP + H2 â†’ R2PPH2 show that substitution of an organic substituent for H
improves the energetics, suggesting that secondary diphosphines and diphosphenes
are potential candidates for use in a chemical hydrogen storage system. A comparison
with the nitrogen analogues is given. The mechanism for H2-generation from diphosphine
without and with BH3 as a catalyst was examined. Including tunneling corrections,
the rate constant for the catalyzed reaction is 4.5 Ã— 1015 times faster than the
uncatalyzed result starting from separated catalyst and PH2PH2.},

heights for the trans-to-cis isomerization, by the planar inversion and the nonplanar
twisting, in the ground state are calculated to be 265 and 144 kJ/mol (with the
vibrational zero-point energy corrections), respectively. The latter barrier is
noticeably lower than the H-P and the P-P bond dissociation energies oftrans-HP=PH

(2A'), which is to be formed by the dehydrogenation of HP=PH, should suffer further

The lowest excited state of HP2 is found to be a hydrogen-bridged 3Ï€-electron

level with relative energies estimated by single-point calculations at the MP4/
6-311++G (df, p) level, including zero-point corrections. For H2CS the reason for
previous conflicting reports is explained; it is confirmed that the 1,2 shift takes
place in the molecular plane. In H2PN, out-of-plane transfer is marginally favoured
over in-plane, suggesting that the latter becomes effective in substituted phosphazenes.
In contrast, out-of-plane transfer predominates in H2P2. These results suggest
that the migrating hydrogen behaves as a hydride at the transition states in H2CS
and H2PN but as a proton in H2P2. Stabilizing interactions between the migrating
proton and the Ï€ electron of the double bond favours an out-of-plane migration in
the latter case. Relative energies are estimated as follows (in kcal/mol): H2CS

state is trans-HP=PH, 3.5 kcal/mol below cis-HP=PH. The H/sub 2/P=P isomer lies
at a relative energy of 28 kcal/mol above the ground state. For the ground state
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is n/sub +/, a symmetric lone-pair
combination; the second HOMO is the P-P ..pi.. bond. In H/sub 2/P=P a lone pair
n/sub y/ is the HOMO, and the P-P ..pi.. bond is the second HOMO. For both isomers
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is the antibonding P-P ..pi..* orbital.
A variety of states involving n-..pi..* and ..pi..-..pi..* excitations have been
studied for various molecular geometries. The lowest energy open-shell singlet is
a pyramidal H/sub 2/PP /sup 1/A'' state (out-of-plane angle 77/sup 0/) at a relative
