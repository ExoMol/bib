abstract = {As a sequel paper to our study of the elastic scattering for electron
collisions with phosphorus trifluoride, PF3 molecules, we report absolute inelastic
differential and integral cross sections (DCS and ICS) of vibrational excitations
for the compound fundamental vibrational modes v13 (v1 + v3), v24 (v2 + v4), and
their sum in the impact energy range of 2.0–10 eV and over a scattering angle
range of 20°–130°. The measured angular distributions of scattered electron intensities
for the present inelastic scattering are normalized to the elastic peak intensity
corresponding to the DCSs of He. These vibrational excitation measurements demonstrate
the presence of resonances around 2 eV and also around 6–10 eV. In addition, a
generalized oscillator strength analysis is applied to derive oscillator strength
f0-values and (unscaled Born) ICSs from the corresponding DCSs measured for the
low-lying optically allowed 8a1−1 → 7e (σ*) excitation band, which is assigned
as the Jahn-Teller splitting and 8a1−1 → 4s Rydberg transition at impact energies
of 100, 200, and 300 eV, over a scattering angle range of 1.0°–15°. The f0-values
obtained in the present study are compared with the results of previous photoabsorption
and pseudo-optical measurements. The unscaled Born ICSs are compared with the
binary-encounter f-scaled Born ICSs estimated over a wide impact energy region

electron collisions with phosphorus trifluoride, PF3, molecules (e− + PF3) in
the impact energy range of 2.0–200 eV and over a scattering angle range of 10°–150°.
Measured angular distributions of scattered electron intensities were normalized
by reference to the elastic DCSs of He. Corresponding integral and momentum-transfer
cross sections were derived by extrapolating the angular range from 0° to 180°
with the help of a modified phase-shift analysis. In addition, due to the large
dipole moment of the considered molecule, the dipole-Born correction for the forward
scattering angles has also been applied. As a part of this study, independent
atom model calculations in combination with screening corrected additivity rule
were also performed for elastic and inelastic (electronic excitation plus ionization)
scattering using a complex optical potential method. Rotational excitation cross
sections have been estimated with a dipole-Born approximation procedure. Vibrational
excitations are not considered in this calculation. Theoretical data, at the
differential and integral levels, were found to reasonably agree with the present
experimental results. Furthermore, we explore the systematics of the elastic DCSs
for the four-atomic trifluoride molecules of XF3 (X = B, N, and P) and central
P-atom in PF3, showing that, owing to the comparatively small effect of the F-atoms,
the present angular distributions of elastic DCSs are essentially dominated by
the characteristic of the central P-atom at lower impact energies. Finally, these
quantitative results for e− − PF3 collisions were compiled together with the
previous data available in the literature in order to obtain a cross section
dataset for modeling purposes. To comprehensively describe such a considerable
amount of data, we proceed by first discussing, in this paper, the vibrationally
elastic scattering processes whereas vibrational and electronic excitation shall
be the subject of our following paper devoted to inelastic collisions.},

overtone level. The present paper reports on the first complete study of both
sublevels of v4 = 2 (of A1 and E symmetry, corresponding to l4 = 0 and ±2, respectively),
through the high-resolution analysis of the overtone 2ν40 band and the 2ν4±2-ν4±1
hot band. The assignments of the latter were corrected and extended, spanning
the rotational states J ⩽ 82 and −80 ⩽ K″ · ΔK ⩽ 48. These new infrared assignments
in the v4 = 2 state were combined with accurate infrared, radiofrequency, centimeter-,
millimeter- and submillimeter-wave data of the v4 = 1 level (Thiessen et al., 2000),
together with rotational data in the ground vibrational state (Cotti et al., 1995),
in a simultaneous fit. The existence of resonance crossings due to a Δk = ±1, Δl = ∓2
l-type resonance in the v4 = 1 state, which generated perturbation-allowed transitions,
provided independent values of the C4 and Cζ4 constants. Combining these rotational
transitions with the wavenumbers of the ν4 fundamental band enabled us to determine
accurately the C0 axial ground state constant. Moreover, the assignment of a few,
very weak rRK transitions in the 2ν4-2 overtone band and their inclusion in the
global least-squares fit allowed also the first accurate experimental determination
of DK0. The obtained results are (in cm−1): C0 = 0.159970241(29) and DK0=1.80457(49) × 10−7.
Quadratic, cubic, and semidiagonal quartic force fields of PF3 have been calculated
at the CCSD(T) level of theory employing a variety of large correlation-consistent
basis sets. These force fields have been used to evaluate spectroscopic constants
which are generally found to be in very good agreement with experiment. The present
best estimate of the re structure of PF3 based on an explicitly correlated
coupled-cluster approach (CCSD(T)-F12b) is almost identical with its latest
experimental counterpart.},

abstract = {A classical microscopic theory of rovibrational motion at high angular
momenta in symmetrical nonlinear molecules AB2 is derived within the framework of
small oscillations near the stationary states of a rotating molecule. The
full‐dimensional analysis including stretching vibrations has confirmed the
existence of the bifurcation predicted previously by means of the rigid‐bender
model [see B. I. Zhilinskii and I. M. Pavlichenkov, Opt. Spectrosk. (USSR) 64, 413 (1988)].
The formation of fourfold energy clusters resulting from the bifurcation has
been experimentally verified for H2Se and it has been demonstrated in fully‐dimensional
quantum mechanical calculations carried out with the MORBID computer program.
We show in the present work that apart from the level clustering, the bifurcation
produces physically important effects including molecular symmetry‐breaking and
a transition from the normal mode to the local mode limit for the stretching
vibrations due to the centrifugal forces. The application of the present theory
with realistic molecular potentials to the H2Te, H2Se, and H2S hydrides results
in predictions of the bifurcation points very close to those calculated previously.
However for the lighter H2O molecule we find that the bifurcation occurs at higher
values of the total angular momentum than obtained in previous estimations. The
present work shows it to be very unlikely that the bifurcation in H2O will lead
to clustering of energy levels. This result is in agreement with recent variational
calculations.},

combination band ν2+ ν4(834.055 7 cm−1) with a resolution of ca. 2.5 × 10−3cm−1.
Furthermore, spectra of the 2ν2, 2ν2− ν2, (ν2+ ν4) − ν4, and (ν2+ ν4) − ν2bands
were measured and analyzed. The vibrotational analysis of the ν1and ν3bands confirmed
the presence of a Coriolisx,yresonance whose interaction parameter could be determined
experimentally. A transition moment ratio μ1:μ3close to 0.7 has been deduced from
a band contour simulation for a negative sign of the intensity perturbation μ1ζ1,3μ3.
Furthermore, anharmonic resonance between ν3and ν2+ ν4was established, the strength
of which is in agreement with an interaction constantW234= 2.86 cm−1as suggested
by ab initio calculations. More than 5000 rovibrational transitions belonging
to ν1, ν3, and ν2+ ν4were fitted together with all available pure rotational
data, σ(Fit) of the IR data being 3.93 × 10−4cm−1. It was found thatqresonance
within ν3induces an avoided crossing of thek[formula]= 1,A−with thek[formula]=
−2,A−sublevel nearJ= 12. Its effects give rise to an irregularA1A2splitting ofP(PQR)3

picture of hyperfine effects in strong (case-2) rotational clusters. Analogous
types of clusters within clusters are discussed using this theoretical model.
The possibility emerges for new and very sensitive type of spectra which we label
superhyperfine structure. This structure has some remarkable similarities with
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, and it might be an even more revealing
indicator of internal molecular dynamics than NMR. Model Hamiltonians are represented
in all the elementary types of cluster bases and some examples are solved using
tableau techniques. Level correlations between case-1 and case-2 clusters are sketched.

indicating that planar NF3 is not bound relative to NF2+F. For PF3 and PCl3, bond
dissociation is energetically competitive with inversion, since the experimental
first bond dissociation energies are 130±14 and 81±5 kcal/mole, respectively. The
lowest energy closed shell electronic configuration for planar PF3 is shown to
have the phosphorus nonbonding (lone pair) electrons in a A1′ type orbital, rather
