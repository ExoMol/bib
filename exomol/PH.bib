Pages = {691-701},
Abstract = {{In this tutorial review we consider the role of phosphorus and its
   compounds within the context of chemical evolution in galaxies.
   Following an interdisciplinary approach we first discuss the position of
   P among the main biogenic elements by considering its relevance in most
   essential biochemical functions as well as its peculiar chemistry under
   different physicochemical conditions. Then we review the phosphorus
   distribution in different cosmic sites, such as terrestrial planets,
   interplanetary dust particles, cometary dust, planetary atmospheres and
   the interstellar medium ( ISM). In this way we realize that this element
   is both scarce and ubiquitous in the universe. These features can be
   related to the complex nucleosynthesis of P nuclide in the cores of
   massive stars under explosive conditions favouring a wide distribution
   of this element through the ISM, where it would be ready to react with
   other available atoms. A general tendency towards more oxidized
   phosphorus compounds is clearly appreciated as chemical evolution
   proceeds from circumstellar and ISM materials to protoplanetary and
   planetary condensed matter phases. To conclude we discuss some possible
   routes allowing for the incorporation of phosphorus compounds of
   prebiotic interest during the earlier stages of solar system formation.}},

Title = {Theoretical investigation on molecular constants of PH, PD and PT
   molecules},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {61},
Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of the PH (X-3 Sigma(-), a(1) Delta
   and A(3) Pi) are investigated by the highly accurate valence internally
   contracted multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method and
   the MRCI method including the Davidson modification (+Q) in combination
   with the correlation-consistent basis sets, aug-cc-pV5Z. With these PECs
   obtained here, the spectroscopic parameters of three isotopologues, PH
   (X-3 Sigma(-), a(1) Delta and A(3) Pi), PD (X-3 Sigma(-), a(1) Delta and
   A(3) Pi) and PT (X-3 Sigma(-), a(1) Delta and A(3) Pi), are determined.
   These parameters are compared in detail with those previously reported
   in the literature, and agreement is found between the present results
   and the experimental data. The values of vibrational level G(nu),
   inertial rotation constant B-nu and centrifugal distortion constant D-nu
   for the first 12 vibrational levels of PH (X-3 Sigma(-)), PD (X-3
   Sigma(-)) and PT (X-3 Sigma(-)), are calculated when the rotational
   quantum number J equals zero, which are in agreement with the available
   measurements. Comparison with the available experimental data shows that
   the present molecular constants are accurate.},

Title = {Fourier transform infrared emission spectroscopy of ND and PH},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {1996},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {329-336},
Abstract = {The infrared vibration-rotation bands of ND in the X(3) Sigma(-) state
   were recorded using a Fourier transform spectrometer. The bands were
   observed in a microwave discharge of a mixture of N-2 and D-2 in the
   presence of He. The rotational structure of six bands, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2,
   4-3, 5-4, and 6-5, has been observed in the 1800-2600 cm(-1) region. The
   analysis of these bands provides an independent determination of the
   ground state vibrational constants in addition to an improved set of
   rotational constants. The principal molecular constants for the ground
   state are
   omega(e) = 2399.1255(299) cm(-1), w(e)x(e), = 42.1064(212) cm(-1), W-e
   gamma(e) = 0.1203(54) cm(-1)
   B-e = 8.908665(146) cm(-1), alpha(e) = 0.254570(192) cm(-1), r(e) =
   1.036651(9) Angstrom.
   The molecular constants for PH have also been refined by combining the
   previous infrared {[}J. Mel. Spectrosc. 275-281 (1987)] and the recent
   submillimeter-wave {[}Chem Phys. Lett. 211, 443-448 (1993)]

   around M Dwarfs}},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {1219-1232},
Abstract = {{One signature of life on Earth is the vegetation red edge (VRE) feature
   of land plants, a dramatic change of reflectivity at wavelength near
   0.7m. Potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs are tidally locked,
   which can limit the distribution of land plants. In this study, we used
   a biogeochemical model to investigate the distribution of land plants on
   potentially habitable planets around M dwarfs driven by climate data
   produced in a general circulation model (GCM). When considering the
   effects of clouds, the observation time needed for VRE detection on
   nearby p=1 exoplanets around nearby M dwarfs is on the order of days
   using a 25m(2) telescope if a large continent faces Earth during
   observations. For p=1.5 exoplanets, the detection time could be similar
   if land plants developed the capability to endure a dark/cold
   environment for extended periods of time and the continent configuration
   favors observations. Our analysis suggests that hypothetical
   exovegetation VRE features are easier to detect than Earth vegetation
   and that VRE detection is possible for nearby exoplanets even under
   cloudy conditions. Key Words: Vegetation red edgeExoplanetsM

Title = {{Biogeodynamics: bridging the gap between surface and deep Earth
   processes}},
Journal =PTRSA,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{376}},
Abstract = {{Life is sustained by a critical and not insubstantial set of elements,
   nearly all of which are contained within large rock reservoirs and
   cycled between Earth's surface and the mantle via subduction zone plate
   tectonics. Over geologic time scales, plate tectonics plays a critical
   role in recycling subducted bioactive elements lost to the mantle back
   to the ocean-biosphere system, via outgassing and volcanism. Biology
   additionally relies on tectonic processes to supply rock-bound
   `nutrients' to marine and terrestrial ecosystems via uplift and erosion.
   Thus, the development of modern-style plate tectonics and the generation
   of stable continents were key events in the evolution of the biosphere
   on Earth, and similar tectonic processes could be crucial for the
   development of habitability on exoplanets. Despite this vital
   `biogeodynamic' connection, directly testing hypotheses about feedbacks
   between the deep Earth and the biosphere remains challenging. Here, I
   discuss potential avenues to bridge the biosphere-geosphere gap,
   focusing specifically on the global cycling and bioavailability of major
   nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) over geologic time scales.
   This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Earth dynamics and
   the development of plate tectonics'.}},

Title = {{An L Band Spectrum of the Coldest Brown Dwarf}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{858}},
Abstract = {{The coldest brown dwarf, WISE 0855, is the closest known planetary-mass,
   free-floating object and has a temperature nearly as cold as the solar
   system gas giants. Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere
   rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE
   0855 is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its
   energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer et al. presented a spectrum of WISE
   0855 from 4.5-5.1 mu m (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here,
   we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in the L band, from 3.4-4.14 mu m. We
   present a set of atmosphere models that include a range of compositions
   (metallicities and C/O ratios) and water ice clouds. Methane absorption
   is clearly present in the spectrum. The mid-infrared color can be better
   matched with a methane abundance that is depleted relative to solar
   abundance. We find that there is evidence for water ice clouds in the M
   band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral features in both
   the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum opacity
   source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep
   phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of
   WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres,
   bridging the temperature range between the long-studied solar system
   planets and accessible exoplanets. The James Webb Space Telescope will
   soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with
   high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study
   their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric
   dynamics and formation processes.}},
