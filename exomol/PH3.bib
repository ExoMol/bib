  abstract={We present a statistical analysis of the Kepler M dwarf planet hosts, with a particular focus on the fractional number of systems hosting multiple transiting planets. We manufacture synthetic planetary systems within a range of planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler yield. Similarly to studies of Kepler exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of singly transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a single population of multi-planet systems, a finding that cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 53 ± 10\% of planetary systems are either single or contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. The other 47 ± 10\% of systems contain ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/816/2/66/apj521700ieqn1.gif] {${7.5}_{-1.5}^{+0.5}$} planets with mutual inclinations of 2.°0 ± 1.°3. This mutual inclination range is consistent with studies of transit durations within multiply transiting systems. The mixture model is preferred 8:1 to a model with only one architecture. Thus, we find that the so-called “ Kepler dichotomy” holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs as well as Sun-like stars.}

  abstract={We use solar occultations observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on board the Cassini Spacecraft to extract the 1–5 μ m transmission spectrum of Saturn, as if it were a transiting exoplanet. We detect absorption from methane, ethane, acetylene, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and possibly carbon monoxide, with peak-to-peak features of up to 90 parts-per-million despite the presence of ammonia clouds. We also find that atmospheric refraction, as opposed to clouds or haze, determines the minimum altitude that could be probed during mid-transit. Self-consistent exoplanet atmosphere models show good agreement with Saturn’s transmission spectrum but fail to reproduce a large absorption feature near 3.4 μ m, likely caused by gaseous ethane and a C–H stretching mode of an unknown aliphatic hydrocarbon. This large feature is located in one of the Spitzer Space Telescope bandpasses and could alter interpretations of transmission spectra if not properly modeled. The large signal in Saturn’s transmission spectrum suggests that transmission spectroscopy of cold, long-period gaseous exoplanets should be possible with current and future observatories. Motivated by these results, we briefly consider the feasibilityof using a survey to search for and characterize cold exoplanets that are analogous to Jupiter and Saturn utilizing a target-of-opportunity approach.}

The {DMS} analytical representation is determined through an expansion in symmetry adapted products of internal nonlinear coordinates up to the 8th order. Including high order terms permits significantly reducing the fit errors for ab initio dipole moment values in a large range of nuclear geometries. Rovibrational line strengths in the infrared are variationally computed from {DMS} using normal mode Eckart frame approach. Comparison of results obtained with four basis sets up to {V5Z} is presented. Integrated intensities of four lower {PH3} polyads up to J = 20 are in a good agreement with the {HITRAN} 2012 database and with available spectroscopic data analyses. A particular focus of the study is the Octad range (2650–3700 cm−1) containing eight interacting bands 3ν2, 2ν2 + ν4, ν2 + 2ν4, ν1 + ν2, ν2 + ν3, 3ν4, ν3 + ν4 and ν1 + ν4, where new ab initio predictions are expected to help further analyses of experimental spectra.

title = {Ammonia, Water Clouds and Methane Abundances of Giant Exoplanets and Opportunities for Super-Earth Exoplanets},
journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.7582},
year = {2014},
abstract = {Future direct-imaging exoplanet missions such as WFIRST/AFTA, Exo-C,
and Exo-S will measure the reflectivity of exoplanets at visible wavelengths.
The exoplanets to be observed will be located further away from their parent
stars than is Earth from the Sun. These "cold" exoplanets have atmospheric environments
conducive for the formation of water and/or ammonia clouds, like Jupiter in the Solar
System. We study the science return from direct-imaging exoplanet missions, focusing
on the exoplanet atmospheric compositions. First, the study shows that a low-resolution (R=70)
reflection spectrum of a giant exoplanet at 600 - 1000 nm, for a moderate signal-to-noise
ratio of 20, will allow measurements of both the pressure of the uppermost cloud
deck and the mixing ratio of methane, if the uppermost cloud deck is located at
the pressure level of 0.6 - 1.5 bars. Further increasing the signal-to-noise ratio
can improve the measurement range of the cloud deck pressure to 0.2 - 4 bars. The
strong and the weak absorption bands of methane allow the simultaneous measurements
of cloud and gas; when the uppermost cloud deck is located shallower than the pressure
level of 0.2, the weak bands are muted, and the cloud deck pressure and the mixing
ratio of methane are not distinguishable from a single reflection spectrum. Second,
future direct-imaging exoplanet missions may detect the broadband reflectivity of
a few super-Earth exoplanets. If having H2O-dominated atmospheres, directly imaged
super Earths are likely to have water clouds located shallower than 1E-3 bars. The
very high clouds on these planets would mute most gas absorption features except
for H2O, and these planets would occupy a confined phase space in the color-color
diagrams.},

	W. Thiel, S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal, P. Jensen, J. Chem. Phys.
	129 (2008) 044309] and it extends, and uses a dipole moment surface
	from, our previous work on PH3 intensities [S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal,
	W. Thiel, P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 239 (2006) 71-87]. Owing
	to an improved potential energy surface, the transition-moment results
	of the present work constitute a significant improvement over our
	previous work. The quality of the reproduction of the available experimental
	data suggests that we are approaching a situation where theoretical
	calculations of intensity information can compete with, and possibly
	in some cases replace, experimental determinations of intensities
	for small molecules. We demonstrate that the theoretical intensity
	results of the present work are in accordance with the predictions
	of local-mode theory.}

   the C-3v geometrical symmetry of PH3 is broken at high rotational
   excitation. The conclusions drawn from the quantum-mechanical

	A modified symmetric inversion potential is introduced to describe

	cm-1) is in excellent agreement with the experimental values (0.794
	cm-1/0.053 cm-1). The tunneling rate for PH3 suggests that previously
	published values are wrong by orders of magnitude. Correlation effects
	do not change the barriers significantly in accordance with Freed's
	theorem. This has been studied in more detail for BiH3 at the quadratic
	configuration-interaction (QCI) level. Relativistic effects increase
	the barrier height of BiH3 by 81.6 kJ/mol at the QCI level. Nonrelativistic
	and relativistic extended Huckel calculations suggest that the a1
	highest occupied molecular orbital, which is antibonding to the Bi
	6s, relieves part of its antibonding character near equilibrium geometry
	due to the relativistic radial contraction of the 6s orbital and
	hence increases the barrier height. In the planar transition state
	this orbital is a nonbonding a2?. The increasing trend in barrier
	heights from NH3 to BiH3 can be explained by a second-order Jahn-Teller
	distortion of the trigonal planar geometry. Vibrational frequencies

abstract = {The role of phosphorus in limiting organic matter production and in
causing eutrophication has been in the forefront of hydrobiological research
during the past 30–50 yr1–7. Comparing the cycles of major biogenic elements, it
is evident that, with the exception of phosphorus, each of them contains gaseous
substances (for example, CO2, CH4, O2, N2, NH3, H2S and volatile organic sulphur
compounds) which, because of their gaseous state, can leave aquatic systems8–16.
We examined the phosphorus cycle of open-air sewage treatment plants and a deficit
(∼30–45%) in the phosphorus mass balance was found which cannot be explained by
knowledge based on earlier research on this cycle of the hydrosphere. By developing
special sampling and analytical methods, we have shown that gases released from
the sewage treatment plants and from the sediments of shallow (1–2 m deep) waters
contain a reduced, gaseous phosphorus compound: phosphine. According to our
measurements and calculations, about 5g of phosphorus per day was released as
phosphine from an Imhoff tank settling 2,000 m3 per day of raw sewage. Under laboratory
conditions, it was also demonstrated that phosphine is released by bacterial reduction
from a medium containing inorganic phosphorus. The phosphorus content of the medium
decreases by nearly one half. Our results on the metabolic importance of phosphine
formation and release suggest that ∼25–50% of the phosphorus deficit in open-air
sewage treatment plants can be explained by the release of phosphine into the
atmosphere. These results change our understanding of the aquatic phosphorus cycle;
former ideas about the phosphorus budget should be revised.},

  abstract = {The microwave spectrum of the mono-deuterated phosphine (PH2D), arsine
	(AsH2D), and stibine (SbH2D) has been measured. Although a supposedly
	pure sample of stibine was prepared, phosphine and arsine proved
	to be major impurities. They were separated from the sample; the
	microwave spectrometer was used to monitor the distillation process.
	The quadrupole fine structure associated with the absorption transitions
	for AsH2D is used to illustrate the special assumptions which may
	be made with these molecules having an axis of charge symmetry. These
	assumptions allow one to rotate the coordinate system from the chargesymmetry
	axes to the inertial axes without thereby adding unknown cross derivatives
	to the descriptions of the dyadic "inverse" \delta Ezz. Interpretation
	of the spectrum of SbH2D is more complicated. It is not found possible
	to fit the theory to the observed lines without making use of the
	second-order perturbations caused by a nearby level of different
	symmetry but of the same J. This perturbation involves the cross
	derivatives which had previously been assumed to be zero. With the
	assumption of cross derivatives approximately one percent of the
	diagonal terms, the theory fitted experiment within the experimental
	error. The electric quadrupole interaction in arsine and stibine
	is thus determined.
	
	In order to measure the electric dipole moment of arsine and stibine,
	a slight extension is made to the theory of asymmetric tops in a
	uniform electric field.
	
	The ground-state inversion splitting is determined to be less than
	0.5 Mc/sec for all three molecules.
	
	The rotational transitions observed were such that a determination
	of the structure of these three molecules is made.},
