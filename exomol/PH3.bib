abstract = {Due to its major interest for the chemistry of planetary atmospheres and exobiology, accurate spectroscopy data of phosphine are required for the search of signatures of this molecule in astronomical observations. In this work, high resolution infrared laboratory spectra of phosphine were analyzed for the first time in the full Tetradecad region (3769 - 4763 cm-1) involving 26 rotationally resolved bands. Overall, 3242 lines were assigned in spectra previously recorded by Fourier transform spectroscopy at temperatures 200 K and 296 K, using a combined theoretical model based on ab initio calculations. The total nuclear motion Hamiltonian of PH3 including ab initio potential energy surface, was reduced to an effective Hamiltonian using the high-order contact transformation method adapted to vibrational polyads of the AB3 symmetric top molecules, followed by empirical optimization of the parameters. At this step, the experimental line positions were reproduced with a standard deviation of 0.0026 cm-1 that provided unambiguous identification of observed transitions. The effective dipole transition moments of the bands were obtained by fitting to the intensities obtained from variational calculations using the ab initio dipole moment surface. The assigned lines were used to newly determine 1609 experimental vibration-rotational levels up to Jmax= 18 with energy in the range 3896-6037 cm-1 that represents significant extension towards higher energies compared to previous works. Transitions for all 26 sublevels of the Tetradecad were identified but with noticeably fewer transitions for fourfold excited bands because of their weaker intensity. At the final step, pressure-broadened half widths were attached to each transition and a composite line list adopting ab initio intensities and empirical line positions corrected to the accuracy of about 0.001 cm-1 for strong and medium transitions was validated against experimental spectra available in the literature.}}

Title = {Large Interferometer for Exoplanets: VIII. Where Is the Phosphine?
   Observing Exoplanetary PH3 with a Space Based Mid-Infrared Nulling
   Interferometer},
Journal = {Astrobiology},
Abstract = {Phosphine could be a key molecule in the understanding of exotic
   chemistry that occurs in (exo)planetary atmospheres. While phosphine has
   been detected in the Solar System's giant planets, it has not been
   observed in exoplanets to date. In the exoplanetary context, however, it
   has been theorized to be a potential biosignature molecule. The goal of
   our study was to identify which illustrative science cases for PH3
   chemistry are observable with a space-based mid-infrared nulling
   interferometric observatory like the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets
   (LIFE) concept. We identified a representative set of scenarios for PH3
   detections in exoplanetary atmospheres that vary over the whole dynamic
   range of the LIFE mission. We used chemical kinetics and radiative
   transfer calculations to produce forward models of these informative,
   prototypical observational cases for LIFEsim, our observation simulator
   software for LIFE. In a detailed, yet first order approximation, it
   takes a mission like LIFE: (i) about 1 h to find phosphine in a warm
   giant around a G star at 10 pc, (ii) about 10 h in H-2 or CO2 dominated
   temperate super-Earths around M star hosts at 5 pc, (iii) and even in
   100 h it seems very unlikely that phosphine would be detectable in a
   Venus-Twin with extreme PH3 concentrations at 5 pc. Phosphine in
   concentrations previously discussed in the literature is detectable in 2
   out of the 3 cases, and it is detected about an order of magnitude
   faster than in comparable cases with James Webb Space Telescope. We show
   that there is a significant number of objects accessible for these
   classes of observations. These results will be used to prioritize the
   parameter range for the next steps with more detailed retrieval
   simulations. They will also inform timely questions in the early design
   phase of a mission like LIFE and guide the community by providing
   easy-to-scale first estimates for a large part of detection space of
   such a mission.},

Abstract = {Red phosphorus, when exposed to humid environments in air, breaks down
   into toxic phosphine gas and acidic phosphorus species, presenting a

   carbon layer on red phosphorus particles to suppress phosphine and
   acidic phosphorus production. Using a combination of XPS surface
   analysis and a novel IR headspace analysis method, we developed and
   quantified an understanding of the reaction of red phosphorus with water
   vapor and the suppression of decomposition products using
   plasma-deposited carbon coatings. Phosphine production, quantified by
   IR, was accompanied by the formation of surface POx species produced as
   the particles react with water vapor. Increasing plasma deposition time
   increased thickness and uniformity of graphitic carbon coating,
   corresponding to a marked decrease in phosphine generation and formation
   of surface POx species.},

   nine strange planets, and the role of phosphine}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {499},
Pages = {505-519},
Abstract = {Colour-magnitude diagrams provide a convenient way of comparing
   populations of similar objects. When well populated with precise
   measurements, they allow quick inferences to be made about the bulk
   properties of an astronomic object simply from its proximity on a
   diagram to other objects. We present here a PYTHON toolkit that allows a
   user to produce colour-magnitude diagrams of transiting exoplanets,
   comparing planets to populations of ultra-cool dwarfs, of directly
   imaged exoplanets, to theoretical models of planetary atmospheres, and
   to other transiting exoplanets. Using a selection of near- and
   mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, we show how outliers can be
   identified for further investigation, and how emerging subpopulations
   can be identified. Additionally, we present evidence that observed
   differences in the Spitzer's 4.5 mu m flux, between irradiated Jupiters
   and field brown dwarfs, might be attributed to phosphine, which is
   susceptible to photolysis. The presence of phosphine in low-irradiation
   environments may negate the need for thermal inversions to explain
   eclipse measurements. We speculate that the anomalously low 4.5 mu m
   flux of the nightside of HD 189733b and the daysides of GJ 436b and GJ
   3470b might be caused by phosphine absorption. Finally, we use our
   toolkit to include Hubble Wide Field Camera 3 spectra, creating a new
   photometric band called the `Water band' (W-JH band) in the process. We
   show that the colour index {[}W-JH - H] can be used to constrain the C/O
   ratio of exoplanets, showing that future observations with James Webb
   Space Telescope and Ariel will be able to distinguish these populations
   if they exist, and select members for future follow-up.},

journal = {Astrobiology},
year = {2020},

pages = {235-268},
abstract = { Abstract A long-term goal of exoplanet studies is the identification
and detection of biosignature gases. Beyond the most discussed biosignature gas O2,
only a handful of gases have been considered in detail. In this study, we evaluate
phosphine (PH3). On Earth, PH3 is associated with anaerobic ecosystems, and as
such, it is a potential biosignature gas in anoxic exoplanets. We simulate the
atmospheres of habitable terrestrial planets with CO2- and H2-dominated atmospheres
and find that PH3 can accumulate to detectable concentrations on planets with
surface production fluxes of 1010 to 1014 cm−2 s−1 (corresponding to surface
concentrations of 10s of ppb to 100s of ppm), depending on atmospheric composition
and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. While high, the surface flux values are comparable
to the global terrestrial production rate of methane or CH4 (1011 cm−2 s−1) and
below the maximum local terrestrial PH3 production rate (1014 cm−2 s−1). As with
other gases, PH3 can more readily accumulate on low-UV planets, for example, planets
orbiting quiet M dwarfs or with a photochemically generated UV shield. PH3 has
three strong spectral features such that in any atmosphere scenario one of the
three will be unique compared with other dominant spectroscopic molecules. Phosphine's
weakness as a biosignature gas is its high reactivity, requiring high outgassing
rates for detectability. We calculate that tens of hours of JWST (James Webb Space Telescope)
time are required for a potential detection of PH3. Yet, because PH3 is spectrally
active in the same wavelength regions as other atmospherically important molecules
(such as H2O and CH4), searches for PH3 can be carried out at no additional observational
cost to searches for other molecular species relevant to characterizing exoplanet
habitability. Phosphine is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known abiotic
false positives on terrestrial planets from any source that could generate the
high fluxes required for detection. },

rotation about axes almost coinciding with single P─H bonds. The application of
a strong dc electric field during the centrifuge pulse favors the production of

report that the number of singly transiting planets found by Kepler is too high

cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton
planetary systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 53 ± 10% of planetary

The other 47 ± 10% of systems contain ${7.5}_{-1.5}^{+0.5}$ planets with mutual
inclinations of 2fdg0 ± 1fdg3. This mutual inclination range is consistent with
studies of transit durations within multiply transiting systems. The mixture model

title = {{Combining high-dispersion spectroscopy with high contrast imaging:
Probing rocky planets around our nearest neighbors}},
journal = AA,
year = {2015},
volume = {576},
pages = {A59},
abstract = {Context. Ground-based high-dispersion (R ~ 100 000) spectroscopy (HDS)
is proving to be a powerful technique with which to characterize extrasolar planets.
The planet signal is distilled from the bright starlight, combining ral and
time-differential filtering techniques. In parallel, high-contrast imaging (HCI)
is developing rapidly, aimed at spatially separating the planet from the star.
While HDS is limited by the overwhelming noise from the host star, HCI is limited
by residual quasi-static speckles. Both techniques currently reach planet-star
contrast limits down to ~10-5, albeit for very different types of planetary systems.
Aims: In this work, we discuss a way to combine HDS and HCI (HDS+HCI). For a planet
located at a resolvable angular distance from its host star, the starlight can be
reduced up to several orders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography.
In addition, the remaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion
spectroscopy, utilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion
spectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can in principle reach contrast
limits of ~10-5 × 10-5, although in practice this will be limited by photon noise
and/or sky-background. In contrast to current direct imaging techniques, such as
Angular Differential Imaging and Spectral Differential Imaging, it will work well
at small working angles and is much less sensitive to speckle noise. For the discovery
of previously unknown planets HDS+HCI requires a high-contrast adaptive optics
system combined with a high-dispersion R ~ 100 000 integral field spectrograph
(IFS). This combination currently does not exist, but is planned for the European
Extremely Large Telescope. Methods: We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations
with the E-ELT, both probing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths,
and starlight reflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the
infrared simulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument,
with the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R = 100 000 IFS. We include
realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric transmission
and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume R = 100 000 IFS with adaptive
optics capabilities at the E-ELT. Results: One night of HDS+HCI observations with
the E-ELT at 4.8 μm (Δλ = 0.07 μm) can detect a planet orbiting α Cen A with a
radius of R = 1.5 Rearth and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of Teq = 300 K at a
signal-to-noise (S/N) of 5. In the optical, with a Strehl ratio performance of
0.3, reflected light from an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of Proxima
Centauri can be detected at a S/N of 10 in the same time frame. Recently, first
HDS+HCI observations have shown the potential of this technique by determining
the spin-rotation of the young massive exoplanet β Pictoris b. Conclusions: The
exploration of the planetary systems of our neighbor stars is of great scientific
and philosophical value. The HDS+HCI technique has the potential to detect and
characterize temperate rocky planets in their habitable zones. Exoplanet scientists
should not shy away from claiming a significant fraction of the future ELTs to
make such observations possible.},

with peak-to-peak features of up to 90 parts-per-million despite the presence of

Self-consistent exoplanet atmosphere models show good agreement with Saturn’s

likely caused by gaseous ethane and a C–H stretching mode of an unknown aliphatic
hydrocarbon. This large feature is located in one of the Spitzer Space Telescope
bandpasses and could alter interpretations of transmission spectra if not properly
modeled. The large signal in Saturn’s transmission spectrum suggests that transmission
spectroscopy of cold, long-period gaseous exoplanets should be possible with current

abstract = {n the Solar System giant planets come in two flavours: 'gas giants'
(Jupiter and Saturn) with massive gas envelopes and 'ice giants' (Uranus and Neptune)
with much thinner envelopes around their cores. It is poorly understood how these
two classes of planets formed. High solid accretion rates, necessary to form the
cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs, heat the
envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unless accretion is
halted. We find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles (~ cm-sized particles) is
self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gap in the pebble
disc. This halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers the rapid collapse of
the super-critical gas envelope. As opposed to gas giants, ice giants do not reach
this threshold mass and can only bind low-mass envelopes that are highly enriched
by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles. This offers an explanation for the
compositional difference between gas giants and ice giants in the Solar System.
Furthermore, as opposed to planetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model
allows core formation and envelope attraction within disc life-times, provided
that solids in protoplanetary discs are predominantly in pebbles. Our results
imply that the outer regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to
halt pebble accretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant
exoplanets in wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 Earth masses of solids.},

abstract = {Phosphine (PH3) was tentatively identified a few years ago in the
carbon star envelopes IRC +10216 and CRL 2688 from observations of an emission
line at 266.9 GHz attributable to the J = 1-0 rotational transition. We report
the detection of the J = 2-1 rotational transition of PH3 in IRC +10216 using the
HIFI instrument on board Herschel, which definitively confirms the identification
of PH3. Radiative transfer calculations indicate that infrared pumping in excited
vibrational states plays an important role in the excitation of PH3 in the envelope
of IRC +10216, and that the observed lines are consistent with phosphine being
formed anywhere between the star and 100 R * from the star, with an abundance
of 10–8 relative to H2. The detection of PH3 challenges chemical models, none
of which offer a satisfactory formation scenario. Although PH3 holds just 2% of
the total available phosphorus in IRC +10216, it is, together with HCP, one of
the major gas phase carriers of phosphorus in the inner circumstellar layers,
suggesting that it could also be an important phosphorus species in other astronomical
environments. This is the first unambiguous detection of PH3 outside the solar
system, and is a further step toward a better understanding of the chemistry of
phosphorus in space.},

abstract = {The formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres
of nearly all effective temperatures. Iron and silicate condense in L dwarf
atmospheres and dissipate at the L/T transition. Minor species such as sulfides
and salts condense in mid- to late T dwarfs. For brown dwarfs below T eff ~ 450 K,
water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds. Currently, over a
dozen objects in this temperature range have been discovered, and few previous
theoretical studies have addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf or
exoplanetary spectra. Here we present a new grid of models that include the effect
of water cloud opacity. We find that they become optically thick in objects below
T eff ~ 350-375 K. Unlike refractory cloud materials, water-ice particles are
significantly nongray absorbers; they predominantly scatter at optical wavelengths
through the J band and absorb in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest
of which is at 2.8 μm. H2O, NH3, CH4, and H2 CIA are dominant opacity sources; less
abundant species may also be detectable, including the alkalis, H2S, and PH3. PH3,
which has been detected in Jupiter, is expected to have a strong signature in the
mid-infrared at 4.3 μm in Y dwarfs around T eff = 450 K; if disequilibrium chemistry
increases the abundance of PH3, it may be detectable over a wider effective temperature
range than models predict. We show results incorporating disequilibrium nitrogen
and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of low gravity in planetary mass objects.
Finally, we make predictions for the observability of Y dwarfs and planets with
existing and future instruments, including the James Webb Space Telescope and
Gemini Planet Imager.},

signal-to-noise (∼1800) spectra recorded at room temperature (298.2 K) with the
Bruker IFS 125HR Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the Pacific Northwest

line parameters above 2150 cm−1 were retrieved by simultaneous multispectrum fittings
of all five Bruker spectra, while retrievals with the four Kitt Peak spectra were
done in the 1938–2168 cm−1 range spectrum by spectrum and averaged. In all, positions

conducive for the formation of water and/or ammonia clouds, like Jupiter in the Solar
System. We study the science return from direct-imaging exoplanet missions, focusing
on the exoplanet atmospheric compositions. First, the study shows that a low-resolution (R=70)
reflection spectrum of a giant exoplanet at 600 - 1000 nm, for a moderate signal-to-noise
ratio of 20, will allow measurements of both the pressure of the uppermost cloud
deck and the mixing ratio of methane, if the uppermost cloud deck is located at
the pressure level of 0.6 - 1.5 bars. Further increasing the signal-to-noise ratio
can improve the measurement range of the cloud deck pressure to 0.2 - 4 bars. The
strong and the weak absorption bands of methane allow the simultaneous measurements
of cloud and gas; when the uppermost cloud deck is located shallower than the pressure
level of 0.2, the weak bands are muted, and the cloud deck pressure and the mixing
ratio of methane are not distinguishable from a single reflection spectrum. Second,
future direct-imaging exoplanet missions may detect the broadband reflectivity of
a few super-Earth exoplanets. If having H2O-dominated atmospheres, directly imaged
super Earths are likely to have water clouds located shallower than 1E-3 bars. The
very high clouds on these planets would mute most gas absorption features except
for H2O, and these planets would occupy a confined phase space in the color-color

Our present perception is that brown dwarfs follow the principles of star formation,

has profound implication for their spectral fingerprints. Brown dwarfs cover a
range of effective temperatures which cause brown dwarfs atmospheres to be a sequence
that gradually changes from a M-dwarf-like spectrum into a planet-like spectrum.
This further implies that below an effective temperature of \lesssim 2,800 K,
clouds form already in atmospheres of objects marking the boundary between M-Dwarfs
and brown dwarfs. Recent developments have sparked the interest in plasma processes
in such very cool atmospheres: sporadic and quiescent radio emission has been

This allowed for multiple imaging detections of the companions and multiple extractions
of low-resolution (R ~ 35) spectra. Data reduction employed two different methods
of speckle suppression and spectrum extraction, both yielding results that agree.
The spectra do not directly correspond to those of any known objects, although
similarities with L and T dwarfs are present, as well as some characteristics
similar to planets such as Saturn. We tentatively identify the presence of CH4
along with NH3 and/or C2H2, and possibly CO2 or HCN in varying amounts in each
component of the system. Other studies suggested red colors for these faint companions,
and our data confirm those observations. Cloudy models, based on previous photometric
observations, may provide the best explanation for the new data presented here.
Notable in our data is that these presumably co-eval objects of similar luminosity
have significantly different spectra; the diversity of planets may be greater
than previously thought. The techniques and methods employed in this paper represent
a new capability to observe and rapidly characterize exoplanetary systems in a
routine manner over a broad range of planet masses and separations. These are the

abstract = {In the effort to characterize the masses, radii, and atmospheres of
potentially habitable exoplanets, there is an urgent need to find examples of such
planets transiting nearby M dwarfs. The MEarth Project is an ongoing effort to do
so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect exoplanets as small
as 2 R ⊕ transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately,
identifying transits of such planets in photometric monitoring is complicated both
by the intrinsic stellar variability that is common among these stars and by the
nocturnal cadence, atmospheric variations, and instrumental systematics that often
plague Earth-bound observatories. Here, we summarize the properties of MEarth data
gathered so far, emphasizing the challenges they present for transit detection.
We address these challenges with a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits
in wiggly and irregularly spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods
that clean trends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework
assesses the significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling
variability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our
Method for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability
of a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian
approach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters of
this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters into
its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual transits
processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates and compare
our results to the popular box-fitting least-squares method with simulations. By
applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth Project, we demonstrate the
utility of this framework for robustly assessing the false alarm probability of
transit signals in real data.},

interior compositions of super-Earths (exoplanets with masses of 1-10 M ⊕), and
are typically interpreted with planetary interior models that assume Earth-centric
oxygen-rich compositions. Using such models, the super-Earth 55 Cancri e (mass 8
M ⊕, radius 2 R ⊕) has been suggested to bear an interior composition consisting
of Fe, silicates, and an envelope (gsim 10% by mass) of supercritical water. We
report that the mass and radius of 55 Cancri e can also be explained by a carbon-rich
solid interior made of Fe, C, SiC, and/or silicates and without a volatile envelope.
While the data allow Fe mass fractions of up to 40%, a wide range of C, SiC, and/or
silicate mass fractions are possible. A carbon-rich 55 Cancri e is also plausible
if its protoplanetary disk bore the same composition as its host star, which has
been reported to be carbon-rich. However, more precise estimates of the stellar
elemental abundances and observations of the planetary atmosphere are required to
further constrain its interior composition. The possibility of a C-rich interior

molecular arc and the elevated 12CO (J = 2-1)/(J = 1-0) ratios along the SNR

association places the SNR at a kinematic distance of 4.8 kpc. The X-rays arising
from the northeastern radio shell are emitted by underionized hot (~1.5 keV),
low-density (~0.1 cm–3) plasma with solar abundance, and the plasma may be of

hot-Jupiter's atmosphere for which spectroscopic data are available in the near-IR.
The spectrum shows the presence of water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4), and carbon
dioxide (CO2), and suggests the possible presence of carbon monoxide (CO). We
show that the published IRAC secondary transit emission photometric data are
compatible with the atmospheric composition at the terminator determined from
the NICMOS spectrum, with a range of possible mixing ratios and thermal profiles;
additional emission spectroscopy data are needed to reduce the degeneracy of the
possible solutions. Finally, we note the similarity between the 1.2-1.8 μm transmission
spectra of XO-1b and HD 209458b, suggesting that in addition to having similar
stellar/orbital and planetary parameters the two systems may also have a similar
exoplanetary atmospheric composition.},

medium (R ~ 2000) and high (R ~ 20,000) resolutions with NIRSPEC on the Keck II

with the PHOENIX model atmosphere code. Using multi-dimensional least-squares
fitting and Monte Carlo routines we determine the best-fit model parameters for
each observed spectrum and note which spectral regions provide consistent results.
We identify successes in the reproduction of observed features by atmospheric
models, including pressure-broadened K I lines, and investigate deficiencies in
the models, particularly missing FeH opacity, that will need to be addressed in
order to extend our analysis to cooler objects. The precision that can be obtained
for each parameter using medium- and high-resolution near-infrared spectra is
estimated and the implications for future studies of very low mass stars and

broader spectral range; (b) direct incorporation of thermal infrared opacities

spectroscopic line database to allow direct comparison between these two gas giants.
The results suggest striking similarities between the tropospheric dynamics in
the 100–1000 mbar regions of the giant planets: both demonstrate enhanced PH3 at
the equator, depletion over neighbouring equatorial belts and mid-latitude belt/zone
structures. Saturn's polar PH3 shows depletion within the hot cyclonic polar vortices.
Jovian aerosol distributions are consistent with previous independent studies, and
on Saturn we demonstrate that CIRS spectra are most consistent with a haze in the
100–400 mbar range with a mean optical depth of 0.1 at 10 μm. Unlike Jupiter,
Saturn's tropospheric haze shows a hemispherical asymmetry, being more opaque
in the southern summer hemisphere than in the north. Thermal-IR haze opacity is
not enhanced at Saturn's equator as it is on Jupiter. Small-scale perturbations
to the mean PH3 abundance are discussed both in terms of a model of meridional
overturning and parameterisation as eddy mixing. The large-scale structure of the
PH3 distributions is likely to be related to changes in the photochemical lifetimes
and the shielding due to aerosol opacities. On Saturn, the enhanced summer opacity
results in shielding and extended photochemical lifetimes for PH3, permitting
elevated PH3 levels over Saturn's summer hemisphere.},

(4 GHz coverage) of the new EMIR receptors to sample the expected very large
absorption line (FWHM 20 GHz). The observational strategy has consisted in several
receiver tunings over 250-290 GHz. This technique has been used successfully in
the past to measure the broad CO (FWHM 4 GHz) absorption line in Neptune at the 30m
telescope (Lellouch etal 2005). In a preliminary data reduction analysis, there
is no evidence of broad absorption line on both planets, impliying an upper limit
of about 0.1 times the solar P/H value, much less than expected.

abstract = {Context: Previous works have demonstrated that the generation of secondary
CMB anisotropies due to the molecular optical depth is likely too small to be
observed. In this paper, we examine additional ways in which primordial chemistry
and the dark ages might influence the CMB. Aims: We seek a detailed understanding
of the formation of molecules in the postrecombination universe and their interactions
with the CMB. We present a detailed and updated chemical network and an overview
of the interactions of molecules with the CMB. Methods: We calculate the evolution
of primordial chemistry in a homogeneous universe and determine the optical depth
due to line absorption, photoionization and photodissociation, and estimate the
resulting changes in the CMB temperature and its power spectrum. Corrections for
stimulated and spontaneous emission are taken into account. Results: The most
promising results are obtained for the negative hydrogen ion H- and the HeH+ molecule.
The free-free process of H- yields a relative change in the CMB temperature of
up to 2×10-11, and leads to a frequency-dependent change in the power spectrum
of the order 10-7 at 30 GHz. With a change of the order 10-10 in the power spectrum,
our result for the bound-free process of H- is significantly below a previous
suggestion. HeH+ efficiently scatters CMB photons and smears out primordial fluctuations,
leading to a change in the power spectrum of the order 10-8. Conclusions: We
demonstrate that primordial chemistry does not alter the CMB during the dark ages
of the universe at the significance level of current CMB experiments. We determine
and quantify the essential effects that may contribute to changes in the CMB and
leave an imprint from the dark ages, thus constituting a potential probe of the
early universe.},

exoplanet HD 209458b}},
journal = AA,
year = {2008},

pages = {357-362},
abstract = {The first detection of an atmosphere around an extrasolar planet was
presented by Charbonneau and collaborators in 2002. In the optical transmission
spectrum of the transiting exoplanet HD 209458b, an absorption signal from sodium
was measured at a level of 0.023 ± 0.006%, using the STIS spectrograph on the
Hubble Space Telescope. Despite several attempts, so far only upper limits to
the Na D  absorption have been obtained using telescopes from the ground, and the
HST result has yet to be confirmed. Aims. The aims of this paper are to re-analyse
data taken with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru telescope, to correct
for systematic effects dominating the data quality, and to improve on previous
results presented in the literature. Methods. The data reduction process was altered
in several places, most importantly allowing for small shifts in the wavelength
solution. The relative depth of all lines in the spectra, including the two sodium
D lines, are found to correlate strongly with the continuum count level in the
spectra. These variations are attributed to non-linearity effects in the CCDs.
After removal of this empirical relation the uncertainties in the line depths
are only a fraction above that expected from photon statistics. Results. The
sodium absorption due to the planet's atmosphere is detected at > 5σ, at a level
of 0.056±0.007% (2 3.0 Å band), 0.070±0.011% (2 1.5 Å band), and 0.135 ±0.017%
(2 0.75 Åband). There is no evidence that the planetary absorption signal is
shifted with respect to the stellar absorption, as recently claimed for HD 189733b.
Conclusions. The STIS/HST measurements are confirmed. The measurements of the Na 
D absorption in the two most narrow bands indicate that some signal is being resolved.
Due to variations in the instrumental resolution and intrinsic variations in the
stellar lines due to the Rossiter-McLauglin effect, it will be challenging to probe
the planetary absorption on spectral scales smaller than the stellar absorption
using conventional transmission spectroscopy.},

self-consistently include the formation of condensate clouds. Overall, the model
spectra fit the data well, although the agreement at some wavelengths remains
poor due to remaining inadequacies in the models. Derived effective temperatures
decrease steadily through the L1-T4.5 spectral types, and we confirm that the
effective temperatures of ultracool dwarfs at the L/T transition are nearly constant,
decreasing by only ~200 K from spectral types L7.5 to T4.5. The condensate cloud
properties vary significantly among the L dwarfs in our sample, ranging from very
thick clouds to relatively thin clouds with no particular trend with spectral type.
The two objects in our sample with very red J − Ks colors are, however, best fitted
with synthetic spectra that have thick clouds, which hints at a possible correlation
between the near-infrared colors of L dwarfs and the condensate cloud properties.
The fits to the two T dwarfs in our sample (T2 and T4.5) also suggest that the
clouds become thinner in this spectral class, in agreement with previous studies.
Restricting the fits to narrower wavelength ranges (i.e., individual photometric
bands) almost always yields excellent agreement between the data and models.
Limitations in our knowledge of the opacities of key absorbers such as FeH, VO,
and CH4 at certain wavelengths remain obvious, however. The effective temperatures
obtained by fitting the narrower wavelength ranges can show a large scatter compared
to the values derived by fitting the full spectral energy distributions; deviations
are typically ~200 K and, in the worst cases, up to 700 K.},

abstract = {We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius
relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron,
silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships
for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic
functional form that is not a simple power law: log10 Rs = k1 + img2.giflog10(Ms) -
k2Mimg4.gif for up to Mp ≈ 20 M⊕, where Ms and Rs are scaled mass and radius values.
This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all
have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the
form ρ = ρ0 + cPn. We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including
temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet
bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no
substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional
uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets
composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed
compositions; with ~5% uncertainty water ice planets with gsim25% water by mass
may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of
a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those
of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations
of state. We propose a definition of "super-Earths" based on the clear distinction
in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.},

Earth’s coldest, driest, and most southerly Antarctic biosphere. Matrix-bound
phosphine (MBP) was found in sea animal guanos, ornithogenic sediments and soils.
Phosphine concentrations varied with different sea animal guanos. Average phosphine
concentrations in empire penguin, gentoo penguin, sea lion, skua and gull guanos
were 2.54 ± 1.28 ng kg−1, 6.21 ± 2.15 ng kg−1, 9.12 ± 4.66 ng kg−1, 11.90 ± 1.29
ng kg−1 and 14.55 ± 6.74 ng kg−1, respectively. The contents of phosphorus in these
various matrixes have an important effect on MBP concentrations. The levels of
phosphine appeared an increasing tendency with the content of TP, IP and OP in
sea animal guanos, ornithogenic sediments or soils. The correlation between PH3
and Fe, Mn, Al in these matrixes was also analyzed and discussed. Phosphine showed
an obviously positive correlation with Fe in sea animal guanos. However, excessively
high Fe, Al and Mn may inhibit the formation of PH3 in the ornithogenic soils or

These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L-band

spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to ~0.6 μm. Prominent atomic and molecular
absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Na,

late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0-0 band of
the A 4Π-X 4Σ- transition of VO at ~1.06 μm in the spectra of L dwarfs and the P-
and R-branches of the ν3 band of CH4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf. The equivalent
widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type
and are absent by a spectral type of ~L0, except for the 1.189 μm Fe I line, which
persists to at least ~L3. We compute the bolometric luminosities of the dwarfs in
our sample with measured parallaxes and find good agreement with previously published
results that use L'-band photometry to account for the flux emitted from 2.5 to 3.6 μm.
Finally, 2MASS J2224381-0158521 (L4.5) has an anomalously red spectrum and the
strongest Δν = +2 CO bands in our sample. This may be indicative of unusually thick

Then we review the phosphorus distribution in different cosmic sites, such as
terrestrial planets, interplanetary dust particles, cometary dust, planetary atmospheres
and the interstellar medium (ISM). In this way we realize that this element is
both scarce and ubiquitous in the universe. These features can be related to the
complex nucleosynthesis of P nuclide in the cores of massive stars under explosive
conditions favouring a wide distribution of this element through the ISM, where it
would be ready to react with other available atoms. A general tendency towards more
oxidized phosphorus compounds is clearly appreciated as chemical evolution proceeds
from circumstellar and ISM materials to protoplanetary and planetary condensed
matter phases. To conclude we discuss some possible routes allowing for the
incorporation of phosphorus compounds of prebiotic interest during the earlier
stages of solar system formation.},

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are each creating quantitative databases

have been created with both laboratory and remote-sensing applications in mind.
A spectral resolution of ≊0.1 cm<sup>-1</sup> was selected to avoid degrading
sharp spec- tral features, while also realizing that atmospheric broadening typ-
ically limits line widths to 0.1 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Calculated positional (wave-
number, cm<sup>-1</sup>) uncertainty is ≤0.005 cm<sup>-1</sup>, while the 1σ
statistical uncertainty in absorbance values is <2% for most compounds. The latter
was achieved by measuring multiple (typically ≥9) path length–concentration burdens
and fitting a weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12 samples. Though
these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption strengths, and vapor pressures,
the data agree to within experimental uncertainties with only one exception.},

abstract = {The gas phosphine (PH3) is a part of an atmospheric link of the phosphorus
cycle on earth. Phosphine was reported elsewhere to be found worldwide in remote
air samples in the lower troposphere in the low ng/m3 range during the night,
when oxidation is inhibited. But much less phosphine (pg/m3 range) was found
during daylight around noon in this reactive contaminated atmosphere. Here we
found for the first time gaseous phosphine in remote air samples (0.39–2.45 ng/m3, 16
locations) in the high troposphere above the North-Atlantic in November 1995 during
daylight around noontime. The maximum concentration was measured at the highest
altitude of 12,500 m. No night measurements could be conducted to compare day and
night values. The finding of the reactive phosphine under the sunlight in the high
troposphere far from possible terrestric sources is strange. A model experiment
shows that phosphine could possibly survive the daylight much longer at high altitudes
because of a lack of UV-induced oxidants in the clean and dry air. Additional
model experiments indicate that phosphine can easier sustain its mobile gaseous
state in the atmosphere compared to gases like hydrogen sulfide and ammonia which
stick easier to aerosol and are subject to faster washout and return to Earth's surface.
However, the ultimate fate of phosphine is the oxidation to form phosphoric acid
as a low pH agent and as possible condensation nuclei for clouds at very high altitudes.},

theory with all singles and doubles supplemented with quasiperturbative treatment

force constants are evaluated, respectively, with the correlation consistent
polarized valence quadruple zeta cc-pVQZ, core–valence quadruple zeta cc-pCVQZ,
and weighted core–valence quadruple zeta cc-pwCVQZ basis sets. In the latter two
cases, all electrons are correlated to account for the core correlation effects.
Core–valence correlation effect on geometry is found to be significant. By comparing
the cc-pCVQZ and cc-pwCVQZ results with the cc-pVQZ ones, the bond length re is
reduced by 0.0045 or 0.0049 Å and the bond angle θe by 0.07° or 0.06°, respectively.
Cubic and quartic force fields are further determined with the correlation consistent
polarized weighted core–valence triple zeta cc-pwCVTZ basis set. Vibrational analysis
based on second-order perturbation theory is carried out with the calculated force
constants. Computed fundamentals of PH3 agree to better than 4 cm−1 on average with
the experimental data. Spectroscopic constants are also predicted for a number of
symmetric and asymmetric top isotopomers of PH3. With a minor empirical adjustment
of our best force field, agreement of 1 cm−1 between the computed and experimental
fundamentals is found for all isotopomers.},

229B. This spectrum, with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio per spectral
resolution element (gtrsim 30), spans the wavelength range from 0.837 mu m to 5.0
mu m. We identify a total of four different major methane absorption features,
including the fundamental band at 3.3 mu m, at least four steam bands, and two
neutral cesium features. We confirm the recent detection of carbon monoxide (CO)
in excess of what is predicted by thermochemical equilibrium calculations. Carbon
is synthesized into methane in the outer layers of the atmosphere where the
temperature is low. However, in the deeper, hotter layers it is oxidized into CO.
The presence of CO in the observable part of the atmosphere is therefore a sensitive
indicator of vertical flows. The high signal-to-noise ratio in the 1 mu m to 2.5 mu m
region permits us to place constraints on the quantity of dust in the atmosphere
of the brown dwarf. We are unable to reconcile the spectrum with the presence of dust.
The presence of CO but lack of dust may be a clue to the location of the boundaries
of the outer convective region of the atmosphere: The lack of dust may mean that
it is not being conveyed into the photosphere by convection, or that it exists in
patchy clouds. If the dust is not in clouds, but rather sits below the outer
convective region, we estimate that the boundary between convective and inner
radiative layers is between 1250 K and 1600 K, in agreement with recent models.},

We show that observations of a transition object GD 165B can best be explained by

dusty atmosphere is highly opaque due to a large extinction of uniformly distributed
dust, which produces noticeably observable effects in GD 165B. The spectrum of
the genuine brown dwarf Gl 229B recently discovered, however, shows no evidence
for dust. Instead, the observed broadband spectrum of Gl 229B between 0.8 and 10μm
can be explained well by our dust-free model in which the formation of dust is
artificially suppressed. We interpret this fact as evidence of the formation of
dust clouds in cooler brown dwarfs. This cloudy atmosphere may be more transparent
in the inter-cloud region than the gas-dust homogeneous atmosphere, so that the
volatile gas such as CH_4_ dominates the visible atmosphere. Thus limited observations
now available suggest how dust forms in stellar through substellar photospheres;
dust forms first as a gas-dust homogeneous mixture and then as a cloud.},

Abstract = {We present an analytical pair potential for hydrogen fluoride based on
   3284 ab initio points at counterpoise-corrected MP2-R12 and lower levels
   using a large basis set. Empirical refinements are applied through
   comparison of experimental data with solutions of the multidimensional
   nuclear Schrodinger equation and appropriate mixing and scaling of the
   ab initio data. The new potentials are compared to previous dimer
   potential hypersurfaces and spectroscopic data, yielding best estimates
   of 19.1(2) kJ/mol for the dimer dissociation energy D-e and 4.2(2)
   kJ/mol for the electronic hydrogen bond tunneling barrier.},

	A modified symmetric inversion potential is introduced to describe
	the inversion from the minimum C3v arrangement through the D3h transition
	state. Tunneling rates and frequencies are calculated at the Hartree-Fock
	and Moller-Plesset (MP2) level within the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin

	cm-1/0.053 cm-1). The tunneling rate for PH3 suggests that previously
	published values are wrong by orders of magnitude. Correlation effects
	do not change the barriers significantly in accordance with Freed's
	theorem. This has been studied in more detail for BiH3 at the quadratic
	configuration-interaction (QCI) level. Relativistic effects increase
	the barrier height of BiH3 by 81.6 kJ/mol at the QCI level. Nonrelativistic
	and relativistic extended Huckel calculations suggest that the a1
	highest occupied molecular orbital, which is antibonding to the Bi
	6s, relieves part of its antibonding character near equilibrium geometry
	due to the relativistic radial contraction of the 6s orbital and
	hence increases the barrier height. In the planar transition state
	this orbital is a nonbonding a2?. The increasing trend in barrier
	heights from NH3 to BiH3 can be explained by a second-order Jahn-Teller
	distortion of the trigonal planar geometry. Vibrational frequencies

I. The atoms boron through neon and hydrogen}},
journal = JCP,

pages = {1007-1023},
abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations
have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf,
Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from
correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular
correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the
oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions
effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the
functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive
(sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock
calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on
oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe
molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided
by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular
calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon
and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental
energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct
groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets
which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher
groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered.
The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield
99% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though
the latter contains 50% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive
polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94%–97% of the total
(HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

abstract = {The role of phosphorus in limiting organic matter production and in
causing eutrophication has been in the forefront of hydrobiological research
during the past 30–50 yr1–7. Comparing the cycles of major biogenic elements, it
is evident that, with the exception of phosphorus, each of them contains gaseous
substances (for example, CO2, CH4, O2, N2, NH3, H2S and volatile organic sulphur
compounds) which, because of their gaseous state, can leave aquatic systems8–16.
We examined the phosphorus cycle of open-air sewage treatment plants and a deficit
(∼30–45%) in the phosphorus mass balance was found which cannot be explained by
knowledge based on earlier research on this cycle of the hydrosphere. By developing
special sampling and analytical methods, we have shown that gases released from
the sewage treatment plants and from the sediments of shallow (1–2 m deep) waters
contain a reduced, gaseous phosphorus compound: phosphine. According to our
measurements and calculations, about 5g of phosphorus per day was released as
phosphine from an Imhoff tank settling 2,000 m3 per day of raw sewage. Under laboratory
conditions, it was also demonstrated that phosphine is released by bacterial reduction
from a medium containing inorganic phosphorus. The phosphorus content of the medium
decreases by nearly one half. Our results on the metabolic importance of phosphine
formation and release suggest that ∼25–50% of the phosphorus deficit in open-air
sewage treatment plants can be explained by the release of phosphine into the
atmosphere. These results change our understanding of the aquatic phosphorus cycle;
former ideas about the phosphorus budget should be revised.},

	The quadrupole fine structure associated with the absorption transitions

	be made with these molecules having an axis of charge symmetry. These
	assumptions allow one to rotate the coordinate system from the chargesymmetry
	axes to the inertial axes without thereby adding unknown cross derivatives

	second-order perturbations caused by a nearby level of different
	symmetry but of the same J. This perturbation involves the cross
	derivatives which had previously been assumed to be zero. With the
	assumption of cross derivatives approximately one percent of the
	diagonal terms, the theory fitted experiment within the experimental
	error. The electric quadrupole interaction in arsine and stibine
