Pages = {47-56},
Abstract = {{The valence internally contracted multireference
   configuration-interaction (icMRCI) method is used to compute potential
   energy curves (PECs) of the X-1 Sigma(+), A(1)Pi, C-1 Sigma(-), D-1
   Delta, 2(1)Pi, a(3)Sigma(+), b(3)Pi, d(3)Delta, e(3)Sigma(-), 2(3)Delta,
   2(3)Sigma(-), 1(5)Sigma(+) and 1(5)Pi states for PN, together with the
   Davidson, core-valence (CV) and scalar relativistic corrections, as well
   as the basis-set extrapolation. Transition dipole moments (TDMs) of
   fifteen dipole-allowed transitions between the thirteen states are
   calculated by the icMRCI approach with the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. The
   vibrational band origins, Einstein coefficients and Franck-Condon
   factors of all spontaneous emissions for the fifteen band systems are
   determined, seeking to theoretically predict the strong emissions at
   least of the order of 10(3) s(-1) for Einstein coefficients. Comparing
   with experimental measurements, our calculations can well reproduce the
   band origins and Franck-Condon factors of the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+)
   system. Similar accuracy is assumed for the other band systems. Many
   emissions for the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+), 2(1)Pi-A(1)Pi, 2(1)Pi-X-1
   Sigma(+), 2(1)Pi-C-1 Sigma(-), 2(1)Pi-D-1 Delta, b(3)Pi-a(3)Sigma(+),
   e(3)Sigma(-)-b(3)Pi, 2(3)Delta-1(3)Delta, 2(3)Sigma(-)-1(3)Sigma(-),
   2(3)Sigma(-)-b(3)Pi and 1(5)Pi-1(5)Sigma(+) systems are found to be
   strong according to our calculated Einstein coefficients, whereas the
   emissions are weak for the 2(3)Delta-b(3)Pi system. Radiative lifetimes
   for the first 15 vibrational levels are evaluated to be about tens of
   nanoseconds for the 2(1)Pi state, about several hundred nanoseconds for
   the A(1)Pi state, about several to tens of microseconds for the b(3)Pi,
   2(3)Delta, 2(3)Sigma(-) and 1(5)Pi states and about several to several
   hundred microseconds for the e(3)Sigma(-) state. The results can be used
   as guidelines for line identification and diagnostics of astrophysical
   plasma. (}},

   intensities generally agreed well with Franck-Condon factor
   calculations. In the N-atom reaction the emission arises from the well
   known A (1) Pi-X(1) Sigma(+) system of PN in vibrational levels up to v'
   = 8. Approximate thermodynamic values show that the P-2 emission may
   well arise from the primary step of the reaction, but that the PN

Abstract = {CI calculations have been performed on the A 1PI and 1DELTA states of PN
   in the vicinity of their respective equilibrium geometries, yielding
   spectroscopic constants (r(e), k(e), omega(e), omega(e)x(e), etc) in
   good agreement with the available experimental data. The 1DELTA state,
   which is unknown experimentally, is predicted to lie less than 500 cm-1
   above the 1PI state and 40 345 cm-1 above the 1SIGMA+ ground state.
   Theoretical vibrational bands for the A 1PI --> X 1SIGMA+ transition
   were computed, along with the corresponding Franck-Condon factors. The
   calculated vibrational transitions agree quite well with the observed
   values while the Franck-Condon factors compare favourably with those
   calculated semiempirically from observed vibrational transition
   probabilities. The sequence of absolute radiative intensities for the
   rovibrational (j' = 4) bands \textbackslash{}upsilon', upsilon'')], i.e.
   \textbackslash{}(0,0)]\textbackslash{}(1,0)]\textbackslash{}(2,1)]\textb
   ackslash{}(3,2)]1\textbackslash{}(4,3)], cannot be confirmed
   experimentally because of the perturbation of nearby states on low-lying
   1PI vibrational states (upsilon' = 0-4). Spontaneous radiative and
   non-radiative lifetimes derived according to two decay mechanisms-a
   cascade (A 1PI state being `isolated') mechanism and an electric dipolar
   transition mechanism-show that the latter mode of decay is several
   orders of magnitude larger. The single experimentally known lifetime
   value, i.e. for upsilon' = 0, issued from this decay mode agrees
   reasonably well with the calculated value.
   For the 1DELTA --> A 1PI transition, the electric dipolar decay is only
   slightly favoured with respect to the cascade mode. The lifetimes
   computed for both decay modes are found to be close to those in the
   valence isoelectronic CO molecule. Other miscellaneous observables,
   which to date have not been determined experimentally for these excited
   states, including pure rotational, pure vibrational and rovibrational
   transitions, selected one-electron properties and average values of the
   electric dipole moment over the first few vibrational levels (upsilon =
   0-5) are likewise reported.},

   The PN line has been detected toward the two shocked regions (B1 and B2)
   caused by the interaction between the blue lobe of the outflow from the
   protostar IRAS 20386+6751 and the ambient gas, whereas it has not been
   detected toward the protostar position. The fractional abundances of PN
   relative to H-2 are evaluated to be (2-6) x 10(-10) and (3-7) x 10(-10)
   toward B1 and B2, respectively. Detection of PN in the B1 and B2
   positions indicates that the formation of PN can be triggered by shocks.
   It seems most likely that PN is formed in the gas phase from PH3
   evaporated from grain mantles, as suggested by the existing chemical
   model.},

Abstract = {We have conducted a spectral line survey of the 3 mm band with the 45 m
   telescope of Nobeyama Radio Observatory toward the L 1157 B1 shocked
   region, where the blue-shifted component of the bipolar outflow from the
   protostar IRAS 20386+6751 interacts with the ambient gas. The observed
   frequency ranges from 78.1 to 115.8 GHz. We have detected 129 spectral
   lines of 29 molecular species. In addition to various oxygen-bearing
   organic molecules such as CH3CHO, HCOOCH3, and HCOOH, we have detected a
   phosphorus-containing molecule PN, a nitrogen-bearing organic molecule
   NH2CHO, and a carbon-chain molecule CCS in the shocked region. These
   results clearly indicate that the L 1157 B1 shocked region is chemically
   rich, which is probably triggered by evaporation of grain mantles.},

Abstract = {The chemical mechanism of the (1)PN formation was successfully studied
   by using the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory. The (1)NH(3) +
   (3)PH and (4)P + NH(3) reaction paths are not energetically favorable to
   form the (1)PN molecule. However, the (3)NH + (3)PH, (4)N + (3)PH(3),
   (4)N + (3)PH, (4)P + (3)NH, and (4)P + (2)NH(2) reaction paths to form
   the (1)PN molecule are only energetically favorable by taking place
   through specific transition states to form the (1)PN molecule. The NH(3)
   + (3)PH, (4)N + (1)PH(3), NH(3) + (4)P, and (4)N + (2)PH(2) reactions
   are spin-forbidden and the probability of hopping for these reactions
   was estimated to be 0 by the Landau-Zener theory. This is the first
   detailed study on the chemical mechanism for the (1)PN formation. (C)

Title = {Constraining phosphorus chemistry in carbon- and oxygen-rich
   circumstellar envelopes: Observations of PN, HCP, and CP},
Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {Millimeter-wave observations of PN, CP, and HCP have been carried out
   toward circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars using the Arizona Radio
   Observatory (ARO). HCP and PN have been identified in the carbon-rich
   source CRL 2688 via observations at 1 mm using the Submillimeter
   Telescope (SMT) and 2-3 mm with the Kitt Peak 12 m. An identical set of
   measurements were carried out toward IRC + 10216, as well as
   observations of CP at 1 mm. PN was also observed toward VY Canis Majoris
   (VY CMa), an oxygen-rich supergiant star. The PN and HCP line profiles
   in CRL 2688 and IRC + 10216 are roughly flat topped, indicating
   unresolved, optically thin emission; CP, in contrast, has a distinct
   ``U{''} shape in IRC + 10216. Modeling of the line profiles suggests
   abundances, relative to H(2), of f (PN) similar to (3-5) x 10(-9) and f
   (HCP) similar to 2 x 10(-7) in CRL 2688, about an order of magnitude
   higher than in IRC + 10216. In VY CMa, f(PN) is similar to 4 x 10(-8).
   The data in CRL 2688 and IRC + 10216 are consistent with LTE formation
   of HCP and PN in the inner envelope, as predicted by theoretical
   calculations, with CP a photodissociation product at larger radii. The
   observed abundance of PN in VY CMa is a factor of 100 higher than LTE
   predictions. In IRC + 10216, the chemistry of HCP/CP mimics that of
   HCN/CN and suggests an N(2) abundance of f similar to 1 x 10(-7). The
   chemistry of phosphorus appears active in both carbon-and oxygen-rich
   envelopes of evolved stars.},

Title = {Rotational excitation and de-excitation of PN molecules by He atoms},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {468},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1123-1127},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Context. Observations of molecular emission at millimeter and infrared
   wavelengths, supplemented by careful and detailed modeling, are powerful
   tools for investigating the physical and chemical conditions of
   astrophysical objects. Modeling of molecular emission requires the
   calculation of rates for excitation by collisions with the most abundant
   species.
   Aims. The present paper focuses on the calculation of rate coefficients
   for rotational excitation of the PN molecule in its ground vibrational
   state in collision with He, based on a new two-dimensional potential
   energy surface from highly correlated ab initio calculations.
   Methods. Calculations of pure rotational (de) excitation of PN by He
   were performed for the first rotational levels using the essentially
   exact close-coupling method for the lower levels and the coupled-states
   approximation for higher levels.
   Results. Cross sections for transitions among the 31 first rotational
   levels of PN were calculated for kinetic energies up to 2500 cm(-1).
   These cross sections were used to determine collisional rate constants
   for temperatures ranging from 5 K to 300 K. A propensity for even Delta
   j transitions is observed, which reflects the nearly symmetric character
   of the PN-He potential energy surface.},

  abstract={Phosphorus is a crucial element for the development of life, but so far P-bearing molecules have been detected only in a few astrophysical objects; hence, its interstellar chemistry is almost totally unknown. Here, we show new detections of phosphorus nitride (PN) in a sample of dense cores in different evolutionary stages of the intermediate- and high-mass star formation process: starless, with protostellar objects, and with ultracompact H ii regions. All detected PN line widths are smaller than 
   5 km s-1 , and they arise from regions associated with kinetic temperatures smaller than 100 K. Because the few previous detections reported in the literature are associated with warmer and more turbulent sources, the results of this work show that PN can arise from relatively quiescent and cold gas. This information is challenging for theoretical models that invoke either high desorption temperatures or grain sputtering from shocks to release phosphorus into the gas phase. Derived column densities are of the 
order of 10 1112 cm -2 , marginally lower than the values derived in the few high-mass star-forming regions detected so far. New constraints on the abundance of phosphorus monoxide, the fundamental unit of biologically relevant molecules, are also given.}
