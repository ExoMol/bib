Title = {A theoretical study on the electronically excited-state spectroscopic
   properties of phosphorus nitride},
Journal = MP,
Abstract = {The potential energy curves of 103 Omega states generated from the 39
   Lambda-S states of PN have been calculated using the internally
   contracted multireference configuration interaction method with the
   Davidson modification. Core-valence correlation and scalar relativistic
   corrections, as well as the basis-set extrapolation to the complete
   basis set limit are considered. The spin-orbit coupling is computed
   using the state interaction approach with the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian.
   The spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants of bound and
   quasibound Lambda-S and Omega states are evaluated. Our calculated
   spectroscopic results agree quite well with the available experimental
   data. The interactions among different electronic states in curve
   crossing regions have been discussed with the help of computed
   spin-orbit coupling matrix elements. The perturbations and
   predissociation phenomena of the A(1)Pi, b(3)Pi, D-1 Delta, E-1
   Sigma(+), and 2(1)Pi states and so on have been revealed.},

Pages = {47-56},
Abstract = {The valence internally contracted multireference
   configuration-interaction (icMRCI) method is used to compute potential
   energy curves (PECs) of the X-1 Sigma(+), A(1)Pi, C-1 Sigma(-), D-1

   2(3)Sigma(-), 1(5)Sigma(+) and 1(5)Pi states for PN, together with the
   Davidson, core-valence (CV) and scalar relativistic corrections, as well
   as the basis-set extrapolation. Transition dipole moments (TDMs) of
   fifteen dipole-allowed transitions between the thirteen states are
   calculated by the icMRCI approach with the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. The
   vibrational band origins, Einstein coefficients and Franck-Condon
   factors of all spontaneous emissions for the fifteen band systems are
   determined, seeking to theoretically predict the strong emissions at
   least of the order of 10(3) s(-1) for Einstein coefficients. Comparing
   with experimental measurements, our calculations can well reproduce the
   band origins and Franck-Condon factors of the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+)
   system. Similar accuracy is assumed for the other band systems. Many
   emissions for the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+), 2(1)Pi-A(1)Pi, 2(1)Pi-X-1
   Sigma(+), 2(1)Pi-C-1 Sigma(-), 2(1)Pi-D-1 Delta, b(3)Pi-a(3)Sigma(+),

   2(3)Sigma(-)-b(3)Pi and 1(5)Pi-1(5)Sigma(+) systems are found to be
   strong according to our calculated Einstein coefficients, whereas the
   emissions are weak for the 2(3)Delta-b(3)Pi system. Radiative lifetimes
   for the first 15 vibrational levels are evaluated to be about tens of
   nanoseconds for the 2(1)Pi state, about several hundred nanoseconds for
   the A(1)Pi state, about several to tens of microseconds for the b(3)Pi,
   2(3)Delta, 2(3)Sigma(-) and 1(5)Pi states and about several to several
   hundred microseconds for the e(3)Sigma(-) state. The results can be used
   as guidelines for line identification and diagnostics of astrophysical plasma.},

We hope these molecules may be able to act as precursors for many phosphorus containing prebiotic molecules. We have also found that many isomers have the signature N-N linkage and suggest that they can be viewed as potential candidates as reservoir for the N-2 in interstellar medium. Also, we have shown how unlike the N2 which has very large dissociation energy and zero dipole moment; its analogue NP shows some interesting chemistry owing to its comparatively low dissociation energy and small dipole moment.

pages = {L30},
abstract = {Phosphorus is a crucial element for the development of life, but so
far P-bearing molecules have been detected only in a few astrophysical objects;
hence, its interstellar chemistry is almost totally unknown. Here, we show new
detections of phosphorus nitride (PN) in a sample of dense cores in different
evolutionary stages of the intermediate- and high-mass star formation process:
starless, with protostellar objects, and with ultracompact H ii regions. All detected
PN line widths are smaller than 5 km s-1 , and they arise from regions associated
with kinetic temperatures smaller than 100 K. Because the few previous detections
reported in the literature are associated with warmer and more turbulent sources,
the results of this work show that PN can arise from relatively quiescent and cold
gas. This information is challenging for theoretical models that invoke either high
desorption temperatures or grain sputtering from shocks to release phosphorus into
the gas phase. Derived column densities are of the order of 10 11Â–12 cm -2 , marginally
lower than the values derived in the few high-mass star-forming regions detected
so far. New constraints on the abundance of phosphorus monoxide, the fundamental
unit of biologically relevant molecules, are also given.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {684},
Pages = {618-625},
Abstract = {Millimeter-wave observations of PN, CP, and HCP have been carried out
   toward circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars using the Arizona Radio
   Observatory (ARO). HCP and PN have been identified in the carbon-rich
   source CRL 2688 via observations at 1 mm using the Submillimeter
   Telescope (SMT) and 2-3 mm with the Kitt Peak 12 m. An identical set of
   measurements were carried out toward IRC + 10216, as well as
   observations of CP at 1 mm. PN was also observed toward VY Canis Majoris
   (VY CMa), an oxygen-rich supergiant star. The PN and HCP line profiles
   in CRL 2688 and IRC + 10216 are roughly flat topped, indicating
   unresolved, optically thin emission; CP, in contrast, has a distinct
   ``U{''} shape in IRC + 10216. Modeling of the line profiles suggests
   abundances, relative to H(2), of f (PN) similar to (3-5) x 10(-9) and f
   (HCP) similar to 2 x 10(-7) in CRL 2688, about an order of magnitude
   higher than in IRC + 10216. In VY CMa, f(PN) is similar to 4 x 10(-8).
   The data in CRL 2688 and IRC + 10216 are consistent with LTE formation
   of HCP and PN in the inner envelope, as predicted by theoretical
   calculations, with CP a photodissociation product at larger radii. The
   observed abundance of PN in VY CMa is a factor of 100 higher than LTE
   predictions. In IRC + 10216, the chemistry of HCP/CP mimics that of
   HCN/CN and suggests an N(2) abundance of f similar to 1 x 10(-7). The
   chemistry of phosphorus appears active in both carbon-and oxygen-rich
   envelopes of evolved stars.},

Volume = {468},
Pages = {1123-1127},
Abstract = {Context. Observations of molecular emission at millimeter and infrared
   wavelengths, supplemented by careful and detailed modeling, are powerful
   tools for investigating the physical and chemical conditions of
   astrophysical objects. Modeling of molecular emission requires the
   calculation of rates for excitation by collisions with the most abundant
   species.
   Aims. The present paper focuses on the calculation of rate coefficients
   for rotational excitation of the PN molecule in its ground vibrational
   state in collision with He, based on a new two-dimensional potential
   energy surface from highly correlated ab initio calculations.
   Methods. Calculations of pure rotational (de) excitation of PN by He
   were performed for the first rotational levels using the essentially
   exact close-coupling method for the lower levels and the coupled-states
   approximation for higher levels.
   Results. Cross sections for transitions among the 31 first rotational
   levels of PN were calculated for kinetic energies up to 2500 cm(-1).
   These cross sections were used to determine collisional rate constants
   for temperatures ranging from 5 K to 300 K. A propensity for even Delta
   j transitions is observed, which reflects the nearly symmetric character
   of the PN-He potential energy surface.},

   cascade (A 1PI state being `isolated') mechanism and an electric dipolar
   transition mechanism-show that the latter mode of decay is several
   orders of magnitude larger. The single experimentally known lifetime
   value, i.e. for upsilon' = 0, issued from this decay mode agrees
   reasonably well with the calculated value.
   For the 1DELTA --> A 1PI transition, the electric dipolar decay is only
   slightly favoured with respect to the cascade mode. The lifetimes
   computed for both decay modes are found to be close to those in the
   valence isoelectronic CO molecule. Other miscellaneous observables,
   which to date have not been determined experimentally for these excited

a search for HPO, HCP, and PH3 in interstellar and circumstellar sources. The
results are consistent with previously developed ion-molecule models of phosphorus
chemistry and imply large depletion factors for P in dense clouds: about 1000 in
warm star-forming cores and more than 10,000 in cold cloud cores. Thermochemical
equilibrium models have been developed for the P chemistry in C-rich and O-rich

with the recent detection of CP, implies significant depletion of HCP onto grains.
Depletion factors for first- and second-row elements in diffuse and dense interstellar
clouds are summarized, and an overall picture of circumstellar and interstellar grain
and gas-phase processes is proposed to explain the depletions of N, O, C, S, Si, P,

abstract = {Gaseous PN and SiS have been prepared at high temperatures from P3N5
and from CS2 + Si respectively, and the species have been trapped in krypton matrices
at 10°K. Infrared studies using P14N and P15N showed matrix isolated PN monomer
and its aggregation to P3N3, a molecule isostructural with Si3O3 with D3h symmetry;
P2N2 was not detected. Both SiS and Si2S2 were detected by i.r. in the SiS/Kr
matrix but no higher polymers could be characterised. The molecular parameters
of SiS and Si2S2 calculated from the infrared data are in line with those for
other matrix isolated Group IV chalcogenides.},
