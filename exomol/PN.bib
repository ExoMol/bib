Abstract = {The valence internally contracted multireference
   configuration-interaction (icMRCI) method is used to compute potential
   energy curves (PECs) of the X-1 Sigma(+), A(1)Pi, C-1 Sigma(-), D-1
   Delta, 2(1)Pi, a(3)Sigma(+), b(3)Pi, d(3)Delta, e(3)Sigma(-), 2(3)Delta,
   2(3)Sigma(-), 1(5)Sigma(+) and 1(5)Pi states for PN, together with the
   Davidson, core-valence (CV) and scalar relativistic corrections, as well
   as the basis-set extrapolation. Transition dipole moments (TDMs) of
   fifteen dipole-allowed transitions between the thirteen states are
   calculated by the icMRCI approach with the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. The
   vibrational band origins, Einstein coefficients and Franck-Condon
   factors of all spontaneous emissions for the fifteen band systems are
   determined, seeking to theoretically predict the strong emissions at
   least of the order of 10(3) s(-1) for Einstein coefficients. Comparing
   with experimental measurements, our calculations can well reproduce the
   band origins and Franck-Condon factors of the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+)
   system. Similar accuracy is assumed for the other band systems. Many
   emissions for the A(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+), 2(1)Pi-A(1)Pi, 2(1)Pi-X-1
   Sigma(+), 2(1)Pi-C-1 Sigma(-), 2(1)Pi-D-1 Delta, b(3)Pi-a(3)Sigma(+),
   e(3)Sigma(-)-b(3)Pi, 2(3)Delta-1(3)Delta, 2(3)Sigma(-)-1(3)Sigma(-),
   2(3)Sigma(-)-b(3)Pi and 1(5)Pi-1(5)Sigma(+) systems are found to be
   strong according to our calculated Einstein coefficients, whereas the
   emissions are weak for the 2(3)Delta-b(3)Pi system. Radiative lifetimes
   for the first 15 vibrational levels are evaluated to be about tens of
   nanoseconds for the 2(1)Pi state, about several hundred nanoseconds for
   the A(1)Pi state, about several to tens of microseconds for the b(3)Pi,
   2(3)Delta, 2(3)Sigma(-) and 1(5)Pi states and about several to several
   hundred microseconds for the e(3)Sigma(-) state. The results can be used
   as guidelines for line identification and diagnostics of astrophysical plasma.},

pages = {L30},
abstract = {Phosphorus is a crucial element for the development of life, but so
far P-bearing molecules have been detected only in a few astrophysical objects;
hence, its interstellar chemistry is almost totally unknown. Here, we show new
detections of phosphorus nitride (PN) in a sample of dense cores in different
evolutionary stages of the intermediate- and high-mass star formation process:
starless, with protostellar objects, and with ultracompact H ii regions. All detected
PN line widths are smaller than 5 km s-1 , and they arise from regions associated
with kinetic temperatures smaller than 100 K. Because the few previous detections
reported in the literature are associated with warmer and more turbulent sources,
the results of this work show that PN can arise from relatively quiescent and cold
gas. This information is challenging for theoretical models that invoke either high
desorption temperatures or grain sputtering from shocks to release phosphorus into
the gas phase. Derived column densities are of the order of 10 1112 cm -2 , marginally
lower than the values derived in the few high-mass star-forming regions detected
so far. New constraints on the abundance of phosphorus monoxide, the fundamental
unit of biologically relevant molecules, are also given.},

   caused by the interaction between the blue lobe of the outflow from the
   protostar IRAS 20386+6751 and the ambient gas, whereas it has not been
   detected toward the protostar position. The fractional abundances of PN
   relative to H-2 are evaluated to be (2-6) x 10(-10) and (3-7) x 10(-10)
   toward B1 and B2, respectively. Detection of PN in the B1 and B2

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {684},
Number = {1},
Pages = {618-625},
Abstract = {Millimeter-wave observations of PN, CP, and HCP have been carried out
   toward circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars using the Arizona Radio
   Observatory (ARO). HCP and PN have been identified in the carbon-rich
   source CRL 2688 via observations at 1 mm using the Submillimeter
   Telescope (SMT) and 2-3 mm with the Kitt Peak 12 m. An identical set of
   measurements were carried out toward IRC + 10216, as well as
   observations of CP at 1 mm. PN was also observed toward VY Canis Majoris
   (VY CMa), an oxygen-rich supergiant star. The PN and HCP line profiles
   in CRL 2688 and IRC + 10216 are roughly flat topped, indicating
   unresolved, optically thin emission; CP, in contrast, has a distinct
   ``U{''} shape in IRC + 10216. Modeling of the line profiles suggests
   abundances, relative to H(2), of f (PN) similar to (3-5) x 10(-9) and f
   (HCP) similar to 2 x 10(-7) in CRL 2688, about an order of magnitude
   higher than in IRC + 10216. In VY CMa, f(PN) is similar to 4 x 10(-8).
   The data in CRL 2688 and IRC + 10216 are consistent with LTE formation
   of HCP and PN in the inner envelope, as predicted by theoretical
   calculations, with CP a photodissociation product at larger radii. The
   observed abundance of PN in VY CMa is a factor of 100 higher than LTE
   predictions. In IRC + 10216, the chemistry of HCP/CP mimics that of
   HCN/CN and suggests an N(2) abundance of f similar to 1 x 10(-7). The
   chemistry of phosphorus appears active in both carbon-and oxygen-rich
   envelopes of evolved stars.},

Journal = AA,

Volume = {468},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1123-1127},
Abstract = {Context. Observations of molecular emission at millimeter and infrared
   wavelengths, supplemented by careful and detailed modeling, are powerful
   tools for investigating the physical and chemical conditions of
   astrophysical objects. Modeling of molecular emission requires the
   calculation of rates for excitation by collisions with the most abundant
   species.
   Aims. The present paper focuses on the calculation of rate coefficients
   for rotational excitation of the PN molecule in its ground vibrational
   state in collision with He, based on a new two-dimensional potential
   energy surface from highly correlated ab initio calculations.
   Methods. Calculations of pure rotational (de) excitation of PN by He
   were performed for the first rotational levels using the essentially
   exact close-coupling method for the lower levels and the coupled-states
   approximation for higher levels.
   Results. Cross sections for transitions among the 31 first rotational
   levels of PN were calculated for kinetic energies up to 2500 cm(-1).
   These cross sections were used to determine collisional rate constants
   for temperatures ranging from 5 K to 300 K. A propensity for even Delta
   j transitions is observed, which reflects the nearly symmetric character
   of the PN-He potential energy surface.},

results are consistent with previously developed ion-molecule models of phosphorus

equilibrium models have been developed for the P chemistry in C-rich and O-rich

abstract = {Phosphorus nitride (PN) has been detected in the interstellar medium.
The J = 2-1, 3-2, 5-4, and 6-5 rotational lines of this species have been observed
toward Orion-KL, and the J = 2-1 transition in Sgr B2 and W51. The PN line profiles
in Orion indicate that the molecule's emission arises from the 'plateau' or 'doughnut'
region associated with the outflow from IRc2. The species is thus primarily present
in hot, dense gas. Column densities derived for PN toward Orion-KL are (3-4) x 10
to the 13th/sq cm, but may be as high as 10 to the 14th/sq cm, if the species is
located in a 10-arcsec region. These column densities imply a fractional abundance
for PN in the Orion 'plateau' of (1-4) x 10 to the -10th. Such a large abundance
for PN is not predicted by quiescent cloud ion-molecule chemistry and suggests that
high-temperature processes are responsible for the synthesis of PN in the KL outflow.},

be surprisingly successful in predicting the 3Δ spin-orbit constant for a series
of isovalent molecules. Semiempirical estimates of the 3Δ and 3Π spin-orbit constants
of AsN are given. The Hartree-Fock values of the a and b perturbation parameters
