Abstract = {Accurate rotational-vibrational line lists for (PN)-P-31-N-14 and
   (PN)-P-31-N-15 in their ground electronic states are computed. The line
   lists are produced using an empirical potential energy curve obtained by
   fitting to the experimental transition frequencies available in the
   literature in conjunction with an accurate, high-level ab initio dipole
   moment curve. In these calculations, the programs DPOTFIT and LEVEL 8.0
   were used. The new line lists reproduce the experimental wavenumbers
   with a root-mean-square error of 0.004 cm(-1). The line lists cover the
   frequency range 0-51 000 cm(-1), contain almost 700 000 lines each and
   extend up to a maximum vibrational level of v = 66 and a maximum
   rotational level of J = 357. They should be applicable for a large range
   of temperatures up to, at least, 5000 K. These new line lists are used
   to simulate spectra for phosphorus nitride at a range of temperatures
   and are deposited in the Strasbourg data centre. This work is performed
   as part of the ExoMol project.},
