Abstract = {In this study, the potential energy function, dipole moment function,
   and transition dipole moment function of the PO+ are computed employing
   high-precision multi-reference configuration interaction methods. By
   solving the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for the nuclei,
   vibrational and rotational energy levels of eight bound states are
   obtained, subsequently enabling the calculation of the partition
   function for the PO+ molecule. Combining the partition function with the
   dipole moment function and transition dipole moment function, spectral
   lines for the PO+ molecule in both the infrared and ultraviolet ranges
   are computed. The spectral lines in the infrared range primarily
   originate from vibrational-rotational transitions associated with the
   X1E+ state, while the spectral lines in the ultraviolet range mainly
   arise from transitions involving the X1E+ H C1N. At 296 K, the most
   intense spectral lines in the infrared range are generated by the 0-0
   vibrational band(v' = 0, v{''} = 0), while the most intense spectral
   lines in the ultraviolet range are produced by the 2-0 vibrational
   band(v' = 2, v{''} = 0). At elevated temperatures, the overall intensity
   of spectral lines decreases as more energy levels are excited, and the
   central positions of spectral peaks undergo shifts. This study
   extensively computed the spectral line data for the PO+ molecule,
   providing crucial data support for astronomical observations.},
