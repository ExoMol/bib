Abstract = {The article presents the results of calculation of vibrational and
   rotational terms of X-2 Pi and B-2 Sigma(+) electronic states of
   phosphorus oxide (PO) molecule. The absorption spectrum corresponding to
   electronic transition B-2 Sigma(+) (nu ` = 0) - X-2 Pi (nu `' = 0) is
   calculated. The efficiency of laser excitation of PO molecules is
   estimated depending on the spectral parameters of radiation. It is
   established that the efficiency of excitation of the electronic
   transition B-2 Sigma(+) (nu ` = 0) - X-2 Pi (nu `' = 0) of PO molecule
   is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of A(2)Sigma(+)
   (nu ` = 0) - X-2 Pi (nu `' = 0) transition. The results are of practical
   importance from the point of view of choosing the optimal scheme for
   laser excitation of fluorescence of PO fragments in remote detection of

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{906}},
Abstract = {{The PO molecule (X-2 pi(r)) has been detected toward Orion-KL via its J
   = 2.5 -> 1.5 transition near 109 GHz using the 12 m telescope of the
   Arizona Radio Observatory. This transition consists of a quartet of
   lines, generated by lambda-doubling and phosphorus hyperfine
   interactions, creating a distinct pattern of doublets of doublets. All
   four features (F = 3 -> 2, e, f and 2 -> 1, e, f ) were detected. The
   line profiles measured were relatively broad, with Delta V-1/2 similar
   to 21-25 km s(-1), and V-LSR similar to 10 km s(-1), clearly identifying
   the molecule as arising from the Orion ``plateau{''} region. The J = 2
   -> 1 transition of PN (X-1 Sigma) at 94 GHz was also measured, and its
   line profile indicates a plateau origin in Orion, as found previously by
   Ziurys. Therefore, PO and PN arise from the same gas. There was no
   evidence of a ``hot core{''} or ``ridge{''} component in either
   molecule. The column densities determined for PO and PN in the Orion
   plateau are N-tot 5.4(0.2) x 10(13) and 2.0(0.4) x 10(13) cm(-2),
   respectively, with corresponding abundances, relative to H-2, of f
   similar to 1.6(0.1) x 10(-10) and 6.1(0.6) x 10(-11), resulting in PO/PN
   similar to 3. The PO and PN line profiles also resemble those of SiO and
   SiS, suggesting that the phosphorus molecules are produced by shocks in
   the plateau outflow. The observed PO/PN ratio in Orion-KL is very close
   in value to that measured in other warm molecular clouds, indicating a
   common synthesis pathway for these two molecules in outflows caused by
   star formation.}},

   grains at the end of the collapse and desorb during the warm-up phase once the

   during a period of ∼5 × 10 4 yr at the early stages of the warm-up phase, when the

   None of these species are detected towards the driving protostar of the outflow

   yields an abundance of 2.5 × 10−9 and 0.9 × 10−9 for PO and PN, respectively. These

   Shock modelling shows that atomic N plays a major role in the chemistry of PO and
   PN. The relative abundance of PO and PN brings constraints both on the duration of
   the pre-shock phase, which has to be ∼106 yr, and on the shock parameters. The

   abstract = {Context. Phosphorus-bearing compounds have only been studied in the
   circumstellar environments of the asymptotic giant branch star IRC + 10 216 and
   the protoplanetary nebula CRL 2688, both carbon-rich objects, and the oxygen-rich
   red supergiant VY CMa. The current chemical models cannot reproduce the high
   abundances of PO and PN derived from observations of VY CMa. No observations have
   been reported of phosphorus in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic
   giant branch stars. Aims. We aim to set observational constraints on the phosphorous
   chemistry in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars,
   by focussing on the Mira-type variable star IK Tau. Methods. Using the IRAM 30m
   telescope and the Submillimeter Array, we observed four rotational transitions
   of PN (J = 2-1, 3-2, 6-5, 7-6) and four of PO (J = 5/2-3/2, 7/2-5/2, 13/2-11/2, 15/2-13/2).
   The IRAM 30m observations were dedicated line observations, while the Submillimeter
   Array data come from an unbiased spectral survey in the frequency range 279-355 GHz.
   Results. We present the first detections of PN and PO in an oxygen-rich asymptotic
   giant branch star and estimate abundances X(PN/H-2) approximate to 3 x 10(-7)
   and X(PO/H-2) in the range 0.5-6.0 x 10(-7). This is several orders of magnitude
   higher than what is found for the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch star IRC + 10 216.
   The diameter (less than or similar to 0.'' 7) of the PN and PO emission distributions
   measured in the interferometric data corresponds to a maximum radial extent of about 40
   stellar radii. The abundances and the spatial occurrence of the molecules are in
   very good agreement with the results reported for VY CMa. We did not detect PS
   or PH3 in the survey. Conclusions. We suggest that PN and PO are the main carriers
   of phosphorus in the gas phase, with abundances possibly up to several 10(-7).
   The current chemical models cannot account for this, underlining the strong need
   for updated chemical models that include phosphorous compounds.},

each of which consisted of well-defined lambda- doublets. The line profiles are
roughly parabolic in shape, analogous to PN, and suggest that this species arises
from the spherical wind in VY CMa, as opposed to the collimated blue- and redshifted
outflows. Comparison of line intensities indicates that PO arises from a confined
source roughly 1'' in extent, with a column density of N-tot similar or equal
to 2.8 x 10(15) cm(-2), which corresponds to a fractional abundance of f similar
to 9 x 10(-8), relative to H-2. Consequently, PO and PN have similar concentrations
in VY CMa, a result not predicted by either LTE or kinetic models of circumstellar

this active envelope. Phosphorus monoxide is the first interstellar molecule detected

In accordance with thermodynamic calculations of photospheric chemistry, we have
assumed that the dominant forms of phosphorus in the inner circumstellar envelope

CP abundance reasonably well if it is the photodaughter of HCP. In the O-rich case
we find, for the same amount of P available in PS, that large abundances of atomic
P are available for reaction but that a low abundance of PO can be produced.
We have not extensively explored the effect of additional neutral processes since
our results are partly compromised by the fact that neither HCP nor PS is detected
in the three CSEs where searches have been made; our models predict column densities
in excess of the published upper limits. Sensitive searches for these molecules
at higher frequencies are required before their presence in circumstellar envelopes
can definitely be ruled out. Dust condensation may incorporate all the available
P into refractory grains and so we suggest that searches for P-bearing molecules
may have the greatest opportunity for success in more evolved objects, such as
protoplanetary nebulae, where P has been released from grains through the action
