  abstract={Phosphorus is a crucial element in biochemistry, in particular the P−O bond, which is key in the formation of the backbone of deoxyribonucleic acid. So far, PO has only been detected toward the envelope of evolved stars, but never toward star-forming regions. We report the first detection of PO toward two massive star-forming regions, W51 e1/e2 and W3(OH), using data from the IRAM 30 m telescope. PN has also been detected toward the two regions. The abundance ratio PO/PN is 1.8 and 3 for W51 and W3(OH), respectively. Our chemical model indicates that the two molecules are chemically related and are formed via gas-phase ion–molecule and neutral–neutral reactions during cold collapse. The molecules freeze out onto grains at the end of the collapse and desorb during the warm-up phase once the temperature reaches ∼35 K. Similar abundances of the two species are expected during a period of ∼5 × 10 4 yr at the early stages of the warm-up phase, when the temperature is in the range 35–90 K. The observed molecular abundances of 10 −10 are predicted by the model if a relatively high initial abundance of 5 × 10 −9 of depleted phosphorus is assumed.}

   abstract = {Context. Phosphorus-bearing compounds have only been studied in the circumstellar environments of the asymptotic giant branch star IRC + 10 216 and the protoplanetary nebula CRL 2688, both carbon-rich objects, and the oxygen-rich red supergiant VY CMa. The current chemical models cannot reproduce the high abundances of PO and PN derived from observations of VY CMa. No observations have been reported of phosphorus in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. Aims. We aim to set observational constraints on the phosphorous chemistry in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, by focussing on the Mira-type variable star IK Tau. Methods. Using the IRAM 30m telescope and the Submillimeter Array, we observed four rotational transitions of PN (J = 2-1, 3-2, 6-5, 7-6) and four of PO (J = 5/2-3/2, 7/2-5/2, 13/2-11/2, 15/2-13/2). The IRAM 30m observations were dedicated line observations, while the Submillimeter Array data come from an unbiased spectral survey in the frequency range 279-355 GHz. Results. We present the first detections of PN and PO in an oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch star and estimate abundances X(PN/H-2) approximate to 3 x 10(-7) and X(PO/H-2) in the range 0.5-6.0 x 10(-7). This is several orders of magnitude higher than what is found for the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch star IRC + 10 216. The diameter (less than or similar to 0.'' 7) of the PN and PO emission distributions measured in the interferometric data corresponds to a maximum radial extent of about 40 stellar radii. The abundances and the spatial occurrence of the molecules are in very good agreement with the results reported for VY CMa. We did not detect PS or PH3 in the survey. Conclusions. We suggest that PN and PO are the main carriers of phosphorus in the gas phase, with abundances possibly up to several 10(-7). The current chemical models cannot account for this, underlining the strong need for updated chemical models that include phosphorous compounds.},

All the PECs are calculated by the CASSCF method, which is followed by the internally contracted MRCI approach with the Davidson modification. The spin-orbit coupling is included by the state interaction approach with the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. The convergent behavior is observed and discussed with respect to the correlation-consistent basis set and level of theory. The effect on the energy splitting by core-electron correlations is studied. To improve the quality of PECs, core-valence correlation corrections are included by a cc-pCVTZ basis set. Scalar relativistic correction calculations are made by the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. All the PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. With these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters of 10 Lambda-S and 16 Omega bound states are evaluated. The vibrational manifolds of the first 16 vibrational states are evaluated for each Lambda-S and Omega state of non-rotation radical. With the PECs obtained by the MRCI+Q/CV+DK+56+SO calculations, the SO coupling splitting energy of X-2 Pi Lambda-S state is determined as 225.18 cm(-1), which agrees well with the measurements of 224.17 cm(-1). Moreover, other spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants calculated here are also in excellent agreement with the available measurements. It shows that the spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants reported here can be expected to be reliable predicted ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The J = 5.5 -> 4.5 and J = 6.5 -> 5.5 rotational transitions of PO at 240 and 284 GHz were observed, each of which consisted of well-defined lambda- doublets. The line profiles are roughly parabolic in shape, analogous to PN, and suggest that this species arises from the spherical wind in VY CMa, as opposed to the collimated blue- and redshifted outflows. Comparison of line intensities indicates that PO arises from a confined source roughly 1'' in extent, with a column density of N-tot similar or equal to 2.8 x 10(15) cm(-2), which corresponds to a fractional abundance of f similar to 9 x 10(-8), relative to H-2. Consequently, PO and PN have similar concentrations in VY CMa, a result not predicted by either LTE or kinetic models of circumstellar chemistry. These phosphorus compounds may arise from shock-induced reactions in this active envelope. Phosphorus monoxide is the first interstellar molecule detected that contains a P-O bond, a moiety essential in biochemical compounds. It is also the first new species to be identified in an oxygen-rich, as opposed to a carbon-rich, circumstellar envelope.},

Attention has been focused on the most stable species that can be formed with the four [C,H,O,P] atoms. Ab initio coupled cluster molecular orbital methods and density functional theory have been used. It is found that the best candidate for detection is singlet \{HPCO\} (corresponding to singlet HNCO), which lies 23.5 kcal/mol lower than the next isomer (HOCP) and has a non-negligible dipole moment of 0.8 D. Theoretical rotational constants and infrared (IR) spectra have been determined for \{HPCO\} and the closely related HPCS. By correcting the known inadequacies in the calculations with the average theoretical to experimental ratio from two benchmark molecules (HOCO+ and HNCO), it is possible to obtain rotational constants and \{IR\} frequencies of considerably higher accuracy. The corrected values of B=5.5322 \{GHz\} and C=5.4071 \{GHz\} for HPCO, and B=3.0416 \{GHz\} and C=3.0014 \{GHz\} for \{HPCS\} should be accurate to within a few tenths of a percent. It can also be predicted that only the 2000 cm−1 (HPCO) and 1400 cm−1 (HPCS) \{IR\} bands have sufficient intensity to be searched in the low-abundance conditions prevailing in space. }
