abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations on the low-lying electronic states of PS correlating with the lowest four dissociation limits are performed by utilizing the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction method (icMRCI) with all-electron Gaussian basis sets. The potential energy curves (PECs) and spectroscopic constants of low-lying bound states are computed. It is of interest to compare the spectroscopic constants of low-lying bound states for the PS molecule with experimental and theoretical results. The detailed information on the properties of the emission 22Π1/2-X12Π1/2, 22Π3/2-X22Π3/2, 12Σ−1/2-X12Π3/2 and 12Σ−1/2-X12Π1/2 bands of PS system, including the transition dipole moments (TDMs), permanent dipole moments (PDMs), Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) and radiative lifetimes, has been identified. We first calculated the f value and radiative lifetime of this radical. Whether the C state is 12Σ− or 12Δ is discussed. According to the calculation results, it is confirmed that the experimental C state is redistributed to 12Δ. Our study should be valuable for further experimental works understanding the spectroscopy and dynamics of the electronic excited states for PS.}

abstract = {Dipole moments, which contribute to the intensities of rotational
transitions and also affect reactivity, have been computed for nearly 80 compounds

We compare results from the commonly used B3LYP level of density functional theory
with ab initio results at the coupled cluster CCSD(T)/RCCSD(T) levels of theory.
Correlation consistent basis sets as large as quintuple zeta quality were used,
and extrapolations to the estimated complete basis set (CBSE) limit were performed
for almost all of the species with coupled cluster theory. In addition to evaluating
the accuracy of the results against available data, we explore various issues:
the critical importance of including diffuse basis functions, the range of basis
set dependence exhibited by the suite of molecules, and the presence of low-lying
excited states for some species. Dipole polarizabilities are also reported at the
CCSD(T)/RCCSD(T) CBSE level.},

abstract = {The potential energy curve (PEC) of ground X-2 Pi state of PS radical
is studied using highly accurate internally contracted multireference configuration
interaction approach with the Davidson modification. The Dunning's correlation-consistent
basis sets are used for the present study.To improve the quality of PECs, scalar
relativistic and core-valence correlation corrections are considered. Scalar relativistic
correction calculations are performed using the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian
approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. Core-valence correlation corrections
are calculated with an aug-cc- pCV5Z basis set. All the PECs are extrapolated to the
complete basis set limit. Using the PEC, the spectroscopic parameters (R-e, omega(e),
omega(e)x(e), omega(e)y(e), B-e, alpha(e), and D-e) of the X-2 Pi state of PS are
determined and compared with those reported in the literature. With the Breit-Pauli
operator, the PECs of two Omega states of the ground Lambda-S state are calculated.
Based on these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, R-e, omega(e), omega(e)x(e),
omega(e)y(e), B-e, and alpha(e)) of two Q states of PS are obtained. Compared with
those reported in the literature, the present results are accurate. The vibration
manifolds are evaluated for each Omega and Lambda-S state of non-rotation PS radical
by numerically solving the radical Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion. For each
vibrational state, the vibrational level and inertial rotation constants are obtained,
which are in excellent accordance with the experimental findings.},

set of spectroscopic parameters (equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational
frequencies, rotational constants, spin-orbit, and spin-spin constants), adiabatic
ionization energies, and electron affinities. For the low laying electronic states,
our calculations are consistent with previous works whereas the high excited states
present rather different shapes. Based on these new computations, the earlier ultraviolet
bands of PS and PS+ were reassigned. For PS- and in addition to the already known
anionic three bound electronic states (i.e., X-3 Sigma(-), (1)Delta, and 1(1)Sigma(+)),
our calculations show that the (1)Sigma(-), (3)Sigma(+), and the (3)Delta states
are energetically below their quartet parent neutral state (a(4)Pi). The depletion
of the J = 3 component of PS-((3)Delta) will mainly occur via weak interactions

high energy barrier, 52.6kcalmol−1. The PH3+S1 reaction path is the likely source
of the HPS1 molecule. The other possibilities are the PH1+H2S, PH22+SH1, and PH3+H2S
reactions, but they are spin forbidden and energetically unfavorable for the HPS1

by the PH1+SH1 reaction. The PH22+S1, PH3+SH1, P2+H2S, and P4+H2S reactions are
also favorable in terms of energetics; however, these reactions are spin forbidden.

pages = {1636S-1640S},
abstract = {Methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine are the 4 common
sulfur-containing amino acids, but only the first 2 are incorporated into proteins.
Sulfur belongs to the same group in the periodic table as oxygen but is much less
electronegative. This difference accounts for some of the distinctive properties
of the sulfur-containing amino acids. Methionine is the initiating amino acid in
the synthesis of virtually all eukaryotic proteins; N-formylmethionine serves the
same function in prokaryotes. Within proteins, many of the methionine residues
are buried in the hydrophobic core, but some, which are exposed, are susceptible
to oxidative damage. Cysteine, by virtue of its ability to form disulfide bonds,
plays a crucial role in protein structure and in protein-folding pathways. Methionine
metabolism begins with its activation to S-adenosylmethionine. This is a cofactor
of extraordinary versatility, playing roles in methyl group transfer, 5′-deoxyadenosyl
group transfer, polyamine synthesis, ethylene synthesis in plants, and many others.
In animals, the great bulk of S-adenosylmethionine is used in methylation reactions.
S-Adenosylhomocysteine, which is a product of these methyltransferases, gives rise
to homocysteine. Homocysteine may be remethylated to methionine or converted to
cysteine by the transsulfuration pathway. Methionine may also be metabolized by
a transamination pathway. This pathway, which is significant only at high methionine
concentrations, produces a number of toxic endproducts. Cysteine may be converted
to such important products as glutathione and taurine. Taurine is present in many
tissues at higher concentrations than any of the other amino acids. It is an essential
nutrient for cats.},

primitive Earth, we conclude that comets may have provided a primary source for
