   abstract = {Highly correlated ab initio methods were used in order to generate the potential energy curves and spin-orbit couplings of electronic ground and excited states of PS and PS+. We also computed those of the bound parts of the electronic states of the PS- anion. We used standard coupled cluster CCSD(T) level with augmented correlation-consistent basis sets, internally contacted multi-reference configuration interaction, and the newly developed CCSD(T)-F12 methods in connection with the explicitly correlated basis sets. Core-valence correction and scalar relativistic effects were examined. Our data consist of a set of spectroscopic parameters (equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies, rotational constants, spin-orbit, and spin-spin constants), adiabatic ionization energies, and electron affinities. For the low laying electronic states, our calculations are consistent with previous works whereas the high excited states present rather different shapes. Based on these new computations, the earlier ultraviolet bands of PS and PS+ were reassigned. For PS- and in addition to the already known anionic three bound electronic states (i.e., X-3 Sigma(-), (1)Delta, and 1(1)Sigma(+)), our calculations show that the (1)Sigma(-), (3)Sigma(+), and the (3)Delta states are energetically below their quartet parent neutral state (a(4)Pi). The depletion of the J = 3 component of PS-((3)Delta) will mainly occur via weak interactions with the electron continuum wave. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The diatomics containing group 14 and group 16 atoms exhibit rather small electron affinities, such as 0.036 eV and 0.14 eV for SiO and GeO, respectively. CS-, CSe-, SiO-, and GeO- are found to support dipole-bound anion states with electron affinities on the order of 0.01 eV. The electron affinity of NO is very small, whereas those of the heavier homologues are from close to 1 up to 1.6 eV.

The PS radical has been produced by discharging PSCl3 buffered with Ar. For all transitions the Lambda-doubling was resolved for both the (II1/2)-I-2 and (II3/2)-I-2 states. For some transitions with Delta F = 0 the hyperfine structure (hfs) caused by the P-atom could partially be resolved even for rather high J values. Analysis of the complete rotational data set of PS allows the derivation of a full set of molecular parameters, including the rotational constants B, D, H, the fine-structure constants A, gamma, D gamma, the parameters for the Lambda-doubling p, D-p, q, and the magnetic hyperfine constants a, b, c, d, C-I. All parameters have been determined, whereby a, c, and the nuclear spin rotation-constant Cr were obtained for the first time.},

   abstract = {The potential energy curve (PEC) of ground X-2 Pi state of PS radical is studied using highly accurate internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach with the Davidson modification. The Dunning's correlation-consistent basis sets are used for the present study.To improve the quality of PECs, scalar relativistic and core-valence correlation corrections are considered. Scalar relativistic correction calculations are performed using the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. Core-valence correlation corrections are calculated with an aug-cc- pCV5Z basis set. All the PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Using the PEC, the spectroscopic parameters (R-e, omega(e), omega(e)x(e), omega(e)y(e), B-e, alpha(e), and D-e) of the X-2 Pi state of PS are determined and compared with those reported in the literature. With the Breit-Pauli operator, the PECs of two Omega states of the ground Lambda-S state are calculated. Based on these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, R-e, omega(e), omega(e)x(e), omega(e)y(e), B-e, and alpha(e)) of two Q states of PS are obtained. Compared with those reported in the literature, the present results are accurate. The vibration manifolds are evaluated for each Omega and Lambda-S state of non-rotation PS radical by numerically solving the radical Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion. For each vibrational state, the vibrational level and inertial rotation constants are obtained, which are in excellent accordance with the experimental findings.},

   abstract = {The properties of the diatomic thiophosphorus radical PS and its cation and anion, in their ground electronic states, are studied using UHF, RHF, ROHF, GVB and MP2 ab initio methods with the STO-3G*, 3-21G*, 6-31G and 6-31G* basis sets. As expected, the STO-3G* basis set is insufficient for the anion (outer molecular orbitals unbound). Most of the results obtained with the 6-31G basis set are unsatisfactory. In contrast, the equilibrium internuclear distances (r(e)) obtained for the PS radical in all the ROHF and GVB optimizations with the 3-21G* and 6-31G* basis sets are satisfactory, the values ranging from 0.5 to 1.8% less than the best experimental value. The results indicate that r(e)(PS(1+)X-1 Sigma(+)) and r(e)(PS(1-) X-3 Sigma(-)) should be very close to 1.84 Angstrom and 2.03 Angstrom, respectively. The reliability of the MP2 results varies: omega(e) for the radical and the cation are 42% higher and 6% lower than the experimental frequencies, respectively. Thus MP2 computations on these species are not warranted. The dissociation energy for PS X-2 Pi(r), obtained by both the GVB(3)/6-31G*(5d) and (6d) computations is D-e = 5.0 eV, about 10% higher than the mass spectral value, D-e = 4.6 +/- 0.1 eV. For the negative ion the computed electron affinity and dissociation energies predict that it is stable and should be observable under suitable conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We compare results from the commonly used B3LYP level of density functional theory with ab initio results at the coupled cluster CCSD(T)/RCCSD(T) levels of theory. Correlation consistent basis sets as large as quintuple zeta quality were used, and extrapolations to the estimated complete basis set (CBSE) limit were performed for almost all of the species with coupled cluster theory. In addition to evaluating the accuracy of the results against available data, we explore various issues: the critical importance of including diffuse basis functions, the range of basis set dependence exhibited by the suite of molecules, and the presence of low-lying excited states for some species. Dipole polarizabilities are also reported at the CCSD(T)/RCCSD(T) CBSE level.},

First we briefly review the presence of this element in different cosmic sites, such as massive stellar cores, circumstellar and interstellar clouds, meteorites, lunar and Martian samples, interplanetary dust particles, cometary dust and planetary atmospheres. Thus we illustrate the fact that phosphorus seems to be, at the same time, scarce and ubiquitous in the solar system. Afterwards, by comparing the phosphorus content of our planet's main reservoirs with the amount of cometary and meteoritic matter captured by the primitive Earth, we conclude that comets may have provided a primary source for phosphorus compounds of prebiotic interest. Finally, we make a number of proposals aimed to gain observational supporting evidence to the above conclusion and other suggestions made in the article.},
