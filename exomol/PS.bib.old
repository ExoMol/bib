   abstract = {Highly correlated ab initio methods were used in order to generate the potential energy curves and spin-orbit couplings of electronic ground and excited states of PS and PS+. We also computed those of the bound parts of the electronic states of the PS- anion. We used standard coupled cluster CCSD(T) level with augmented correlation-consistent basis sets, internally contacted multi-reference configuration interaction, and the newly developed CCSD(T)-F12 methods in connection with the explicitly correlated basis sets. Core-valence correction and scalar relativistic effects were examined. Our data consist of a set of spectroscopic parameters (equilibrium geometries, harmonic vibrational frequencies, rotational constants, spin-orbit, and spin-spin constants), adiabatic ionization energies, and electron affinities. For the low laying electronic states, our calculations are consistent with previous works whereas the high excited states present rather different shapes. Based on these new computations, the earlier ultraviolet bands of PS and PS+ were reassigned. For PS- and in addition to the already known anionic three bound electronic states (i.e., X-3 Sigma(-), (1)Delta, and 1(1)Sigma(+)), our calculations show that the (1)Sigma(-), (3)Sigma(+), and the (3)Delta states are energetically below their quartet parent neutral state (a(4)Pi). The depletion of the J = 3 component of PS-((3)Delta) will mainly occur via weak interactions with the electron continuum wave. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   abstract = {Context. Phosphorus-bearing compounds have only been studied in the circumstellar environments of the asymptotic giant branch star IRC + 10 216 and the protoplanetary nebula CRL 2688, both carbon-rich objects, and the oxygen-rich red supergiant VY CMa. The current chemical models cannot reproduce the high abundances of PO and PN derived from observations of VY CMa. No observations have been reported of phosphorus in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. Aims. We aim to set observational constraints on the phosphorous chemistry in the circumstellar envelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, by focussing on the Mira-type variable star IK Tau. Methods. 
Using the IRAM 30m telescope and the Submillimeter Array, we observed four rotational transitions of PN (J = 2-1, 3-2, 6-5, 7-6) and four of PO (J = 5/2-3/2, 7/2-5/2, 13/2-11/2, 15/2-13/2). The IRAM 30m observations were dedicated line observations, while the Submillimeter Array data come from an unbiased spectral survey in the frequency range 279-355 GHz. Results. We present the first detections of PN and PO in an oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch star and estimate abundances X(PN/H-2) approximate to 3 x 10(-7) and X(PO/H-2) in the range 0.5-6.0 x 10(-7). This is several orders of magnitude higher than what is found for the carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch star IRC + 10 216. The diameter (less than or similar to 0.'' 7) of the PN and PO emission distributions measured in the interferometric data corresponds to a maximum radial extent of about 40 stellar radii. The abundances and the spatial occurrence of the molecules are in very good agreement with the results reported for VY CMa. We did not detect PS or PH3 in the survey. Conclusions. We suggest that PN and PO are the main carriers of phosphorus in the gas phase, with abundances possibly up to several 10(-7). The current chemical models cannot account for this, underlining the strong need for updated chemical models that include phosphorous compounds.},

CN and the homologue species have rather high electron affinities and especially the heavier congeners like SiAs-, GeP-, and GeAs- possess eight bound negative ion states, which belong to three different valence electron configurations. The diatomics containing group 14 and group 16 atoms exhibit rather small electron affinities, such as 0.036 eV and 0.14 eV for SiO and GeO, respectively. CS-, CSe-, SiO-, and GeO- are found to support dipole-bound anion states with electron affinities on the order of 0.01 eV. The electron affinity of NO is very small, whereas those of the heavier homologues are from close to 1 up to 1.6 eV. NS- and PO- possess at least an excited (1)Delta state, whereas NSe-, PS-, PSe-, AsO-, AsS-, and AsSe- own two excited anion states, (1)Delta and (1)Sigma(+).},

The PS radical has been produced by discharging PSCl3 buffered with Ar. For all transitions the Lambda-doubling was resolved for both the (II1/2)-I-2 and (II3/2)-I-2 states. For some transitions with Delta F = 0 the hyperfine structure (hfs) caused by the P-atom could partially be resolved even for rather high J values. Analysis of the complete rotational data set of PS allows the derivation of a full set of molecular parameters, including the rotational constants B, D, H, the fine-structure constants A, gamma, D gamma, the parameters for the Lambda-doubling p, D-p, q, and the magnetic hyperfine constants a, b, c, d, C-I. All parameters have been determined, whereby a, c, and the nuclear spin rotation-constant Cr were obtained for the first time.},

   abstract = {The potential energy curve (PEC) of ground X-2 Pi state of PS radical is studied using highly accurate internally contracted multireference configuration interaction approach with the Davidson modification. The Dunning's correlation-consistent basis sets are used for the present study.To improve the quality of PECs, scalar relativistic and core-valence correlation corrections are considered. Scalar relativistic correction calculations are performed using the third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. Core-valence correlation corrections are calculated with an aug-cc- pCV5Z basis set. All the PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Using the PEC, the spectroscopic parameters (R-e, omega(e), omega(e)x(e), omega(e)y(e), B-e, alpha(e), and D-e) of the X-2 Pi state of PS are determined and compared with those reported in the literature. With the Breit-Pauli operator, the PECs of two Omega states of the ground Lambda-S state are calculated. Based on these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, R-e, omega(e), omega(e)x(e), omega(e)y(e), B-e, and alpha(e)) of two Q states of PS are obtained. Compared with those reported in the literature, the present results are accurate. The vibration manifolds are evaluated for each Omega and Lambda-S state of non-rotation PS radical by numerically solving the radical Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion. For each vibrational state, the vibrational level and inertial rotation constants are obtained, which are in excellent accordance with the experimental findings.},

As expected, the STO-3G* basis set is insufficient for the anion (outer molecular orbitals unbound). Most of the results obtained with the 6-31G basis set are unsatisfactory. In contrast, the equilibrium internuclear distances (r(e)) obtained for the PS radical in all the ROHF and GVB optimizations with the 3-21G* and 6-31G* basis sets are satisfactory, the values ranging from 0.5 to 1.8% less than the best experimental value. The results indicate that r(e)(PS(1+)X-1 Sigma(+)) and r(e)(PS(1-) X-3 Sigma(-)) should be very close to 1.84 Angstrom and 2.03 Angstrom, respectively. The reliability of the MP2 results varies: omega(e) for the radical and the cation are 42% higher and 6% lower than the experimental frequencies, respectively. Thus MP2 computations on these species are not warranted. The dissociation energy for PS X-2 Pi(r), obtained by both the GVB(3)/6-31G*(5d) and (6d) computations is D-e = 5.0 eV, about 10% higher than the mass spectral value, D-e = 4.6 +/- 0.1 eV. For the negative ion the computed electron affinity and dissociation energies predict that it is stable and should be observable under suitable conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We compare results from the commonly used B3LYP level of density functional theory with ab initio results at the coupled cluster CCSD(T)/RCCSD(T) levels of theory. Correlation consistent basis sets as large as quintuple zeta quality were used, and extrapolations to the estimated complete basis set (CBSE) limit were performed for almost all of the species with coupled cluster theory. In addition to evaluating the accuracy of the results against available data, we explore various issues: the critical importance of including diffuse basis functions, the range of basis set dependence exhibited by the suite of molecules, and the presence of low-lying excited states for some species. Dipole polarizabilities are also reported at the CCSD(T)/RCCSD(T) CBSE level.},

   abstract = {A new interstellar molecule, PO (X-2 IIr), has been detected toward the envelope of the oxygen-rich supergiant star VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) using the Submillimeter 
Telescope of the Arizona Radio Observatory. The J = 5.5 -> 4.5 and J = 6.5 -> 5.5 rotational transitions of PO at 240 and 284 GHz were observed, each of which consisted of well-defined lambda- doublets. The line profiles are roughly parabolic in shape, analogous to PN, and suggest that this species arises from the spherical wind in VY CMa, as opposed to the collimated blue- and redshifted outflows. Comparison of line intensities indicates that PO arises from a confined source roughly 1'' in extent, with a column density of N-tot similar or equal to 2.8 x 10(15) cm(-2), which corresponds to a fractional abundance of f similar to 9 x 10(-8), relative to H-2. Consequently, PO and PN have similar concentrations in VY CMa, a result not predicted by either LTE or kinetic models of circumstellar chemistry. These phosphorus compounds may arise from shock-induced reactions in this active envelope. Phosphorus monoxide is the first interstellar molecule detected that contains a P-O bond, a moiety essential in biochemical compounds. It is also the first new species to be identified in an oxygen-rich, as opposed to a carbon-rich, circumstellar envelope.},

abstract= {In this work we consider the role of phosphorus in chemical evolution from an interdisciplinary approach. First we briefly review the presence of this element in different cosmic sites, such as massive stellar cores, circumstellar and interstellar clouds, meteorites, lunar and Martian samples, interplanetary dust particles, cometary dust and planetary atmospheres. Thus we illustrate the fact that phosphorus seems to be, at the same time, scarce and ubiquitous in the solar system. Afterwards, by comparing the phosphorus content of our planet's main reservoirs with the amount of cometary and meteoritic matter captured by the primitive Earth, we conclude that comets may have provided a primary source for phosphorus compounds of prebiotic interest. Finally, we make a number of proposals aimed to gain observational supporting evidence to the above conclusion and other suggestions made in the article.},

In the band systems of PS, several new bands have been found which form an extension of the ultraviolet system while, in the case of the visible bands, the earlier assignment of v?-values has to be increased by one unit. }
