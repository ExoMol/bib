   are reviewed, known collectively under the name Renner-Teller effect.
   The focus is on the years between 1960 and 1980, when numerous examples
   of the Renner-Teller effect became known experimentally. In the same
   years, Renner's original theory was refined and extended in various
   groups in order to account for the new observations. The method
   developed in A. J. Merer's research group in Vancouver is discussed in
   some detail. This effort, based on the theory of Hougen, Bunker, and
   Johns for large amplitude nuclear bending motion (1970), led to the
   first quantitative interpretation of the quasilinear bending level
   structure of the NH2 radical - itself the first known example of the
   Renner-Teller effect observed by Dressler and Ramsay in 1958.
   Alternative approaches, refinements, and extensions of the theory
   implemented after 1980 are also described, the most important extension
   being the inclusion of the stretching vibrational degrees of freedom,
   which allows the description of anharmonic Fermi interactions. Finally,
   the manifestations of the Renner-Teller effect expected in Rydberg
   states are discussed, and a sketch of the corresponding theory is
   presented. It is shown that the Renner-Teller effect can also play an
   important role in continuum processes, such as the recombination of
   electrons with linear ions. }},
