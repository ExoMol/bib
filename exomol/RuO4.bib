abstract = {Ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) is a heavy tetrahedral molecule characterized by an unusual volatility near ambient temperature. Because of its chemical toxicity and the radiological impact of its 103Ru and 106Ru isotopologues, the possible remote sensing of this compound in the atmosphere has renewed interest in its spectroscopic properties. The present contribution is the first investigation dealing with high-resolution line-by-line intensity measurements for the strong fundamental band observed near 
10 um, associated with the excitation of the infrared active stretching mode nu3. It relies on new, high resolution FTIR spectra recorded at room temperature, using a specially constructed cell and an isotopically pure sample of 102Ru16O4. Relying on an effective Hamiltonian and associated effective dipole moment [S Reymond–Laruinaz et al, J Mol Spectrosc 2015;315:46–54], the measured line intensities were assigned and dipole moment parameters determined. A HITRAN-formatted frequency and intensity line list was generated.}
