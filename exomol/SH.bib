title = {{An optical transmission spectrum for the ultra-hot Jupiter {WASP}-121b
measured with the Hubble Space Telescope}},

pages = {283},
abstract = {We present an atmospheric transmission spectrum for the ultra-hot
Jupiter WASP-121b, measured using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board
the Hubble Space Telescope. Across the 0.47–1 $\mu {\rm{m}}$ wavelength range,
the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to—and in some spectroscopic
channels exceeding—that previously measured at near-infrared wavelengths (1.15–1.65 $\mu {\rm{m}}$).
Wavelength-dependent variations in the opacity rule out a gray cloud deck at a
confidence level of 3.7σ and may instead be explained by VO spectral bands. We
find a cloud-free model assuming chemical equilibrium for a temperature of 1500 K
and a metal enrichment of 10–30× solar matches these data well. Using a free-chemistry
retrieval analysis, we estimate a VO abundance of $-{6.6}_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ dex. We
find no evidence for TiO and place a 3σ upper limit of −7.9 dex on its abundance,
suggesting TiO may have condensed from the gas phase at the day–night limb. The
opacity rises steeply at the shortest wavelengths, increasing by approximately five
pressure scale heights from 0.47 to 0.3 $\mu {\rm{m}}$ in wavelength. If this
feature is caused by Rayleigh scattering due to uniformly distributed aerosols,
it would imply an unphysically high temperature of 6810 ± 1530 K. One alternative
explanation for the short-wavelength rise is absorption due to SH (mercapto radical),
which has been predicted as an important product of non-equilibrium chemistry in
hot Jupiter atmospheres. Irrespective of the identity of the NUV absorber, it likely
captures a significant amount of incident stellar radiation at low pressures, thus
playing a significant role in the overall energy budget, thermal structure, and
circulation of the atmosphere.},

journal = AA,

pages = {A124},
abstract = {Through a survey of (sub-)millimetre emission lines of various sulphur-bearing
molecules, we aim to determine which molecules are the primary carriers of sulphur
in different types of AGB stars. In this paper, the first in a series, we investigate
the occurrence of H$_2$S in AGB circumstellar envelopes and determine its abundance,
where possible. We have surveyed 20 AGB stars with a range of mass-loss rates and
of different chemical types using the APEX telescope to search for rotational transition
lines of five key sulphur-bearing molecules: CS, SiS, SO, SO$_2$ and H$_2$S. Here
we present our results for H$_2$S, including detections, non-detections and detailed
radiative transfer modelling of the detected lines. We compare results based on
different descriptions of the molecular excitation of H$_2$S and different abundance
distributions, including those derived from chemical modelling results. We detected
H$_2$S towards five AGB stars, all of which have high mass-loss rates
of $\dot{M}\geq 5\times 10^{-6}M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and are oxygen-rich. H$_2$S
was not detected towards the carbon or S-type stars that fall in a similar mass-loss
range. For the stars in our sample with detections, we find peak o-H$_2$S abundances
relative to H$_2$ between $4\times 10^{-7}$ and $2.5\times 10^{-5}$. Overall, we
conclude that H$_2$S can play a significant role in oxygen-rich AGB stars with
higher mass-loss rates, but is unlikely to play a key role in stars of other chemical
types or the lower mass-loss rate oxygen-rich stars. For two sources, V1300 Aql
and GX Mon, H$_2$S is most likely the dominant sulphur-bearing molecule in the
circumstellar envelope.},

Pages = {435-447},
Abstract = {Sulphur-bearing species are often used to probe the physical structure
   of star-forming regions of the interstellar medium, but the chemistry of
   sulphur in these regions is still poorly understood. In dark clouds,
   sulphur is supposed to be depleted under a form that is still unknown
   despite numerous observations and chemical modelling studies that have
   been performed. In order to improve the modelling of sulphur chemistry,
   we propose an enhancement of the sulphur chemical network using
   experimental and theoretical literature. We test the effect of the
   updated network on the outputs of a three-phases gas-grain chemical
   model for dark cloud conditions using different elemental sulphur
   abundances. More particularly, we focus our study on the main sulphur
   reservoirs as well as on the agreement between model predictions and the
   abundances observed in the dark cloud TMC-1 (CP). Our results show that
   depending on the age of the observed cloud, the reservoir of sulphur
   could either be atomic sulphur in the gas phase or HS and H2S in icy
   grain bulks. We also report the first chemical model able to reproduce

controlling the timing sequence of the Stark decelerator, it is possible to create
a decelerated molecular packet containing only a single rotational state of either

beam containing a single rotation–vibration state will be a useful tool for the

abstract = {Using computational calculations the potential energy surface (PES)

the formation of two very stable species, HNSN and HNNS. Out of these two, HNNS
which has the signature N–N linkage was found to be the most stable species in the
PES. In view of the highly exothermic nature of the reaction surface, it has been
proposed that these two species can possibly be detected in the interstellar space.
For the first time it has also been shown that the reaction between the NH and NS
can lead to the possible formation of N2via the isomer HNNS, and how the effect
of tunnelling can make this reaction very much feasible, even under the extremely
low temperature conditions prevailing in the interstellar medium. Based on the
already reported results, a similar kind of behaviour for the NH + NO reaction
surface has also been proposed. These dissociation reactions leading to the formation
of N2 can be considered as potential secondary contributing channels while accounting
for the total estimates of N2 in the interstellar medium, and thus HNNS as well
as HNNO can be considered as stable reservoir molecules for interstellar N2. Besides
the formation of N2, the formation of another astronomically important radical,
SH in the cold interstellar clouds, has also been proposed.},

tested the theoretical band oscillator strength that was used. Because sunspots
are cooler than the photosphere, they host a large number of molecular species.
However, owing to photospheric radiation scattered into the observed umbra, no
lines of SH were detected in the sunspot spectrum, where they are expected to show
equivalent widths larger than those in the photosphere. Detection of weak lines in
the photosphere coupled with a non-detection of the relatively strong same lines
in the sunspot spectrum might raise doubts about the detection itself. We investigated
the choice of photospheric and sunspot models and the microturbulence values that
indicate that the predicted sunspot lines are about half as intense as reported
before, and the lines remain detectable.},

both the probability and cross section increase firstly and then decrease as the
collision energy increases. The existence of the resonance structure in both the

calculation of the rate constant reveals that the reaction occurring on the potential

formation associated with the HSO molecule are very likely to belong to its structural
isomer, HOS. It is also confirmed by the calculated thermodynamic properties including
standard reaction entropies, enthalpies, and equilibrium constants that, in the

abstract = {The transition state region for neutral hydrogen transfer reactions
can be accessed by photodetachment of a stable negative ion with a geometry similar
to that of the neutral transition state. In this work the SH + H2S and SD + D2S
reactions are investigated by photodetachment–photoelectron spectroscopy of HS−·H2S
and DS−·D2S. The spectra exhibit vibrational structure which is attributed to the
antisymmetric stretching mode (H-atom motion) of the neutral transitions state
for H-atom transfer. The spectra are compared to one-dimensional simulations
performed using a wave packet propagation scheme. Electronic structure calculations
of the anionic, neutral and transition-state geometries and calculations of the
vertical detachment energy at different levels of theory are used to support the
analysis of the spectra. A vertical detachment energy VDE of 3.06 eV has been
determined.},

abstract = {Rotational energy transfer (RET) by Ar collisions within the v′ = 0
level of the SH A2Σ+ state is probed using a laser-induced dispersed fluorescence
technique, following photodissociation of H2S at 248 nm. The Ar pressure is adjusted
appropriately to allow for significant observation of the single-collision induced
RET process. The spin-resolved and spin-averaged rate constants are then evaluated
with the aid of a kinetic model under single-collision conditions. The theoretical
counterparts are calculated using a quantum scattering method, in which a newly
fitted potential energy function is based on ab initio potential energy surface
reported previously. The experimental and theoretical kinetic data are essentially
consistent in the trend of N and ΔN dependence. Several propensity rules are found
in the RET collisions. For instance, for ΔN = 1, 2, and 3, the rate constants
decrease with increasing N or ΔN. Given a fixed ΔN, the rate constants of the
same initial N in the downward transition appear to be larger than those in the
upward transitions. In ΔN = 0, the F2 -
 F1 transitions prevail over the F1 -
 F2
transitions (F1 = N + 1/2, F2 = N − 1/2), whereas in ΔN ≠ 0, the fine-structure-
conserving collisions are more favored than the fine-structure-changing collisions.
The principle of microscopic reversibility is also examined for both experimental
and theoretical kinetic data, showing that translational energies of the RET collisions
are close to thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The propensity rules may be
rationalized according to this principle.},

from H2S with peak abundances between 1 and 10 mbar. S2 absorbs UV between 240

is probably more important than S2, as it is generally more abundant than S2
under hot Jupiter conditions and it absorbs at somewhat redder wavelengths. We
use molecular theory to compute an HS absorption spectrum from sparse available

at the longer wavelengths being temperature sensitive. When the two absorbers are
combined, radiative heating (per kg of gas) peaks at 100 μbars, with a total
stratospheric heating of ~8 × 104 W m–2 for a jovian planet orbiting a solar-twin

is a well behaved quadratic function of metallicity, ranging from 1.6 × 10–8

Based on a set of 65 solar Fe i lines, with accurate transition probabilities as

model. We succeed to reconcile abundance results obtained from low and high excitation
Fe i lines as well as from Fe ii lines and derive a solar photospheric abundance
of iron, A_Fe = 7.50 +/- 0.05, which perfectly agrees with the meteoritic value.

(HFCCs) of polyatomic radicals the symmetry adapted cluster expansion–configuration
interaction (SAC–CI) theory is applied to calculate anisotropic HFCCs also. The
results are compared with available experimental data from diatomic to polyatomic
radicals such as the vinoxy. For radicals consisting of only the first row atoms
Dunning’s double zeta (DZ) basis set is shown to be adequate, but for those containing
the second row atoms inclusion of polarization functions is required. Compared with
the isotropic HFCC the calculation of the anisotropic HFCC is less formidable.
However, ignorance of electron correlation causes serious disagreements with
experimental data.},

translational spectroscopy has been applied to a study of H2S photodissociation

H+H+S(1D) atoms are observed to dominate the product yield; the yield of H atoms
formed in conjunction with ground state SH(X) fragments is undetectably small.
The majority of the SH(A) fragments are formed in their v=0 level with a rotational
state population distribution that spans all possible bound and quasibound rotational
levels. The experimental determination of the energies of these hitherto unobserved
high rotational states has enabled a refinement of the SH(A) potential energy
function, an improved estimate of the SH(A) well depth (9280±600 cm−1), and thus
of the SH(X) ground state bond dissociation energy D00 (S–H)=3.71±0.07 eV. All aspects
of the observed energy disposal in the title photodissociation process may be understood,
qualitatively, if it is assumed that (i) the primary fragmentations occur on the
B̃ 1A1 potential energy surface and (ii) Flouquet’s ab initio calculations of portions
of this surface [Chem. Phys. 13, 257 (1976)] correctly predict its gross topological features.},

is suggested based on van Vlecks formalism. It is independent of Hund's coupling
cases and yields directly the energy levels and wavefunctions in terms of perturber
states. The procedure is applied to the X 2Π states of OH and SH whereby the
perturbation matrix was constructed in the basis of large-scale multi-reference
configuration interaction wavefunctions, which are computed for the X 2Π, A 2Σ+,
B 2Σ+, 12Σ-, 2Δ and 4Σ- and 4Π states as a function of internuclear separation.
In OH a splitting of 0·1591 cm-1 for the 2Π1/2(j = ½) state and 0·0521 cm-1 for
the 2Π3/2(j = 3/2) state is calculated compared to the corresponding measured
splittings of 0·1577 cm-1 and 0·0551 cm-1. For SH the corresponding splittings
are 0·3062 cm-1 compared to the experimental value of 0·2814 cm-1 for the 2Π1/2
component and 0·0041 cm-1 compared to the measured value of 0·0035 cm-1 for the 2Π3/2
component. It is found that for large internuclear separations in SH the 4Σ-
and 2Σ- states are the dominant perturbers, and that the 4Π state is not negligible,
while as expected the A 2Σ+ state is the dominant contributor near equilibrium.
This shows that the standard restriction to include only doublet states must be
abandoned if the Λ-splitting of high vibrational levels is of interest. The results
are quite encouraging and it is expected that the suggested procedure can be
applied with comparable success to the Λ-splitting in 2Π states of arbitrary diatomics.},

Sulphur compounds are more prevalent than had been realized. Assessments of cometary

abstract = {A model is presented for the gas phase chemistry of molecules containing
sulfur in dense interstellar clouds. The sulfur chemistry is different from that
used in previous models as a result of an extensive search of the recent literature
and the availability of new laboratory data. The changes have a significant effect
on the calculated abundance of sulfur compounds. The linked chemistry of sulfur
and oxygen in the present model requires a severe depletion of sulfur and low
fractional abundances of both O and O2 in the dense clouds. In contrast, the high
abundance of SO and the low abundance of CS relative to SO in the HVS in the KL may
indicate an oxygen-rich, high temperature environment compared to OMC-1. The
formation of S-H bonds is slow because of the absence of radiative association
between S(+) and H2. The present model underestimates the abundance of H2S unless
a radiative association reaction between HS(+) and H2 is postulated.},

nearly Boltzmann rotational distributions characterized by temperatures of 375±15

Although roughly 20 000 cm−1 of energy is available to the fragments, the average
internal energy of the SH fragments is only 320±20 cm−1. Thus, most of the available
energy must appear in the relative recoil coordinate between the H and SH fragments.

the surface of oxide grains, the ion reactions at the grain surface can be an
efficient source of sulfur bearing molecules to the gas. The ion reactions at
the grain surface can lead to all 10 observed sulfur molecules; existing gas
chemistry does not predict the presence of sulfur bearing molecules in diffuse
clouds, so that detection of these molecules in such regions will be a test of
the effect of grain surface chemistry or of a radiative association which are
usually neglected.},

before the OH. The oxidation at low temperatures is interpreted in terms of a
branching‐chain mechanism involving the reactions. At higher temperatures, participation
of the reaction O+H2S-
SO+H2 provides an additional route for the formation of
SO2 and hence leads to a reduced induction time for its appearance.},

transient reaction intermediates by means of their absorption spectra in the

combustion of carbon disulphide, hydrogen sulphide and carbonyl sulphide under
adiabatic and isothermal conditions. At the shortest delay time obtainable, a
new spectrum appears in all of the reactions studied, in the wavelength range 2400
to 1900 Å. This spectrum has been shown to be that of the SO radical and in the
case of the hydrogen sulphide reactions the spectrum can be seen to merge into a
dissociation continuum, the convergence limit lying at 53677 cm-1, corresponding
to a dissociation energy for SO of 127.1 kcal/mole. Irregularities in the vibrational
intervals of the 3Σ- upper state of SO show that some of the levels are strongly
perturbed, indicating a crossing or attempted crossing of this 3Σ- curve with
another potential curve. This is confirmed in the plot of ΔGv'+1/2 against v'
which has a point of inflexion between v' = 14 and v' = 17. It is shown that the
potential curve responsible for these vibrational perturbations is the 3II which
is also responsible for the predissociation previously observed by Martin in the
emission spectrum of SO, and that this state must dissociate to ground-state atomic
products, i.e. O(3P) and S(3P). A new transient spectrum has been observed in the
wavelength range 1840 to 1740 Å in the hydrogen sulphide and carbon disulphide
reactions and these same bands have also been detected in the flash photolysis
of SO2. It has been possible to fit the bands into a vibrational scheme and to
assign them to an isomeric form of SO2. Reaction mechanisms for the combustion
of H2S, CS2 and COS and a mechanism for the formation of SO2 are discussed.},

ionization potentials have been found: H2S, 10.47V; MeSH, 9.44V; H2Se, 9.88V; H2Te,
9.14V. In the case of one series for H2Se fifteen members of the series were observed.
The spectra of the deuterides are almost identical with those of the hydrides,
showing that virtually every band in the spectra is due to a separate electronic
transition. This and the general nature of the rotational fine structure show the
transitions concerned to be those of an electron from a non-bonding ground-state
orbital, i.e. from the p lone-pair ground-state orbital. The nature of the upper
orbitals of the various series is also interpreted and shown to provide explanations
of certain peculiarities of the observations. The quantity I(X) — J(H2X), where
X is a group VI element, or I( Y ) — I( HY), where Y is a group VII element, is
shown to be positive and comparatively large when X or Y lies in the first period
of the periodic table, but to change sign and to remain almost constant at a small
negative value as one passes to elements in later periods. A plot of I(H2X)against
the first ionization potential of the corresponding inert gas is linear. Extrapolation
enables the first ionization potential of H2Po to be predicted at 8.6V. A similar
plot for the halogen acids, if assumed linear, yields a predicted first ionization
potential for HF of 17.0±0.7V.},

The rotational structure indicates that the ground state is an inverted 2Π, and
the excited state a 2Σ. Because of the strong ΛΣ coupling in the 2Π state the
doublet is wide, and since the Boltzmann factor greatly favors 2Π32, only the
strongest branch, Q2, from the 2Π12 state is found. From 2Π32 the QP21 and RQ21
