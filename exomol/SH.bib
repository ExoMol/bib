	has been used to further investigate the collision-free photodissociation
	of H2S and D2S molecules both in the near ultraviolet (at 218.2 and
	221.6 nm) and in the vacuum ultraviolet (at 121.6 nm). Measurements
	of the H/D atom photofragment angular distributions confirms that
	the near UV dissociation occurs promptly, following a perpendicular
	photo-excitation. More than 99\% of the resulting SH/SD fragments
	are formed in their ground vibronic level, with a ca. 3 : 2 preference
	in favour of the lower (2PI3/2) spin-orbit component. Product rotation
	accounts for ca. 1 \% of the available energy in the case of H2S
	photolysis at these near UV wavelengths (ca. 2\% in the case of D2S
	dissociation). The ground-state SH/SD photofragments can also be
	photolysed at these near UV excitation wavelengths. Simulations of
	the kinetic energy distribution of the resulting H/D atomic fragments
	show that the secondary photolysis also involves a perpendicular
	transition, and that the partner S atoms are formed in all three
	3P(J) spin-orbit states. The product energy disposal following 121.6
	nm photolysis of D2S closely parallels that deduced in an earlier
	study of H2S photodissociation at this same wavelength (Schnieder
	et al., J. Chem. Phys., 1990, 92, 7027). The D-atom kinetic energy
	spectrum shows clear evidence for the formation of rovibrationally
	excited SD(A 2SIGMA+) fragments amongst the primary products, and
	also suggests an important role for the three-body dissociation process
	leading to D + D + S(1D) atoms. Given D(o)o(HS-H) = 31 480 +/- 40
	cm-1, the present results provide a refined value for the S-D bond
	strength in the D2S molecule; D(o)o(DS-D) = 32030 +/- 50 cm-1; for
	the SH and SD radical bond dissociation energies; D(o)o(S-H) = 29300

	states has been predicted for the first time when the rotational
	quantum number J is set to equal zero ( J = 0) by solving the radial
	Schrodinger equation of nuclear motion. The complete vibrational
	levels, classical turning points, inertial rotation and centrifugal
	distortion constants are reproduced from the SD ( X-2 Pi) potential
	when J = 0. The total and various partial-wave cross sections are
	calculated for the elastic collisions between the ground-state S
	and D atoms at energies from 1.0 X 10(-11) to 1.0 X 10(-4) a. u.
	when the two atoms approach each other along the SD( X-2 Pi) interaction
	potential. No shape resonances can be found in the total elastic
	cross sections. The results show that the shape of the total elastic
	cross sections is mainly dominated by the s-partial wave at very
	low temperatures. Because of the weakness of the shape resonances
	coming from various partial waves, they are all covered up by the
	strong total elastic cross sections.},

	Here we address optically active S-containing species and CO(2) at
	1200 <= T <= 2000 K. HS (mercapto) and S(2) are highly reactive species
	that are generated photochemically and thermochemically from H(2)S
	with peak abundances between 1 and 10 mbar. S(2) absorbs UV between
	240 and 340 nm and is optically thick for metallicities {[}S/H] >
	0 at T >= 1200 K. HS is probably more important than S2, as it is
	generally more abundant than S2 under hot Jupiter conditions and
	it absorbs at somewhat redder wavelengths. We use molecular theory
	to compute an HS absorption spectrum from sparse available data and
	find that HS should absorb strongly between 300 and 460 nm, with
	absorption at the longer wavelengths being temperature sensitive.
	When the two absorbers are combined, radiative heating ( per kg of
	gas) peaks at 100 mu bars, with a total stratospheric heating of
	similar to 8 x 10(4) W m(-2) for a jovian planet orbiting a solar-twin
	at 0.032 AU. Total heating is insensitive to metallicity. The CO(2)
	mixing ratio is a well behaved quadratic function of metallicity,
	ranging from 1.6 x 10(-8) to 1.6 x 10(-4) for -0.3 < {[}M/H] < 1.7.
	CO(2) is insensitive to insolation, vertical mixing, temperature
	(1200 < T < 2000), and gravity. The photochemical calculations confirm
	that CO(2) should prove a useful probe of planetary metallicity.},

   abundance reconciled}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{469}},
Pages = {435-447},
Abstract = {{Sulphur-bearing species are often used to probe the physical structure
   of star-forming regions of the interstellar medium, but the chemistry of
   sulphur in these regions is still poorly understood. In dark clouds,
   sulphur is supposed to be depleted under a form that is still unknown
   despite numerous observations and chemical modelling studies that have
   been performed. In order to improve the modelling of sulphur chemistry,
   we propose an enhancement of the sulphur chemical network using
   experimental and theoretical literature. We test the effect of the
   updated network on the outputs of a three-phases gas-grain chemical
   model for dark cloud conditions using different elemental sulphur
   abundances. More particularly, we focus our study on the main sulphur
   reservoirs as well as on the agreement between model predictions and the
   abundances observed in the dark cloud TMC-1 (CP). Our results show that
   depending on the age of the observed cloud, the reservoir of sulphur
   could either be atomic sulphur in the gas phase or HS and H2S in icy
   grain bulks. We also report the first chemical model able to reproduce
   the abundances of observed S-bearing species in TMC-1 (CP) using as
   elemental abundance of sulphur its cosmic value.}},
