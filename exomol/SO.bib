Title = {{RARE ISOTOPIC SPECIES OF SULFUR MONOXIDE: THE ROTATIONAL SPECTRUM IN THE
   THz REGION}},
Journal =ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{813}},
Abstract = {{Many sulfur-bearing species have been detected in different astronomical
   environments and have allowed us to derive important information about
   the chemical and physical composition of interstellar regions. In
   particular, these species have also been shown to trace and probe
   hot-core environment time evolution. Among the most prominent
   sulfur-bearing molecules is SO, the sulfur monoxide radical, one of the
   more ubiquitous and abundant, which is also observed in its isotopic
   substituted species such as (SO)-S-34 and (SO)-O-18. Due to the
   importance of this simple diatomic system, and in order to face the
   challenge of modern radioastronomical facilities, an extension to the
   THz range of the rare isotopologues of sulfur monoxide has been
   performed. High-resolution rotational molecular spectroscopy has been
   employed to extend the available data set of four isotopic species, SO,
   34SO, (SO)-O-17, and (SO)-O-18, up to the 1.5 THz region. The frequency
   coverage and spectral resolution of our measurements allowed a better
   constraint of the molecular constants of the four species considered,
   specifically focusing on the two oxygen-substituted isotopologues. Our
   measurements were also employed in an isotopically invariant fit
   including all of the available pure rotational and ro-vibrational
   transitions for all of the SO isotopologues, thus enabling accurate
   predictions of the rotational transitions at higher frequencies. We also
   provide comparisons with recent works performed on the same system,
   demonstrating the quality of our experiment and the improvement of the
   data sets for all of the species considered. Transition frequencies for
   this system can now be used with confidence by the astronomical
   community well into the THz spectral region.}},

	has yielded multiple discoveries. Abundance of each molecule varies
	strongly on many timescales over the entire sub-Earth Venus hemisphere.
	Diurnal behavior is evident, with more SO2, and less SO, at night

	The sum of SO2 and SO abundances varies by an order of magnitude

	spectra and interferometric spectral maps show evidence for a day/night
	asymmetry in the outgassing. From the analysis of the spectral maps,
	including the astrometry, we show that SO and CS present in addition
	a jet-like structure that may be the gaseous counterpart of the dust
	high-latitude jet observed in optical images. A CS rotating jet is
	also observed. Using the astrometry provided by continuum radio maps
	obtained in parallel at IRAM, we conclude that there is no need to
	invoke the existence of nongravitational forces acting on this comet,
	and provide an updated orbit. The radial extension of H2S is found
	to be consistent with direct release of H2S from the nucleus. SO
	displays an extended radial distribution. Assuming that SO2 is the
	parent of SO, the photodissociation rate of SO is measured to be
	1.5 x 10(-4) s(-1) at 1 AU from the Sun. This is lower than most
	laboratory-based estimates and may suggest that SO is not solely
	produced by SO2 photolysis. From the observations of J(2-1) and J(5-4)
	CS lines, we deduce a CS photodissociation rate of 1-5 x 10(-5) s(-1).
	The photodissociation rate of CS2, the likely parent of CS, cannot
	be constrained due to insuffcient angular resolution, but our data
	are consistent with published values. Conclusions. These observations

	excitation rate coefficients of SO by He, useful for studies of high-temperature
	environments. Methods. A new accurate three dimensional (3D) potential
	energy surface was calculated for the SO-He system which explicitly
	takes into account the r-dependence of the SO vibration as well as
	the R-distance and theta angle which describe the relative position
	of the collision partners. The dynamics calculations were performed
	according to the VCC-IOS approximation. Results. The new rate coefficients
	between the ro-vibrational levels are calculated for temperatures

  abstract = {The globule CB 34, which harbours a cluster of class 0 young stellar
	object (YSO) protostars, has been investigated through a multiline
	SO and SiO survey at millimetre wavelengths. The SO data reveal that
	the globule consists of three quiescent high-density (similar to10(5)
	cm(-3)) clumps, labelled A, B and C, with sizes of similar to0.2-0.3
	pc. The SiO data provide evidence for high-velocity gas across the
	globule. Most likely, the high-velocity gas is distributed in three
	distinct high-velocity outflows associated with the YSOs in each
	of the three clumps. High-velocity SO features have been detected
	only towards the two brightest SiO outflows. These broad SO components
	exhibit spatial and spectral distributions which are consistent with
	those of the SiO emission, so they can also be used as tracers of
	the outflows. The comparison between the spatial and spectral properties
	of the SO and SiO emissions in the three clumps suggests different
	evolutionary stages for the embedded YSOs. In particular, the YSO
	associated with clump C exhibits some peculiarities, namely smaller
	SiO linewidths, lower SiO column densities, a lack of extended SiO
	structure and of SO wings, and the presence of a SO spatial distribution
	which is displaced with respect to the location of the YSO. This
	behaviour is well explained if the SiO and SO molecules which were
	produced at high velocities in the shocked region have been destroyed
	or slowed down because of the interaction with the ambient medium,
	and the chemistry is dominated again by low-temperature reactions.
	Thus our observations strongly suggest that the YSO in clump C is
	in a more evolved phase than the other members of the cluster.},

	that the lines are optically thin we derive column densities of about
	N(SO)= 5 10(12) cm(-2). Based on the visual extinction estimates
	we derive abundances X(SO)=2 10(-9), thus again higher than can be
	predicted by chemical models with standard assumptions on a low initial
	S abundance in the gas phase. Our new observations therefore confirm
	our previous conclusion, that in cirrus clouds sulphur must be essentially
	undepleted to explain the amount of SO detected. For MCLD 126.6+24.5
	we present an analysis of our extensive SO (N-J = 1(0) --> 0(1))
	mapping. The SO emission reveals clumpy structure of that cloud.
	We decompose the SO cloud into 17 individual clumps. Those clumps
	follow the same size-line width relation as high latitude molecular
	clouds (HLCs) on larger scales. Also, the size-density relation for
	the SO clouds has the same slope as that for other HLCs found from

	the CS (J = 2 --> 1) and (3 --> 2) lines. Only MCLD 126.6+24.5 and
	MBM 32 were detected in CS. For the most intense SO clump in MCLD

	ratio of CS and SO ranges from unity for MCLD 126.6+24.5 to less

	in that clouds. Our detailed comparison of CS and SO in MCLD 126.6+24.5
	both in position and in velocity indicate that the molecules do not
	necessarily coexist in the cloud; we find that both molecules are
	not equally distributed, that the profiles of both molecules look

	photodissociation of SO2 by a 193-nm ArF excimer laser produced SO(X(3)
	Sigma(-)) concentrations close to 10(16) cm(-3) over a 50-cm length.
	Pumping of SO(B-3 Sigma(-)) by the KrF laser occurred from the v''=2
	ground state cm vibrational level which was preferentially produced
	by photodissociation. The fraction of ground state population that
	could be excited to SO(B) was determined by measuring the saturation
	fluence for excitation as a function of buffer gas pressure and comparing
	with a simple model. Addition of a buffer gas increased excitation
	by nearly 30 times due to increased rotational mixing in the ground
	electronic state. Lasing was demonstrated on six new vibrational
	bands of fully-allowed SO(B-X) band in the region 262-315 nm. A small-signal
	gain coefficient of 0.11 cm(-1) and pulse energy of 11 mu J were
	achieved on the 270-nm SO-(B,v'=2-->X,v''=5) laser transition. A
	full computational rate equation model of the excitation and lasing
	dynamics, including collisional rotational mixing, was developed.
	The A(3) Pi electronic state of SO was also investigated as a possible
	ultraviolet energy storage laser medium. Excitation of SO(A(3) Pi,v'=5,6)
	near 250 nm was achieved after a time delay from photodissociation
	to allow for vibrational relaxation into SO(X,v''=0). Measurements
	of the radiative lifetime, deactivation rate, and saturation fluence,
	along with computation modeling, indicate that a storage laser based
	on the weak SO(A,v'=0-->X,v''=4) transition is not feasible with
	our production and excitation capabilities. Lasing on a direct-pumped
	single rotational transition of the SO(A,v'=5-->X,v''=1) band may
	be possible, but with very limited capacity to store energy.},

Title = {A COMPLETE SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF {SO} AND ITS ISOTOPOLOGUES UP
   TO THE TERAHERTZ DOMAIN},
Journal = AJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{799}},
Abstract = {{In order to obtain accurate terahertz center frequencies for SO and its
   isotopologues, we have studied the absorption spectrum of SO, (SO)-S-34,
   and (SO)-S-33 up to 2.5 THz using continuous-wave terahertz photomixing
   based on a frequency comb providing an accuracy down to 10 kHz. Sulfur
   monoxide was produced in a radio frequency discharge of air in a cell
   containing pure sulfur. Together with the strong absorption signal of
   the main isotopologue, transitions of (SO)-S-34 (S-34: 4.21\%) and 33SO
   (S-33: 0.75\%) were observed in natural abundance. The newly observed
   transitions constitute an extension of the observed rotational quantum
   numbers of the molecule toward higher N values, allowing an improvement
   of the molecular parameters for the three species. An isotopically
   invariant fit has been performed based on pure rotational and
   ro-vibrational transitions of all SO isotopologues, enabling their
   accurate line position prediction at higher frequencies. Thanks to this
   new set of parameters, it is now possible to predict with very high
   accuracy the frequencies of the ro-vibrational lines. This should enable
   the research of SO in the mid-IR using ground-based IR telescopes,
   space-based telescope archives (Infrared Space Observatory, Spitzer),
   and future space missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope. This
   set of parameters is particularly well adapted for the detection of SO
   lines in O-rich evolved stars or in molecular clouds in absorption
   against bright IR sources.}},
