Abstract = {JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where
   molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) trace photochemistry,
   metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions
   that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing
   species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of
   planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3 to 1000x solar and
   temperatures from 250 to 2050 K. These models map out the ``SO2
   shoreline,{''} the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2
   may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive
   indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly
   on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends
   surprisingly weakly on X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation, also weakly on
   Kzz (for Teq greater than or similar to 600 K), and is essentially
   independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing
   number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing
   molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH,
   and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2.
   Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing
   species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable
   in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional
   observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for
   future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully
   self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of
   planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction
   rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species.},

Title = {Ultraviolet and visible remote sensing of volcanic gas emissions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {468},
Abstract = {As magma rises in volcanic systems, volatile species exsolve from the
   silicate melt and are emitted as gases into the atmosphere. Measuring
   the magnitude and composition of gas emissions from volcanoes provides
   insights into processes occurring deep within the Earth and helps
   constrain the impact of volcanic degassing on atmospheric chemistry.
   Optical remote sensing techniques allow volcanic gas emissions to be
   characterized without the need to access hazardous areas near active
   volcanic vents. This paper reviews the state of the art in ultraviolet
   and visible volcanic gas remote sensing from the ground, air, and space.
   Special attention is given to discussing the physics of atmospheric
   radiative transfer on which these techniques are based. The
   functionality and limitations of different remote sensing instruments
   are examined, making clear that the ideal choice of instrumentation will
   depend on the volcanic system to which it is applied and the sought
   measurement parameters. Common algorithms for determining trace gas
   column densities, gas burdens, and volcanic emission rates from
   measurements of spectral radiance are outlined and compared, showing how
   some algorithms attempt to model the physics of the measurement while
   others maximize sensitivity. Several examples demonstrate how remote
   sensing measurements continue to advance our understanding of volcanic
   systems and their impact on the atmosphere. Finally, a few promising
   directions of inquiry are suggested that could lead to improvements in
   remote sensing instrumentation and analysis techniques. By combining
   spectroscopic and imaging techniques, improving our understanding of
   atmospheric radiative transfer, expanding the suite of target gases, and
   increasing the coverage and frequency of observations, we stand to
   significantly improve our ability to detect and quantify volcanic gas
   emissions and gain new insights into important Earth-system processes.},

Volume = {330},
Abstract = {Version 5.2 SO2 data from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier
   transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) in low Earth orbit are used to
   determine global altitude-latitude abundance distributions. This new
   data set has SO2 volume mixing ratios (VMRs) from 11.5 to 39.5 km in
   altitude from February 2004 to July 2023. The average background SO2
   abundance is plotted along with the abundance for four different
   seasons. These distributions show that there is a stratospheric source
   of SO2 that comes from the decline in sulfate aerosol abundance with
   increasing altitude. The visible and near-infrared photolysis of
   sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is the primary source of SO2 in the middle
   stratosphere. There is also a source of SO2 in the upper stratosphere
   and mesosphere. The Brewer-Dobson circulation enhances SO2 at higher
   altitudes, particularly by descent near the winter pole. The elevated
   abundance of SO2 near the poles originates from meteoric sources as well
   as UV photolysis of H2SO4 in the mesosphere. Large volcanic eruptions

Title = {{Sulfur dioxide in the mid-infrared transmission spectrum of WASP-39b}},
Journal = {Nature},

Pages = {979+},
Abstract = {The recent inference of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of the
   hot (approximately 1,100 K), Saturn-mass exoplanet WASP-39b from
   near-infrared JWST observations(1-3) suggests that photochemistry is a
   key process in high-temperature exoplanet atmospheres(4). This is
   because of the low (<1 ppb) abundance of SO2 under thermochemical
   equilibrium compared with that produced from the photochemistry of H2O
   and H2S (1-10 ppm)(4-9). However, the SO2 inference was made from a
   single, small molecular feature in the transmission spectrum of WASP-39b
   at 4.05 mu m and, therefore, the detection of other SO2 absorption bands
   at different wavelengths is needed to better constrain the SO2
   abundance. Here we report the detection of SO2 spectral features at 7.7
   and 8.5 mu m in the 5-12-mu m transmission spectrum of WASP-39b measured
   by the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Low Resolution Spectrometer
   (LRS)10. Our observations suggest an abundance of SO2 of 0.5-25 ppm (1
   sigma range), consistent with previous findings(4). As well as SO2, we
   find broad water-vapour absorption features, as well as an unexplained
   decrease in the transit depth at wavelengths longer than 10 mu m.
   Fitting the spectrum with a grid of atmospheric forward models, we
   derive an atmospheric heavy-element content (metallicity) for WASP-39b
   of approximately 7.1-8.0 times solar and demonstrate that photochemistry
   shapes the spectra of WASP-39b across a broad wavelength range.},

   the first JWST transmission spectrum of the hot Saturn-mass exoplanet,
   WASP-39 b, obtained with the NIRSpec instrument in the 3-5 mu m range to
   investigate (a) what atmospheric constraints are possible with
   JWST-quality data in this spectral range, (b) requirements for
   atmospheric models used in retrievals, (c) effect of differences between
   data reduction pipelines on retrieved atmospheric properties, and (d)
   complementarity between JWST data in the 3-5 mu m range and Hubble Space
   Telescope (HST) observations at shorter wavelengths. JWST spectra in the
   3-5 mu m range provide a promising avenue for chemical detections while
   encompassing a window in cloud opacity for several prominent aerosols.
   We confirm recent inferences of CO2, SO2, H2O, and CO in WASP-39 b;
   report tentative evidence for H2S; and retrieve elemental abundances
   consistent with Saturn's metallicity. We retrieve molecular abundances
   with similar to 0.3-0.6 dex precision with this relatively limited
   spectral range. When considering the 3-5 mu m data alone, reported
   differences in spectra with different reduction pipelines can affect
   abundance estimates by up to similar to 1 dex and the detectability of
   less prominent species. Complementing with data at shorter wavelengths,
   e.g., with other JWST instruments or HST WFC3 (similar to 0.8-1.7 mu m),
   can significantly improve the accuracy and precision of the abundance
   estimates. The high data quality enables constraints on aerosol
   properties, including their composition, modal size, and extent,
   motivating their consideration in retrievals. Our results highlight the
   promise of JWST exoplanet spectroscopy, while underscoring the
   importance of robust data reduction and atmospheric retrieval approaches
   in the JWST era.},

  abstract = {The newfound ability to detect SO2 in exoplanet atmospheres presents an
   opportunity to measure sulfur abundances and so directly test between
   competing modes of planet formation. In contrast to carbon and oxygen,
   whose dominant molecules are frequently observed, sulfur is much less
   volatile and resides almost exclusively in solid form in protoplanetary
   disks. This dichotomy leads different models of planet formation to
   predict different compositions of gas giant planets. Whereas
   planetesimal-based models predict roughly stellar C/S and O/S ratios,
   pebble-accretion models more often predict superstellar ratios. To
   explore the detectability of SO2 in transmission spectra and its ability
   to diagnose planet formation, we present a grid of atmospheric
   photochemical models and corresponding synthetic spectra for WASP-39b
   (where SO2 has been detected). Our 3D grid contains 11(3) models
   (spanning 1-100x the solar abundance ratio of C, O, and S) for thermal
   profiles corresponding to the morning and evening terminators, as well
   as mean terminator transmission spectra. Our models show that for a
   WASP-39b-like O/H and C/H enhancement of \& SIM;10x solar, SO2 can only
   be seen for C/S and O/S \& LSIM; 1.5x solar, and that WASP-39b's
   reported SO2 abundance of 1-10 ppm may be more consistent with
   planetesimal accretion than with pebble-accretion models (although some
   pebble models also manage to predict similarly low ratios). More extreme
   C/S and O/S ratios may be detectable in higher-metallicity atmospheres,
   suggesting that smaller and more metal-rich gas and ice giants may be
   particularly interesting targets for testing planet formation models.
   Future studies should explore the dependence of SO2 on a wider array of
   planetary and stellar parameters, both for the prototypical SO2 planet
   WASP-39b, as well as for other hot Jupiters and smaller gas giants.},

  abstract = {Photochemistry is a fundamental process of planetary atmospheres that regulates the atmospheric composition and stability1. However, no unambiguous photochemical products have been detected in exoplanet atmospheres so far. Recent observations from the JWST Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program2,3 found a spectral absorption feature at 4.05 μm arising from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere of WASP-39b. WASP-39b is a 1.27-Jupiter-radii, Saturn-mass (0.28 MJ) gas giant exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star with an equilibrium temperature of around 1,100 K (ref. 4). The most plausible way of generating SO2 in such an atmosphere is through photochemical processes5,6. Here we show that the SO2 distribution computed by a suite of photochemical models robustly explains the 4.05-μm spectral feature identified by JWST transmission observations7 with NIRSpec PRISM (2.7σ)8 and G395H (4.5σ)9. SO2 is produced by successive oxidation of sulfur radicals freed when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is destroyed. The sensitivity of the SO2 feature to the enrichment of the atmosphere by heavy elements (metallicity) suggests that it can be used as a tracer of atmospheric properties, with WASP-39b exhibiting an inferred metallicity of about 10× solar. We further point out that SO2 also shows observable features at ultraviolet and thermal infrared wavelengths not available from the existing observations.},

  abstract = {Lava lakes are a fascinating but somewhat rare form of volcanic
   activity. Lava lakes are large free surfaces of hot lava that discharge
   continuously, and almost quietly, heat and volcanic gases into the
   atmosphere. They are thought to be fed by convection processes that
   bring hot gas-rich magma to the surface and back downward, after its
   cooling and outgassing. A lava lake represents a latent threat for the
   populations living nearby, as it can drain suddenly through fissures and
   generate dangerously fast lava flows. We present time series of Volcanic
   Radiative Power (VRP) and SO2 flux measured from satellites (MODIS and
   OMI, respectively) from several lava lakes on Earth (Erta Ale,
   Nyiragongo, Kilauea, Nyamuragira, Ambrym, and Villarrica). Based on
   long-term trends plotted in a simple VRP versus SO2 flux diagram, we
   propose a new classification of lava lakes in three categories: small
   lakes, large foam-dominated lakes, and large melt-dominated lakes. Small
   lakes show a long-term correlation between VRP and SO2 emissions, while
   large lakes seem to show an anticorrelation between VRP and SO2
   emissions. This at-first-glance surprising anticorrelation probably
   results from the limited heat transport capacity of the gas-rich foam
   that initially feeds the convection of these lakes. We also show that
   the formation of three large lava lakes in the last 2 decades at the
   rift and hotspot volcanoes followed a similar trend of transitioning, in
   a few months, from foam-dominated to melt-dominated. We deduce that lava
   lake formation at these volcanoes follows a common sequence of processes
   that includes the formation of a large shallow magma reservoir and its
   outgassing through a newly formed pit crater.},

   exoplanets. Nevertheless, despite their properties and relevance as tracers 
   of the giant planets’ formation histories, little attention has been paid to 
   these species in the context of hot Jupiter atmospheres. 
   Aims. In this paper, we provide an overview of the abundances of sulphur-bearing
   species in hot Jupiter atmospheres under different conditions and explore their 
   observability.
   Methods. We used the photochemical kinetics code VULCAN to model hot Jupiter
   atmospheric disequilibrium chemistry. Transmission spectra for these atmospheres 
   were created using the modelling framework ARCiS. We varied model parameters 
   such as the diffusion coefficient Kzz, and we studied the importance of 
   photochemistry on the resulting mixing ratios. Furthermore, we varied the 
   chemical composition of the atmosphere by increasing the metallicity from solar 
   to ten times solar. We also explored different C/O ratios.
   Results. We find that H2S and SO2 are the best candidates for detection between 
   1 and 10 μm, using a spectral resolution that is representative of the 
   instruments on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). H2S is easiest to 
   detect at an equilibrium temperature of ~1500 K, and with C/O ratios between 
   0.7 and 0.9, with the ideal value increasing slightly for increasing metallicity. 
   SO2 is most likely to be detected at an equilibrium temperature of ~1000 K at 
   low C/O ratios and high metallicities. Nevertheless, among these two molecules, 
   we expect SO2 detection to be more common, as it is detectable in scenarios more 
   favoured by formation models.
   Conclusions. We conclude that H2S and SO2 will most likely be detected in the 
   coming years with the JWST, and that the detection of these species will provide 
   information on atmospheric processes and planet formation scenarios.}

   broadened absorption line width will be comparable to the spectral

   to spectroscopic measurements for the first time. We conclude that
   reasonable precision and high-resolution spectroscopic measurements are
   key to explaining the origin of MIF-S at column densities below 10(18)

As a result of synthesis imaging, high intensity regions of SO2 were found to be associated with the volcanically active areas around the Amaterasu Patera (305°W, 38°N) and around the Janus Patera (36°W, 4°S) and Kanehekili Fluctus (32°W, 17°S). By fitting the spectral lineshapes, the main and redshifted spectral components are identified around the Amaterasu Patera. The redshifted component can be attributed as the emission from the plume gas moving away in the line of sight. The rotational temperature and column density of SO2 were derived by employing the population diagram plots with spectral line intensities. The column densities of SO2 before ingress are (2.2 ± 1.1) × 1015 cm−2 around the Amaterasu Patera and (2.2 ± 1.1) × 1015 cm−2 around the Janus Patera. After ingress, the column densities are (1.8 ± 1.2) × 1015 cm−2 and (2.1 ± 0.1) × 1015 cm−2, respectively. This suggests that volcanic eruptions maintain the atmospheres in these regions during eclipse. The temperature around the Amaterasu Patera of 95 ± 28 K before ingress is similar to the temperature of 108 ± 48 K after ingress. On the other hand, the temperature around the Janus Patera increases from 151 ± 70 K before ingress to 311 ± 41 K after ingress. The result suggests that the atmospheric SO2 around the Janus Patera after ingress may be supplied by evaporation from the lava areas.}

   the rigorous variational method is employed for the first time to
   describe the molecular vibrations. In addition, we present a new robust
   approach to generating rotational energy surfaces for vibrationally
   excited states; this is done in a fully quantum-mechanical, variational
   manner. The semi-classical approach of the present work is applied to
   calculating the energies of very highly excited rotational states and it
   reduces dramatically the computing time as well as the storage and

   the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. By presenting
   and modelling a large number of SO and SO2 lines in the low mass-loss rate M-type
   AGB star R Dor, and modelling the available lines of those molecules in a further
   four M-type AGB stars, we aim to determine their circumstellar abundances and
   distributions. We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated
   lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and SO2 line emission and molecular
   data files for both SO and SO2 that are more extensive than those previously
   available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2 lines to constrain our models for R Dor,
   we find an SO abundance of 6.7e−6 and an SO2 abundance of 5e−6 with both species
   having high abundances close to the star. We also modelled 34SO and found an
   abundance of 3.1e−7, giving an 32SO/34SO ratio of 21.6. We derive similar results
   for the circumstellar SO and SO2 abundances and their distributions for the
   low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the circumstellar SO and SO2
   abundances are much higher than predicted by chemical models and these two
   species may account for all available sulphur. For the higher mass-loss rate
   stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with peak abundances that decrease
   and peak abundance radii that increase with increasing mass-loss rate.
   The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very well with the photodissociation
   radii of H2O. We find evidence that SO is most likely through the photodissociation
   of H2O and the subsequent reaction between S and OH. The S-bearing parent
   molecule appears not to be H2S. The SO2 models suggest an origin close to the
   star for this species, also disagreeing with current chemical models.},

   implies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their

   sulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also find
   that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical formation

   intersystem crossing from the excited singlet ((A) over tilde
   (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) states. The observed MIF signature
   differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific
   absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength
   region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF
   originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states

   320 nm at 293 K with a resolution of 8 cm(-1). This is the first
   reported measurement of the (SO2)-S-36 cross-section. This work improves
   earlier measurements of the (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33 and (SO2)-S-34
   cross-sections and is in good agreement concerning fine structure and
   peak widths, with localized differences at the peak maxima when isotope
   effects are taken into account. SO2 samples were produced in an
   identical process via combustion of isotopically enriched S-0,
   eliminating effects due to variation in oxygen isotopic composition.
   Peak positions for the rare isotopologues are red shifted relative to
   the (SO2)-S-32 isotopologue. Starting at the origin the shift increases
   linearly through the band. A linear shift model based on the spectrum of
   (SO2)-S-32 was used to estimate the cross-sections of (SO2)-S-33,34,36;
   the average of the wavelength resolved absolute difference between the
   modeled and experimental spectra is 77.4, 107 and 139 parts per thousand
   respectively. While the peak-to-valley amplitude of (SO2)-S-36 tends to
   be smaller than the other isotopologues throughout the spectrum,
   integrated band intensities for all isotopologues are conserved to
   within 4\% relative to (SO2)-S-32. The cross-sections were used in a
   photochemical model to obtain fractionation constants to compare with
   photochemical chamber experiments. We conclude that planetary
   atmospheres will exhibit isotopic fractionation from both
   photoexcitation and photodissociation, and that experiments in the
   literature have isotopic imprints arising from both the
   (BB1)-B-1-X(1)A(1) and the (CB1)-B-1-X(1)A(1) bands. Citation:

ample statistics to study the behavior of these gases above Venus’ clouds.
The instrument (a set of three spectrometers) is capable to sound atmospheric
structure above the clouds in several observation modes (nadir, solar and stellar
occultations) either in the UV or in the near IR spectral ranges. We present
the results from solar occultations in the absorption ranges of SO2 (190–230 nm,
and at 4 μm) and SO (190–230 nm). The dioxide was detected by the SOIR spectrometer
at the altitudes of 65–80 km in the IR and by the SPICAV spectrometer at 85–105
km in the UV. The monoxide’s absorption was measured only by SPICAV at 85–105 km.
We analyzed 39 sessions of solar occultation, where boresights of both spectrometers
are oriented identically, to provide complete vertical profiling of SO2 of the
Venus’ mesosphere (65–105 km). Here we report the first firm detection and measurements
of two SO2 layers. In the lower layer SO2 mixing ratio is within 0.02–0.5 ppmv.
The upper layer, also conceivable from microwave measurements by Sandor et al.
(Sandor, B.J., Todd Clancy, R., Moriarty-Schieven, G., Mills, F.P. [2010].
Icarus 208, 49–60) is characterized by SO2 increasing with the altitude from 0.05
to 2 ppmv, and the [SO2]/[SO] ratio varying from 1 to 5. The presence of
the high-altitude SOx species could be explained by H2SO4 photodissociation
under somewhat warmer temperature conditions in Venus mesosphere. At 90–100 km
the content of the sulfur dioxide correlates with temperature increasing from
0.1 ppmv at 165–170 K to 0.5–1 ppmv at 190–192 K. It supports the hypothesis of
SO2 production by the evaporation of H2SO4 from droplets and its subsequent
photolysis at around 100 km.},

uncertainties are quantified for GOME-2 SO2 amounts; these are dominated by uncertainty
contributions from noise, surface albedo, profile shape, correlations with other
retrieved parameters, atmospheric temperature, choice of wavelength fitting window,
and aerosols. When plume altitudes are also simultaneously retrieved, additional
significant uncertainties result from uncertainties in the a priori altitude, the
model's vertical layer resolution, and instrument calibration. Retrieved plume
height information content is examined using the Mount Kasatochi volcanic plume

   sulfur volatiles that were degassed into the Martian atmosphere may have
   caused a greenhouse effect early in the planet's history. It remains
   unclear, however, over what timescales warming from sulfur volatiles
   would have persisted, and consequently how significant this warming may
   have been. While most photochemistry research to date has concentrated
   on current Martian conditions, the ancient Martian atmosphere was
   thicker, warmer, and more reducing than the current regime. Here we
   investigate sulfur photochemistry in a 500 mb ancient Martian
   atmosphere. After adapting a model used to study sulfur photochemistry
   on Earth during the Archean, we find a short lifetime for SO2 in the
   current Martian atmosphere, similar to results of other photochemical
   studies. However, our simulations suggest that moderate mixing ratios of
   SO2 (10(-8) <= f(SO2) <= 10(-6)) could have persisted in the ancient
   Martian atmosphere for hundreds of years, generating short but potent

   degassing measurements available for this remote volcano, which dominated regional

   increasing SO2 burdens in the months prior to explosive eruptions of the volcano

  abstract = {On the basis of observations of the most abundant sulfur-bearing
molecules (H2S, CS, NS, SO, H2CS, OCS, and SO2) carried out with the IRAM 30 m
telescope and the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST), we present the
first analysis of the sulfur chemistry of an extragalactic source, the nuclear
region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. This is the first time that H2S and,
tentatively, H2CS are detected toward the nucleus of a starburst galaxy.
Source-averaged fractional abundances of these molecules are a few times 10-9,
except for CS and OCS, which are more abundant (10-8). Sulfur isotopic ratios,
32S/34S ~ 8 ± 2 and 34S/33S > 9, are measured through observations of 13CS,
C34S, and C33S. A comparison with the observed relative abundances toward different
prototypical Galactic sources suggests that the chemical composition of NGC 253
is similar to that found toward molecular cloud complexes like Sgr B2 in the
nuclear region of the Milky Way. The large overabundance of OCS compared with
the predictions of time-dependent sulfur chemistry models supports the idea that
OCS is likely to have been injected into the gas phase from grain mantles by
low-velocity shocks.},

  volume = {176},
  pages = {283-304},
  abstract = {We have observed about 16 absorption lines of the ν2ν2 SO2 vibrational band on
Io, in disk-integrated 19-μm spectra taken with the TEXES high spectral resolution
mid-infrared spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in November 2001,
December 2002, and January 2004. These are the first ground-based infrared observations
of Io's sunlit atmosphere, and provide a new window on the atmosphere that allows
better longitudinal and temporal monitoring than previous techniques. Dramatic
variations in band strength with longitude are seen that are stable over at least
a 2 year period. The depth of the strongest feature, a blend of lines centered
at 530.42 cm−1, varies from about 7% near longitude 180° to about 1% near longitude
315° W, as measured at a spectral resolution of 57,000. Interpretation of the
spectra requires modeling of surface temperatures and atmospheric density across
Io's disk, and the variation in non-LTE ν2ν2 vibrational temperature with altitude,
and depends on the assumed atmospheric and surface temperature structure. About
half of Io's 19-μm radiation comes from the Sun-heated surface, and half from
volcanic hot spots with temperatures primarily between 150 and 200 K, which occupy
about 8% of the surface. The observations are thus weighted towards the atmosphere
over these low-temperature hot spots. If we assume that the atmosphere over the
hot spots is representative of the atmosphere elsewhere, and that the atmospheric
density is a function of latitude, the most plausible interpretation of the data
is that the equatorial atmospheric column density varies from
about 1.5×1017 cm−21.5×1017 cm−2 near longitude 180° W to about 1.5×1016 cm−21.5×1016 cm−2 near longitude 300° W,
roughly consistent with HST UV spectroscopy and Lyman-α imaging. The inferred
atmospheric kinetic temperature is less than about 150 K, at least on the anti-Jupiter
hemisphere where the bands are strongest, somewhat colder than inferred from HST UV
spectroscopy and millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy. This longitudinal variability
in atmospheric density correlates with the longitudinal variability in the abundance
of optically thick, near-UV bright SO2 frost. However it is not clear whether the
correlation results from volcanic control (regions of large frost abundance result
from greater condensation of atmospheric gases supported by more vigorous volcanic
activity in these regions) or sublimation control (regions of large frost abundance
produce a more extensive atmosphere due to more extensive sublimation). Comparison
of data taken in 2001, 2002, and 2004 shows that with the possible exception of
longitudes near 180° W between 2001 and 2002, Io's atmospheric density does not
appear to decrease as Io recedes from the Sun, as would be expected if the atmosphere
were supported by the sublimation of surface frost, suggesting that the atmosphere
is dominantly supported by direct volcanic supply rather than by frost sublimation.
However, other evidence such as the smooth variation in atmospheric abundance with
latitude, and atmospheric changes during eclipse, suggest that sublimation support
is more important than volcanic support, leaving the question of the dominant atmospheric
support mechanism still unresolved.},

  abstract = {The sulphur chemistry in nine regions in the earliest stages of
high-mass star formation is studied through single-dish submillimeter spectroscopy.
The line profiles indicate that 10-50% of the SO and SO 2 emission arises in
high-velocity gas, either infalling or outflowing. For the low-velocity gas,
excitation temperatures are 25 K for H 2S, 50 K for SO, H 2CS, NS and HCS +,
and 100 K for OCS and SO 2, indicating that most observed emission traces the
outer parts ( T<100 K) of the molecular envelopes, except high-excitation OCS
and SO 2 lines. Abundances in the outer envelopes, calculated with a Monte
Carlo program, using the physical structures of the sources derived from
previous submillimeter continuum and CS line data, are ~10 -8 for OCS, ~10 -9
for H 2S, H 2CS, SO and SO 2, and ~10 -10 for HCS + and NS. In the inner
envelopes ( T>100 K) of six sources, the SO 2 abundance is enhanced by a
factor of ~100-1000. This region of hot, abundant SO 2 has been seen before
in infrared absorption, and must be small, $\la$0 $\farcs$2 (180 AU radius).
The derived abundance profiles are consistent with models of envelope chemistry
which invoke ice evaporation at $T\sim 100$  K. Shock chemistry is unlikely to
contribute. A major sulphur carrier in the ices is probably OCS, not H 2S as
most models assume. The source-to-source abundance variations of most molecules
by factors of ~10 do not correlate with previous systematic tracers of envelope
heating. Without observations of H 2S and SO lines probing warm ( $\ga$100 K)
gas, sulphur-bearing molecules cannot be used as evolutionary tracers during
star formation.},

  stars, UX Cyg, o Cet and T Cep, and marginally detected in at least four other stars.
  The band is seen in absorption in UX Cyg, while it is in emission in o Cet.
  Seven spectra of T Cep taken at different phases show that the feature changes
  from emission to absorption on a time scale of twice the pulsation period. Using
  an LTE model, we find that the excitation temperature of SO_2 is typically 600 K,
  and that in T Cep the molecule occupies a region with dimensions of several stellar
  radii. The total number of molecules contained in this region is of order 10(47),
  which requires a local gas density of at least 10(9) H_2 cm(-3) , and possibly up
  to 10(11) H_2 cm(-3) depending on the SO_2 abundance. The variation with phase of
  the T Cep spectra can be explained by photodissociation of SO_2 molecules by soft UV photons.

about volcanic plumes because of its contiguous spatial mapping and use of UV
wavelengths. The accuracies of TOMS sulfur dioxide retrievals, volcanic plume masses,
and eruption totals under low-latitude conditions are evaluated using radiative
transfer simulations and error analysis. The retrieval algorithm is a simultaneous
solution of the absorption optical depth equations including ozone and sulfur
dioxide at the four shortest TOMS wavelengths and an empirical correction based
on background condition residuals. The retrieval algorithm reproduces model
stratospheric sulfur dioxide plume amounts within ±10% over most central scan
angles and moderate solar zenith angles if no aerosols or ash are present. The
errors grow to 30% under large solar zenith angle conditions. Volcanic ash and
sulfate aerosols in the plume in moderate optical depths (0.3) produce an overestimation
of the sulfur dioxide by 15–25% depending on particle size and composition.
Retrievals of tropospheric volcanic plumes are affected by the reflectivity of
the underlying surface or clouds. The precision of individual TOMS SO2 soundings
is limited by data quantization to ±6 Dobson units. The accuracy is independent
of most instrument calibration errors but depends linearly on relative SO2 absorption
cross-section errors at the TOMS wavelengths. Volcanic plume mass estimates are
dependent on correction of background offsets integrated over the plume area.
The errors vary with plume mass and area, thus are highly individual. In general,
they are least for moderate size, compact plumes. Estimates of the total mass of
explosively erupted sulfur dioxide depend on extrapolation of a series of daily
plume masses backward to the time of the eruption. Errors of 15–30% are not unusual.
Effusive eruption total mass estimates are more uncertain due to difficulties
in separating new from old sulfur dioxide in daily observations.},

   of SO2 ice films has been measured at 20 and 88°K before and after 1-MeV proton
   irradiation. The radiation flux was chosen to simulate the estimated flux of
   Jovian magnetospheric 1-MeV protons incident on Io. After irradiation, SO3 is
   identified as the dominant molecule synthesized in the SO2 ice. This is also the
   case after irradiation of composite samples of SO2 with sulfur, or disulfites.
   Darkening was observed in irradiated SO2 ice and in irradiated S8 pellets.
   Photometric and spectral measurements of the thermoluminescence of irradiated SO2
   have been made during warming. The spectrum appears as a broad band with a maximum
   at 4450 Å. Analysis of the luminescence data suggests that, at Ionian temperatures,
   irradiated SO2 ice would not be a dominant contributor to posteclipse brightening
   phenomena. After warming to room temperature, a form of SO3 remains along with a
   sulfate and S8. Based on these experiments, it is reasonable to propose that small
   amounts of SO3 may exist on the surface of Io as a result of irradiation synthesis
   in SO2 frosts.},

   dispersed in westerly winds while persistent stratospheric clouds drifted in easterly
   winds at speeds up to 13 meters per second. The spectral reflectance is consistent
   with sulfur dioxide absorption and rules out carbon disulfide as a major constituent.

  pages = {784-786},
  abstract = {Twenty spectra of Io (0.26 to 0.33 micrometer), acquired with the
   International Ultraviolet Explorer spacecraft, have been studied. There is a strong
   ultraviolet absorption shortward of 0.33 micrometer that is consistent with earlier
   ground-based spectrophotometry; its strength is strongly dependent on Io's rotational
   phase angle at the time of observation. This spectral feature and its variation are
   interpreted as indicative of a longitudinal variation in the distribution of sulfur
   dioxide frost on Io. The frost is most abundant at orbital longitudes 72° to 137°
   and least abundant at longitudes 250° to 323°. Variations in spectral reflectivity
   between 0.4 and 0.5 micrometer, reported in earlier ground-based spectral studies,
   correlate inversely with variations in reflectivity between 0.26 and 0.33 micrometer.
   It is concluded that this is because the Io surface component with the highest visible
   reflectivity (sulfur dioxide frost) has the lowest ultraviolet reflectivity. At least
   one other component is present and may be sulfur allotropes or alkali sulfides.
   This model is consistent with ground-based ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrophotometry.
   Comparison with Voyager color photographs indicates that the sulfur dioxide frost is in
   greatest concentration in the "white" areas on Io and the other sulfurous components
   are in greatest concentration in the "red" areas.},
