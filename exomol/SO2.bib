abstract = "The quality of Ames-296K SO2 Infrared (IR) line list intensities is first validated by quantitative exploration of several dipole moment surfaces (DMSs) and partition sum convergence. The DMSs are computed with several of Dunning's correlation-consistent basis sets and their vibrational dependence are compared to the empirical model derived from Stark effect experiments reported by D. Patel, D. Margolese, and T.R. Dyke [J. Chem. Phys. 70, 2740 (1979)]. The effective dipole deviations from the DMS adopted in the Ames IR lists is 0.2–0.4\% for vibrational states up to 3ν3. The vibrational dependence of the dipole moment is also in good agreement, except for nν1. Partition sum convergence at 296 K is confirmed by new calculations with rotational quantum number J up to 150 and upper state E’ up to 8000 cm−1. The isotopologue consistency of the Ames IR line lists is superior relative to the regular Effective Hamiltonian (EH) models and Effective Dipole Moment (EDM) models. The ν1 + ν2 and ν2 + ν3 intensity consistency check reveals the recently reported experimental intensities need significant improvement or re-analysis. After the accuracy, convergence, and isotopologue consistency have been confirmed, the theoretical Ames-296K intensities are combined with the experimental line positions or EH models that experimental spectroscopists published after 2009. Three high-resolution IR line sets are reported for the 32/33/34S16O2, 32S18O2 and 16O32S18O isotopologues: (1) the “New Lines Sets” include experimentally measured line positions; (2) the “Expanded Line Sets” include possible transitions among new rovibrational levels assigned in experiments and ground state (GS) levels predicted by reliable EH models; (3) the “Ames + MARVEL Sets” include possible transitions among all those levels reported in a recent MARVEL analysis. [Tóbiás et al, JQSRT 208, 152 (2018)]. Compared to the limited data in High-resolution TRANsmission molecular absorption database (HITRAN), these line sets have significantly improved the data coverage up to 4000 cm−1. Some missing bands can be traced to the unpublished experimental data. The isotopologue consistency of these line sets will help identify the uncertainties and defects in the experimental EH and EDM models. These line sets are good candidates for the next HITRAN update, if line shape parameters are available. The line sets can be downloaded from supplementary files or from the Ames Molecular Spectroscopic Database at http://huang.seti.org."

   band origins is similar to what has been reported for the main
   isotopologue, i.e. 0.01-0.03 cm(-1) for bands up to 5500 cm(-1). For
   rovibrational transitions, the 646 line position and intensity deviation
   patterns are much simpler and more self-consistent than those of the

   K-a/J transitions. 626 and 646 exhibit comparable line position and
   intensity agreement for lower ICall transitions. The line position
   deviations for the 636 purely rotational band are parallel to those of
   626 and 646, while its line intensity deviations do not show branching
   patterns as we found in the 626 and 646 cases. Predictions for the other
   minor isotopologues are expected to exhibit similar accuracy. These line
   lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives for missing bands of
   626 and the minor isotopologues. It may significantly facilitate the
   laboratory spectroscopic measurement and analysis, as well as to
   identify these isotopologues in various astrophysical environments.},

   We report the production of large sulfur isotope MIF, with Delta S-33 up

   in the 250-350-nm absorption region. Acetylene is used to selectively

   intersystem crossing from the excited singlet ((A) over tilde
   (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) states. The observed MIF signature
   differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific
   absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength
   region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF
   originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states
   but from an isotope selective spin-orbit interaction between the singlet
   ((A) over tilde (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) and triplet ((a) over
   tilde B-3(1)) manifolds. Calculations based on high-level potential

   levels of the (A) over tilde (1)A(2) state. These results demonstrate
   that the isotope selectivity of accidental near-resonance interactions

The band is seen in absorption in UX Cyg, while it is in emission in o Cet.
Seven spectra of T Cep taken at different phases show that the feature changes
from emission to absorption on a time scale of twice the pulsation period. Using
an LTE model, we find that the excitation temperature of SO_2 is typically 600 K,
and that in T Cep the molecule occupies a region with dimensions of several stellar
radii. The total number of molecules contained in this region is of order 10(47),
which requires a local gas density of at least 10(9) H_2 cm(-3) , and possibly up
to 10(11) H_2 cm(-3) depending on the SO_2 abundance. The variation with phase of
the T Cep spectra can be explained by photodissociation of SO_2 molecules by soft UV photons.

   previously reported limits, whereas for H2S we set a more stringent

   Among the targeted molecules, SO2 is the strongest indicator for
   volcanic outgassing. Assuming a photochemical lifetime of 2 years for
   SO2, our upper limit of 1.1 ppb implies an outgassing rate less than 55

   less than 12,000 m(3). Our sensitivity is sufficient to detect a

first analysis of the sulfur chemistry of an extragalactic source, the nuclear
region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. This is the first time that H2S and,
tentatively, H2CS are detected toward the nucleus of a starburst galaxy.
Source-averaged fractional abundances of these molecules are a few times 10-9,
except for CS and OCS, which are more abundant (10-8). Sulfur isotopic ratios,
32S/34S ~ 8 ± 2 and 34S/33S > 9, are measured through observations of 13CS,
C34S, and C33S. A comparison with the observed relative abundances toward different
prototypical Galactic sources suggests that the chemical composition of NGC 253
is similar to that found toward molecular cloud complexes like Sgr B2 in the
nuclear region of the Milky Way. The large overabundance of OCS compared with
the predictions of time-dependent sulfur chemistry models supports the idea that
OCS is likely to have been injected into the gas phase from grain mantles by
low-velocity shocks.},

Pages = {12274},
Abstract = {Mass loss from evolved stars results in the formation of unusual
chemical laboratories: circumstellar envelopes. Such envelopes are found around
carbon- and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants.
As the gaseous material of the envelope flows from the star, the resulting
temperature and density gradients create a complex chemical environment involving
hot, thermodynamically controlled synthesis, molecule “freeze-out,” shock-initiated
reactions, and photochemistry governed by radical mechanisms. In the circumstellar
envelope of the carbon-rich star IRC+10216, >50 different chemical compounds have
been identified, including such exotic species as C8H, C3S, SiC3, and AlNC.
The chemistry here is dominated by molecules containing long carbon chains,
silicon, and metals such as magnesium, sodium, and aluminum, which makes it quite
distinct from that found in molecular clouds. The molecular composition of the
oxygen-rich counterparts is not nearly as well explored, although recent studies
of VY Canis Majoris have resulted in the identification of HCO+, SO2, and even
NaCl in this object, suggesting chemical complexity here as well. As these
envelopes evolve into planetary nebulae with a hot, exposed central star,
synthesis of molecular ions becomes important, as indicated by studies of
NGC 7027. Numerous species such as HCO+, HCN, and CCH are found in old planetary
nebulae such as the Helix. This “survivor” molecular material may be linked to
the variety of compounds found recently in diffuse clouds. Organic molecules
in dense interstellar clouds may ultimately be traced back to carbon-rich
fragments originally formed in circumstellar shells.},

ultraviolet absorption shortward of 0.33 micrometer that is consistent with earlier
ground-based spectrophotometry; its strength is strongly dependent on Io's rotational
phase angle at the time of observation. This spectral feature and its variation are
interpreted as indicative of a longitudinal variation in the distribution of sulfur
dioxide frost on Io. The frost is most abundant at orbital longitudes 72° to 137°
and least abundant at longitudes 250° to 323°. Variations in spectral reflectivity
between 0.4 and 0.5 micrometer, reported in earlier ground-based spectral studies,
correlate inversely with variations in reflectivity between 0.26 and 0.33 micrometer.
It is concluded that this is because the Io surface component with the highest visible
reflectivity (sulfur dioxide frost) has the lowest ultraviolet reflectivity. At least
one other component is present and may be sulfur allotropes or alkali sulfides.
This model is consistent with ground-based ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrophotometry.
Comparison with Voyager color photographs indicates that the sulfur dioxide frost is in
greatest concentration in the "white" areas on Io and the other sulfurous components
are in greatest concentration in the "red" areas.},

groups of hyperfine components of NO and five of NS were detected. All three species
show large abundances averaged over the inner 200 pc of NGC 253 . With a relative
abundance of a few 10-7, the emission of the NO molecule is similar or even larger
than that found in Galactic star forming regions. The derived relative molecular
abundances for each molecule have been compared with those of prototypical Galactic
molecular clouds. These results seem to confirm that large scale shocks dominate
the chemistry of these molecules in the nucleus of NGC 253 , ruling out a chemistry
dominated by PDRs for the bulk of the gas.},

Pages = {133},
Abstract = {The sulphur chemistry in nine regions in the earliest stages of
high-mass star formation is studied through single-dish submillimeter spectroscopy.
The line profiles indicate that 10-50% of the SO and SO 2 emission arises in
high-velocity gas, either infalling or outflowing. For the low-velocity gas,
excitation temperatures are 25 K for H 2S, 50 K for SO, H 2CS, NS and HCS +,
and 100 K for OCS and SO 2, indicating that most observed emission traces the
outer parts ( T<100 K) of the molecular envelopes, except high-excitation OCS
and SO 2 lines. Abundances in the outer envelopes, calculated with a Monte
Carlo program, using the physical structures of the sources derived from
previous submillimeter continuum and CS line data, are ~10 -8 for OCS, ~10 -9
for H 2S, H 2CS, SO and SO 2, and ~10 -10 for HCS + and NS. In the inner
envelopes ( T>100 K) of six sources, the SO 2 abundance is enhanced by a
factor of ~100-1000. This region of hot, abundant SO 2 has been seen before
in infrared absorption, and must be small, $\la$0 $\farcs$2 (180 AU radius).
The derived abundance profiles are consistent with models of envelope chemistry
which invoke ice evaporation at $T\sim 100$  K. Shock chemistry is unlikely to
contribute. A major sulphur carrier in the ices is probably OCS, not H 2S as
most models assume. The source-to-source abundance variations of most molecules
by factors of ~10 do not correlate with previous systematic tracers of envelope
heating. Without observations of H 2S and SO lines probing warm ( $\ga$100 K)
gas, sulphur-bearing molecules cannot be used as evolutionary tracers during
star formation.},

Abstract = {Thermochemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations are used to model
sulfur and phosphorus chemistry in giant planets, brown dwarfs, and extrasolar giant

condensates is determined as a function of pressure, temperature, and metallicity.
The results are independent of particular model atmospheres, and in principle,
the equilibrium composition along the pressure-temperature profile of any object
can be determined. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the dominant S-bearing gas throughout
substellar atmospheres and approximately represents the atmospheric sulfur inventory.
Silicon sulfide (SiS) is a potential tracer of weather in substellar atmospheres.
Disequilibrium abundances of phosphine (PH3) approximately representative of the
total atmospheric phosphorus inventory are expected to be mixed upward into the
observable atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. In hotter objects, several
P-bearing gases (e.g., P2, PH3, PH 2, PH, and HCP) become increasingly important
at high temperatures.},

Apart from the abundant diatomic rotors such as CO, CS, SO, the spectrum is dominated
by CH3OH and SO2, both in terms of numbers of lines and integrated flux. The number
of unidentified lines is 155 or 14%. We also report the tentative identification
of the new molecule SiH in our data. For some complex organic molecules, we find
rotation temperatures and column densities which are much higher than those found
in earlier studies. It is likely the cause of this is a significant contribution
from a very compact, hot component of the Orion molecular cloud core which was not
visible in lower frequency surveys.},

N = 6-10 × 1015 cm-2 and Tgas = 110-500 K fit the data, with preference for temperatures

That allowed us to record not only the ν1ν1 and ν3ν3 bands with higher values of

became clear in the course of the analysis, the rotational parameters of the ground
vibrational state, known in the literature, do not describe suitably the ground
state combination differences (GSCD) for the states with the value Ka>26–27Ka>26–27.
As a consequence, the ground state rotational parameters were improved on the basis
of our experimental data. The 12 131 transitions assigned in the experimental
spectrum (7618, 3952, and 561 transitions of the bands ν1ν1, ν3ν3, and 2ν22ν2,

Resonance interactions between all three vibrational states have been taken into

obtained from the fit, reproduce 4063 ro-vibrational energies of the states (100), (001),

Abstract = {The room temperature high resolution infrared spectrum of the 2ν3 band

spectrometer and completely analyzed. The rotational levels of the upper state (002)
have been reproduced to an accuracy of ±0.00008 cm−1 using a Hamiltonian matrix
which explicitly takes into account the weak Fermi-type interaction coupling the
rotational levels of the (002) state with those of the (130) state yielding a
band origin ν0 = 2713.382660(6) cm|−1 and a complete set of rotational constants
and a Fermi-type interaction constant. This band exhibits a pronounced Herman-Wallis
effect. However, the intensities have been very satisfactorily fit leading to a
precise vibrational transition moment for the 2ν3 band. Finally, a comprehensive
set of line positions and intensities has been generated. For this band, the integrated
band intensity has been found to be Sv (T = 296 K) 9.81(20) × 10−5 cm−1 Pa−1 m−1 (0.0995(20) cm−2 atm−1).
A set of harmonic frequencies and vibrational anharmonic constants have been obtained.
The effects of Darling-Dennison interaction appear to be very small.},

Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {176},
Pages = {283-304},
Abstract = {We have observed about 16 absorption lines of the ν2ν2 SO2 vibrational band on
Io, in disk-integrated 19-μm spectra taken with the TEXES high spectral resolution
mid-infrared spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in November 2001,
December 2002, and January 2004. These are the first ground-based infrared observations
of Io's sunlit atmosphere, and provide a new window on the atmosphere that allows
better longitudinal and temporal monitoring than previous techniques. Dramatic
variations in band strength with longitude are seen that are stable over at least
a 2 year period. The depth of the strongest feature, a blend of lines centered
at 530.42 cm−1, varies from about 7% near longitude 180° to about 1% near longitude
315° W, as measured at a spectral resolution of 57,000. Interpretation of the
spectra requires modeling of surface temperatures and atmospheric density across
Io's disk, and the variation in non-LTE ν2ν2 vibrational temperature with altitude,
and depends on the assumed atmospheric and surface temperature structure. About
half of Io's 19-μm radiation comes from the Sun-heated surface, and half from
volcanic hot spots with temperatures primarily between 150 and 200 K, which occupy
about 8% of the surface. The observations are thus weighted towards the atmosphere
over these low-temperature hot spots. If we assume that the atmosphere over the
hot spots is representative of the atmosphere elsewhere, and that the atmospheric
density is a function of latitude, the most plausible interpretation of the data
is that the equatorial atmospheric column density varies from
about 1.5×1017 cm−21.5×1017 cm−2 near longitude 180° W to about 1.5×1016 cm−21.5×1016 cm−2 near longitude 300° W,
roughly consistent with HST UV spectroscopy and Lyman-α imaging. The inferred
atmospheric kinetic temperature is less than about 150 K, at least on the anti-Jupiter
hemisphere where the bands are strongest, somewhat colder than inferred from HST UV
spectroscopy and millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy. This longitudinal variability
in atmospheric density correlates with the longitudinal variability in the abundance
of optically thick, near-UV bright SO2 frost. However it is not clear whether the
correlation results from volcanic control (regions of large frost abundance result
from greater condensation of atmospheric gases supported by more vigorous volcanic
activity in these regions) or sublimation control (regions of large frost abundance
produce a more extensive atmosphere due to more extensive sublimation). Comparison
of data taken in 2001, 2002, and 2004 shows that with the possible exception of
longitudes near 180° W between 2001 and 2002, Io's atmospheric density does not
appear to decrease as Io recedes from the Sun, as would be expected if the atmosphere
were supported by the sublimation of surface frost, suggesting that the atmosphere
is dominantly supported by direct volcanic supply rather than by frost sublimation.
However, other evidence such as the smooth variation in atmospheric abundance with
latitude, and atmospheric changes during eclipse, suggest that sublimation support
is more important than volcanic support, leaving the question of the dominant atmospheric
support mechanism still unresolved.},

essential for obtaining reliable molecular geometries. The differential effect
of core correlation on computed properties is in fact much less important.
The CCSD(T) one-particle basis set limit for the symmetric stretching frequencies
appears to be higher than the exact value, while the antisymmetric stretching
frequency benefits from an error cancellation. The basis set extension effects
of diffuse functions and inner polarization functions appear to be nearly
perfectly additive. Our best computed atomization energies and geometries agree
to within 0.1 kcal/mol, 0.0004 Angstrom, and 0.03 degrees with experiment:

Abstract = {The ultraviolet absorption cross sections of the SO2 isotopologues are
   essential to understanding the photochemical fractionation of sulfur
   isotopes in planetary atmospheres. We present measurements of the
   absorption cross sections of (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, (SO2)-S-34, and
   (SO2)-S-36, recorded from 190 to 220nm at room temperature with a
   resolution of 0.1nm (25cm(-1)) made using a dual-beam photospectrometer.
   The measured absorption cross sections show an apparent pressure
   dependence and a newly developed analytical model shows that this is
   caused by underresolved fine structure. The model made possible the
   calculation of absorption cross sections at the zero-pressure limit that
   can be used to calculate photolysis rates for atmospheric scenarios. The
   (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, and (SO2)-S-34 cross sections improve upon
   previously published spectra including fine structure and peak widths.
   This is the first report of absolute absorption cross sections of the
   (SO2)-S-36 isotopologue for the (CB2)-B-1-X(1)A(2) band where the
   amplitude of the vibrational structure is smaller than the other
   isotopologues throughout the spectrum. Based on the new results, solar
   UV photodissociation of SO2 produces (34)epsilon, (33), and (36)
   isotopic fractionations of +4.611.6, +8.89.0, and -8.8 +/- 19.6 parts
   per thousand, respectively. From these spectra isotopic effects during
   photolysis in the Archean atmosphere can be calculated and compared to
   the Archean sedimentary record. Our results suggest that broadband solar
   UV photolysis is capable of producing the mass-independent fractionation
   observed in the Archean sedimentary record without involving shielding
   by specific gaseous compounds in the atmosphere including SO2 itself.
   The estimated magnitude of (33), for example, is close to the maximum
   S-33 observed in the geological record.},

   peak widths, with localized differences at the peak maxima when isotope
   effects are taken into account. SO2 samples were produced in an
   identical process via combustion of isotopically enriched S-0,
   eliminating effects due to variation in oxygen isotopic composition.
   Peak positions for the rare isotopologues are red shifted relative to
   the (SO2)-S-32 isotopologue. Starting at the origin the shift increases
   linearly through the band. A linear shift model based on the spectrum of
   (SO2)-S-32 was used to estimate the cross-sections of (SO2)-S-33,34,36;
   the average of the wavelength resolved absolute difference between the
   modeled and experimental spectra is 77.4, 107 and 139 parts per thousand
   respectively. While the peak-to-valley amplitude of (SO2)-S-36 tends to
   be smaller than the other isotopologues throughout the spectrum,
   integrated band intensities for all isotopologues are conserved to
   within 4\% relative to (SO2)-S-32. The cross-sections were used in a
   photochemical model to obtain fractionation constants to compare with
   photochemical chamber experiments. We conclude that planetary

The bands are all highly perturbed type C bands, which go to b2 vibrational levels
of the ππ* Ã1A2 electronic state. The electronic transition shows an anomalous
vibrational intensity distribution, which indicates that the Ã1A2 state undergoes
strong Born–Oppenheimer (nuclear momentum) vibronic coupling with the electronic state.
All the obvious banded structure in this wavelength region can be assigned to the transition.
Although no analyses of bands belonging to the transition have been carried
out (since the state is so massively perturbed by the ground state), reasons
are presented for placing its (0,0) band between 3100 and 3160 Å.},

Abstract = {We present daily measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from
active volcanoes in Ecuador and southern Colombia between September 2004 and
September 2006, derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's EOS/Aura
satellite. OMI is an ultraviolet/visible spectrometer with an unprecedented combination
of spatial and spectral resolution, and global coverage, that permits daily measurements
of passive volcanic degassing from space. We use non-interactive processing methods
to automatically extract daily SO2 burdens and information on SO2 sources from the
OMI datastream. Maps of monthly average SO2 vertical columns retrieved by OMI over
Ecuador and S. Colombia are also used to illustrate variations in regional SO2
loading and to pinpoint sources. The dense concentration of active volcanoes in
Ecuador provides a stringent test of OMI's ability to distinguish SO2 from multiple
emitting sources. Our analysis reveals that Tungurahua, Reventador and Galeras
were responsible for the bulk of the SO2 emissions in the region in the timeframe
of our study, with no significant SO2 discharge detected from Sangay. At Galeras
and Reventador, we conclude that OMI can detect variations in SO2 release related
to cycles of conduit sealing and degassing, which are a critical factor in hazard
assessment. The OMI SO2 data for Reventador are the most extensive sequence of
degassing measurements available for this remote volcano, which dominated regional
SO2 production in June–August 2005. At Tungurahua, the OMI measurements span the
waning stage of one eruptive cycle and the beginning of another, and we observe
increasing SO2 burdens in the months prior to explosive eruptions of the volcano
in July and August 2006. Cumulative SO2 loadings measured by OMI yield a total
of ~ 1.16 Tg SO2 emitted by volcanoes on mainland Ecuador/S. Colombia between
September 2004 and September 2006; as much as 95% of this SO2 may originate from
non-eruptive degassing. Approximate apportionment of the total SO2 loading
indicates that ~ 40% originated from Tungurahua, with ~ 30% supplied by both
Reventador and Galeras. These measurements of volcanic SO2 degassing in Ecuador
confirm OMI's potential as an effective, economical and risk-free tool for daily
monitoring of SO2 emissions from hazardous volcanoes.},

Abstract = {The eruptions of El Chichón volcano on 28 March and 3 and 4 April 1982

absorption by volcanic gases at the shortest wavelengths of the spectrometer (312.5

dispersion, and drift of volcanic gas clouds. The tropospheric clouds were rapidly
dispersed in westerly winds while persistent stratospheric clouds drifted in easterly
winds at speeds up to 13 meters per second. The spectral reflectance is consistent
with sulfur dioxide absorption and rules out carbon disulfide as a major constituent.
A preliminary estimate of the mass of sulfur dioxide deposited in the stratosphere
by the large eruptions on 3 and 4 April is 3.3 x 106 tons. Prior estimates of
volcanic cloud volume were based on extrapolation of locally measured sulfur dioxide

Abstract = {The total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS), first flown on the
Nimbus 7 satellite, has delivered an unanticipated set of unique information
about volcanic plumes because of its contiguous spatial mapping and use of UV
wavelengths. The accuracies of TOMS sulfur dioxide retrievals, volcanic plume masses,
and eruption totals under low-latitude conditions are evaluated using radiative
transfer simulations and error analysis. The retrieval algorithm is a simultaneous
solution of the absorption optical depth equations including ozone and sulfur
dioxide at the four shortest TOMS wavelengths and an empirical correction based
on background condition residuals. The retrieval algorithm reproduces model
stratospheric sulfur dioxide plume amounts within ±10% over most central scan
angles and moderate solar zenith angles if no aerosols or ash are present. The
errors grow to 30% under large solar zenith angle conditions. Volcanic ash and
sulfate aerosols in the plume in moderate optical depths (0.3) produce an overestimation
of the sulfur dioxide by 15–25% depending on particle size and composition.
Retrievals of tropospheric volcanic plumes are affected by the reflectivity of
the underlying surface or clouds. The precision of individual TOMS SO2 soundings
is limited by data quantization to ±6 Dobson units. The accuracy is independent
of most instrument calibration errors but depends linearly on relative SO2 absorption
cross-section errors at the TOMS wavelengths. Volcanic plume mass estimates are
dependent on correction of background offsets integrated over the plume area.
The errors vary with plume mass and area, thus are highly individual. In general,
they are least for moderate size, compact plumes. Estimates of the total mass of
explosively erupted sulfur dioxide depend on extrapolation of a series of daily
plume masses backward to the time of the eruption. Errors of 15–30% are not unusual.
Effusive eruption total mass estimates are more uncertain due to difficulties
in separating new from old sulfur dioxide in daily observations.},

collisional broadening of a number of ν1 ro-vibrational lines of SO2 perturbed
by N2, O2 and He are investigated at room temperature in the 9 μm atmospheric
region by means of high resolution tunable diode laser (TDL) infrared spectroscopy.
From N2- and O2-broadening coefficients, the broadening parameters of sulfur
dioxide in air, useful for atmospheric applications, are derived as well.
From the present measurements some conclusions on the quantum number dependence
of the N2-, O2- and He-broadening coefficients are drawn. While the J dependence
is weak for all the perturbers investigated, different trends with Ka are reported.
N2-broadening coefficients show a slight decrease with increasing values of Ka,
whereas O2 and He broadening cross sections first increase up to View the MathML
sourceKa″≈6 and then they keep a nearly constant value. A comparison and a brief
discussion on the efficiency of self-, N2-, O2- and He-collisional dynamics are

pulsed mode. The spectroscopic parameters for the individual lines were determined
from the analysis of spectra measured in the pressure range between 1 and 12
Torr. The measured data of a complete pressure series were analyzed at once.
Therefore, the fit delivered directly the self-broadening coefficients and the
line intensities. The determined self-broadening coefficients are within the
uncertainties in good agreement with previously published data and confirm the
typical decrease of the self-broadening coefficient γSO2–SO2 with increasing
rotational quantum number Ka″. The broadening coefficients decrease from a
γSO2–SO2 by about 0.4 cm−1/atm for lines with small Ka″down to values of
about 0.2 cm−1/atm for lines with a Ka″>18. The line intensities determined
here were slightly smaller compared to the data listed in the HITRAN 1996
database. The deviations do not show any remarkable quantum number dependence.
The average values of the ratio SiExp/SiHITRAN 1996 were calculated to 0.83±0.02
(ν1 band) and 0.75±0.03 (ν3 band). The integrated band intensities were determined
to (3.41±0.11)×10−18 cm−1/molecule cm−2 for the ν1 band and to (2.40±0.15)×10−17
cm−1/molecule cm−2 for the ν3 band, respectively.},

analysis of pressure series in the range between 1 and 10 Torr. The determined
line intensities were significantly smaller compared to the data listed in the
HITRAN 1996 database without any remarkable quantum number dependence.
This results in an average value of the ratio Si exp/Si HITRAN 1996=(0.61±0.10).
The self-broadening coefficients show the characteristic quantum number dependence
as already known from other fundamental bands of SO2 (ν1, ν3 bands).
With increasing quantum number Ka′′ the self-broadening coefficients γSO2–SO2
decrease. From a value γSO2–SO2 of about 0.4 cm−1 atm−1 for lines with Ka′′<8
the broadening coefficients decrease down to a value smaller 0.2 cm−1 atm−1
for lines with Ka′′>18. In contrast, no significant tendency in the J′′ dependence
was observed. The experiments for this B-type band confirm that there are no
differences between the quantum number dependencies as well as the absolute
values of the self-broadening coefficients in A-type (ν3, ν1+ν3) and B-type (ν1, ν2)

Abstract = {Sulfur gases are common components in the volcanic and biological
emission on Earth, and are expected to be important input gases for atmospheres
on terrestrial exoplanets. We study the atmospheric composition and the spectra
of terrestrial exoplanets with sulfur compounds (i.e., H2S and SO2) emitted from
their surfaces. We use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model and
radiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheres
ranging from reducing to oxidizing. The most important finding is that both H2S
and SO2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres on
terrestrial exoplanets, based on models of H2, N2, and CO2 atmospheres. This
implies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their
surface emission rates need to be extremely high (>1000 times Earth's volcanic
sulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also find
that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical formation
of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which would condense
to form aerosols if saturated. For terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone
of Sun-like stars or M stars, Earth-like sulfur emission rates result in optically
thick haze composed of elemental sulfur in reducing H2-dominated atmospheres for
a wide range of particle diameters (0.1-1 μm), which is assumed as a free
parameter in our simulations. In oxidized atmospheres composed of N2 and CO2,
optically thick haze, composed of elemental sulfur aerosols (S8) or sulfuric
acid aerosols (H2SO4), will form if the surface sulfur emission is two orders
of magnitude more than the volcanic sulfur emission of Earth. Although direct
detection of H2S and SO2 by their spectral features is unlikely, their emission
might be inferred by observing aerosol-related features in reflected light with
future generation space telescopes.},

(VY CMa). A total of 27 transitions of SO2 and 7 transitions of SO lying in the
energy range 3.0-138.2 cm–1 were analyzed using a new non-LTE radiative transfer
code that incorporates non-spherical geometries. The spectra were primarily
obtained from the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 1 mm spectral survey of VY CMa,
conducted with the Submillimeter Telescope; additional lines were measured with
the ARO 12 m antenna at 2 and 3 mm. SO2 and SO were found to arise from five
distinct outflows within the envelope, four which are asymmetric with respect
to the star. Three flows arise from high-velocity red-shifted material, one from
a blue-shifted wind, and the final from a classic "spherical" expansion. In the
spherical component, the peak fractional abundance, relative to H2, of both
molecules is f ~ 2.5 × 10–7 at r ~ 25 R *, and steadily decreases outward. SO2
appears to be a "parent" molecule, formed near the stellar photosphere.
In the asymmetric outflows, both SO and SO2 are more prominent at large stellar
radii in dense (106-107 cm–3), clumpy material, achieving their maximum abundance
between 200 and 600 R * with f ~ 3.0 × 10–8-1.5 × 10–7. These results suggest
that in the collimated outflows, both species are either produced by shock
chemistry or are remnant inner shell material swept up in the high-velocity winds.},

multiple scenarios of gas distribution and cloud cover. We calculate the observation
time needed to detect explosive volcanism on exoplanets in primary as well as

The instrument (a set of three spectrometers) is capable to sound atmospheric
structure above the clouds in several observation modes (nadir, solar and stellar
occultations) either in the UV or in the near IR spectral ranges. We present
the results from solar occultations in the absorption ranges of SO2 (190–230 nm,
and at 4 μm) and SO (190–230 nm). The dioxide was detected by the SOIR spectrometer
at the altitudes of 65–80 km in the IR and by the SPICAV spectrometer at 85–105
km in the UV. The monoxide’s absorption was measured only by SPICAV at 85–105 km.
We analyzed 39 sessions of solar occultation, where boresights of both spectrometers
are oriented identically, to provide complete vertical profiling of SO2 of the
Venus’ mesosphere (65–105 km). Here we report the first firm detection and measurements
of two SO2 layers. In the lower layer SO2 mixing ratio is within 0.02–0.5 ppmv.

(Sandor, B.J., Todd Clancy, R., Moriarty-Schieven, G., Mills, F.P. [2010].
Icarus 208, 49–60) is characterized by SO2 increasing with the altitude from 0.05
to 2 ppmv, and the [SO2]/[SO] ratio varying from 1 to 5. The presence of
the high-altitude SOx species could be explained by H2SO4 photodissociation
under somewhat warmer temperature conditions in Venus mesosphere. At 90–100 km
the content of the sulfur dioxide correlates with temperature increasing from
0.1 ppmv at 165–170 K to 0.5–1 ppmv at 190–192 K. It supports the hypothesis of
SO2 production by the evaporation of H2SO4 from droplets and its subsequent

Darkening was observed in irradiated SO2 ice and in irradiated S8 pellets.
Photometric and spectral measurements of the thermoluminescence of irradiated SO2

irradiated SO2 ice would not be a dominant contributor to posteclipse brightening
phenomena. After warming to room temperature, a form of SO3 remains along with a
sulfate and S8. Based on these experiments, it is reasonable to propose that small

   a closed photocell using a deuterium lamp (principally 190-235 nm) under
   pressure regimes (5-25 Torr) that produced optically thick conditions
   for (SO2)-S-32 and variable optical depths for other isotopologues. The
   experiments, which were designed to examine the effects of
   intramolecular isotopic substitution of oxygen atoms on the S-MIF
   produced during UV photolysis of SO2, reveal generally reduced sulfur
   fractionation for O-18-rich SO2 as compared to O-16-rich SO2. Model
   shielding calculations were undertaken using spectra that were shifted
   due to changes in rotational and vibrational energy levels. The model
   calculations suggest that processes in addition to rotational and
   vibrational shifts in absorption spectra play a role in the
   experimentally produced isotope effects. Such additional processes may
   include differences in primary photoexcitation arising from smaller
   peak-to-valley amplitudes for fine structure of O-18-rich SO2 absorption
   spectra or an isotopically selective process associated with transitions
   between excited states.},

Journal = JGR,

Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that sulfur played an important role on
   early Mars. Sulfur is distributed ubiquitously on the Martian surface,
   and sulfur in Martian meteorites carries the signature of atmospheric
   interactions. Recent work suggests that the radiative properties of
   sulfur volatiles that were degassed into the Martian atmosphere may have
   caused a greenhouse effect early in the planet's history. It remains
   unclear, however, over what timescales warming from sulfur volatiles
   would have persisted, and consequently how significant this warming may
   have been. While most photochemistry research to date has concentrated
   on current Martian conditions, the ancient Martian atmosphere was
   thicker, warmer, and more reducing than the current regime. Here we
   investigate sulfur photochemistry in a 500 mb ancient Martian
   atmosphere. After adapting a model used to study sulfur photochemistry
   on Earth during the Archean, we find a short lifetime for SO2 in the
   current Martian atmosphere, similar to results of other photochemical
   studies. However, our simulations suggest that moderate mixing ratios of
   SO2 (10(-8) <= f(SO2) <= 10(-6)) could have persisted in the ancient
   Martian atmosphere for hundreds of years, generating short but potent
   warming events following episodes of volcanic activity.},

abstract = {The sulphur compounds SO and SO2 have not been widely studied in
the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. By presenting
and modelling a large number of SO and SO2 lines in the low mass-loss rate M-type
AGB star R Dor, and modelling the available lines of those molecules in a further
four M-type AGB stars, we aim to determine their circumstellar abundances and
distributions. We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated
lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and SO2 line emission and molecular
data files for both SO and SO2 that are more extensive than those previously
available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2 lines to constrain our models for R Dor,
we find an SO abundance of 6.7e−6 and an SO2 abundance of 5e−6 with both species
having high abundances close to the star. We also modelled 34SO and found an
abundance of 3.1e−7, giving an 32SO/34SO ratio of 21.6. We derive similar results
for the circumstellar SO and SO2 abundances and their distributions for the
low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the circumstellar SO and SO2
abundances are much higher than predicted by chemical models and these two
species may account for all available sulphur. For the higher mass-loss rate
stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with peak abundances that decrease
and peak abundance radii that increase with increasing mass-loss rate.
The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very well with the photodissociation
radii of H2O. We find evidence that SO is most likely through the photodissociation
of H2O and the subsequent reaction between S and OH. The S-bearing parent
molecule appears not to be H2S. The SO2 models suggest an origin close to the
star for this species, also disagreeing with current chemical models.},

    rovibrational transitions, the 646 line position and intensity deviation
    patterns are much simpler and more self-consistent than those of the main
    isotopologue 626. The discrepancies are mainly found for higher Ka/J transitions.
    626 and 646 exhibit comparable line position and intensity agreement for
    lower Ka/J transitions. The line position deviations for the 636 purely
    rotational band are parallel to those of 626 and 646, while its line intensity
    deviations do not show branching patterns as we found in the 626 and 646
    cases. Predictions for the other minor isotopologues are expected to exhibit
    similar accuracy. These line lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives
    for missing bands of 626 and the minor isotopologues. It may significantly
    facilitate the laboratory spectroscopic measurement and analysis, as well
    as to identify these isotopologues in various astrophysical environments.},

The band is seen in absorption in UX Cyg, while it is in emission in o Cet.
Seven spectra of T Cep taken at different phases show that the feature changes
from emission to absorption on a time scale of twice the pulsation period. Using
an LTE model, we find that the excitation temperature of SO_2 is typically 600 K,
and that in T Cep the molecule occupies a region with dimensions of several stellar
radii. The total number of molecules contained in this region is of order 10(47),
which requires a local gas density of at least 10(9) H_2 cm(-3) , and possibly up
to 10(11) H_2 cm(-3) depending on the SO_2 abundance. The variation with phase of
the T Cep spectra can be explained by photodissociation of SO_2 molecules by soft UV photons.

Abstract = {We report a new semi-classical method to compute highly excited
   rotational energy levels of an asymmetric-top molecule. The method
   forgoes the idea of a full quantum mechanical treatment of the
   ro-vibrational motion of the molecule. Instead, it employs a
   semi-classical Green's function approach to describe the rotational
   motion, while retaining a quantum mechanical description of the
   vibrations. Similar approaches have existed for some time, but the
   method proposed here has two novel features. First, inspired by the path
   integral method, periodic orbits in the phase space and tunneling paths
   are naturally obtained by means of molecular symmetry analysis. Second,
   the rigorous variational method is employed for the first time to
   describe the molecular vibrations. In addition, we present a new robust
   approach to generating rotational energy surfaces for vibrationally
   excited states; this is done in a fully quantum-mechanical, variational
   manner. The semi-classical approach of the present work is applied to
   calculating the energies of very highly excited rotational states and it
   reduces dramatically the computing time as well as the storage and
   memory requirements when compared to the fullly quantum-mechanical
   variational approach. Test calculations for excited states of SO2 yield
   semi-classical energies in very good agreement with the available
   experimental data and the results of fully quantum-mechanical
