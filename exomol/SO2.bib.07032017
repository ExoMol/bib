Journal = PNAS,

Pages = {17697-17702},
Abstract = {{Signatures of mass-independent isotope fractionation (MIF) are found in
   the oxygen (O-16, O-17, O-18) and sulfur (S-32, S-33, S-34, S-36)
   isotope systems and serve as important tracers of past and present
   atmospheric processes. These unique isotope signatures signify the
   breakdown of the traditional theory of isotope fractionation, but the
   physical chemistry of these isotope effects remains poorly understood.
   We report the production of large sulfur isotope MIF, with Delta S-33 up
   to 78\% and Delta S-36 up to 110\%, from the broadband excitation of SO2
   in the 250-350-nm absorption region. Acetylene is used to selectively
   trap the triplet-state SO2 ((a) over tilde B-3(1)), which results from
   intersystem crossing from the excited singlet ((A) over tilde
   (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) states. The observed MIF signature
   differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific
   absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength
   region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF
   originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states
   but from an isotope selective spin-orbit interaction between the singlet
   ((A) over tilde (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) and triplet ((a) over
   tilde B-3(1)) manifolds. Calculations based on high-level potential
   energy surfaces of the multiple excited states show a considerable
   lifetime anomaly for (SO2)-S-33 and (SO2)-S-36 for the low vibrational
   levels of the (A) over tilde (1)A(2) state. These results demonstrate
   that the isotope selectivity of accidental near-resonance interactions
   between states is of critical importance in understanding the origin of
   MIF in photochemical systems.}},

   submillimeter rotational transitions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfur
   monoxide (SO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were targeted. No active
   release was detected, and we infer 2 sigma upper limits across the disk
   of the planet of 1.1 ppb, 0.7 ppb and 1.3 ppb for SO2, SO and H2S,
   respectively. Our derived upper limit for SO2 is comparable to
   previously reported limits, whereas for H2S we set a more stringent
   upper limit than previously measured, and we establish a limit for SO.
   Among the targeted molecules, SO2 is the strongest indicator for
   volcanic outgassing. Assuming a photochemical lifetime of 2 years for
   SO2, our upper limit of 1.1 ppb implies an outgassing rate less than 55
   metric tons/day. This rate limits the daily amount of degassing magma to
   less than 12,000 m(3). Our sensitivity is sufficient to detect a
   volcanic release on Mars that is 4\% the SO2 released continuously from
   Kilauea volcano in Hawaii or 5\% that of the Masaya volcano in
   Nicaragua. The non-detection of the sulfur compounds in the atmosphere
   of Mars indicates the absence of major volcanic outgassing.}},

Journal =ApJ,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {620},
Pages = {210},
Abstract = {On the basis of observations of the most abundant sulfur-bearing molecules (H2S, CS, NS, SO, H2CS, OCS, and SO2) carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope and the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST), we present the first analysis of the sulfur chemistry of an extragalactic source, the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. This is the first time that H2S and, tentatively, H2CS are detected toward the nucleus of a starburst galaxy. Source-averaged fractional abundances of these molecules are a few times 10-9, except for CS and OCS, which are more abundant (10-8). Sulfur isotopic ratios, 32S/34S ~ 8 ± 2 and 34S/33S > 9, are measured through observations of 13CS, C34S, and C33S. A comparison with the observed relative abundances toward different prototypical Galactic sources suggests that the chemical composition of NGC 253 is similar to that found toward molecular cloud complexes like Sgr B2 in the nuclear region of the Milky Way. The large overabundance of OCS compared with the predictions of time-dependent sulfur chemistry models supports the idea that OCS is likely to have been injected into the gas phase from grain mantles by low-velocity shocks.},

Title = {The chemistry in circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars: Following the origin of the elements to the origin of life},
Journal = PNAS,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {12274},
Abstract = {Mass loss from evolved stars results in the formation of unusual chemical laboratories: circumstellar envelopes. Such envelopes are found around carbon- and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants. As the gaseous material of the envelope flows from the star, the resulting temperature and density gradients create a complex chemical environment involving hot, thermodynamically controlled synthesis, molecule “freeze-out,” shock-initiated reactions, and photochemistry governed by radical mechanisms. In the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich star IRC+10216, >50 different chemical compounds have been identified, including such exotic species as C8H, C3S, SiC3, and AlNC. The chemistry here is dominated by molecules containing long carbon chains, silicon, and metals such as magnesium, sodium, and aluminum, which makes it quite distinct from that found in molecular clouds. The molecular composition of the oxygen-rich counterparts is not nearly as well explored, although recent studies of VY Canis Majoris have resulted in the identification of HCO+, SO2, and even NaCl in this object, suggesting chemical complexity here as well. As these envelopes evolve into planetary nebulae with a hot, exposed central star, synthesis of molecular ions becomes important, as indicated by studies of NGC 7027. Numerous species such as HCO+, HCN, and CCH are found in old planetary nebulae such as the Helix. This “survivor” molecular material may be linked to the variety of compounds found recently in diffuse clouds. Organic molecules in dense interstellar clouds may ultimately be traced back to carbon-rich fragments originally formed in circumstellar shells. },

Title = {Sulfur chemistry in the envelopes of massive young stars},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2003},
Volume = {412},
Pages = {133},
Abstract = {The sulphur chemistry in nine regions in the earliest stages of high-mass star formation is studied through single-dish submillimeter spectroscopy. The line profiles indicate that 10-50% of the SO and SO 2 emission arises in high-velocity gas, either infalling or outflowing. For the low-velocity gas, excitation temperatures are 25 K for H 2S, 50 K for SO, H 2CS, NS and HCS +, and 100 K for OCS and SO 2, indicating that most observed emission traces the outer parts ( T<100 K) of the molecular envelopes, except high-excitation OCS and SO 2 lines. Abundances in the outer envelopes, calculated with a Monte Carlo program, using the physical structures of the sources derived from previous submillimeter continuum and CS line data, are ~10 -8 for OCS, ~10 -9 for H 2S, H 2CS, SO and SO 2, and ~10 -10 for HCS + and NS. In the inner envelopes ( T>100 K) of six sources, the SO 2 abundance is enhanced by a factor of ~100-1000. This region of hot, abundant SO 2 has been seen before in infrared absorption, and must be small, $\la$0 $\farcs$2 (180 AU radius). The derived abundance profiles are consistent with models of envelope chemistry which invoke ice evaporation at $T\sim 100$  K. Shock chemistry is unlikely to contribute. A major sulphur carrier in the ices is probably OCS, not H 2S as most models assume. The source-to-source abundance variations of most molecules by factors of ~10 do not correlate with previous systematic tracers of envelope heating. Without observations of H 2S and SO lines probing warm ( $\ga$100 K) gas, sulphur-bearing molecules cannot be used as evolutionary tracers during star formation.},

Abstract = {The total atomization energies, geometries, and anharmonic force fields of the SO and SO2 molecules have been studied at the augmented coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] level near the one-particle basis set limit. The effect of core correlation has been accounted for. The addition of high-exponent d and f "inner polarization functions" to the sulfur basis set was found to be essential for obtaining reliable molecular geometries. The differential effect of core correlation on computed properties is in fact much less important. The CCSD(T) one-particle basis set limit for the symmetric stretching frequencies appears to be higher than the exact value, while the antisymmetric stretching frequency benefits from an error cancellation. The basis set extension effects of diffuse functions and inner polarization functions appear to be nearly perfectly additive. Our best computed atomization energies and geometries agree to within 0.1 kcal/mol, 0.0004 Angstrom, and 0.03 degrees with experiment: The errors in the fundamentals of SO2 are +3.9, -0.4, and +0.4 cm(-1). The best computed quartic force field for SO2 should provide a good starting point for a new experimental refinement. },

Abstract = {{SO2 is an important constituent of the atmospheres of Io and Venus.
   Accurate photoabsorption cross-section data at the temperatures of these
   planetary atmospheres are required for the interpretation of SO2
   observations and for reliable photochemical models. As part of a planned
   series of measurements over the 160-300 K range, photoabsorption cross
   sections of SO2 at 295 K, in the wavelength region 198-220 nm, have been
   determined from very high resolution (resolving power (lambda/Delta
   lambda) approximate to 450,000) absorption spectra recorded with a
   vacuum ultraviolet Fourier transform spectrometer. These new
   measurements are compared with earlier, lower-resolution (lambda/Delta
   lambda approximate to 100,000) photoabsorption measurements at 213 K
   spanning the same wavelength region, with lower-resolution (lambda/Delta
   lambda approximate to 100,000) measurements at 295 K in a more limited
   region, and with a recent Doppler-limited laser diode measurement at 295
   K over a very narrow wavelength region.}},

Abstract = {{The ultraviolet absorption cross sections of the SO2 isotopologues are
   essential to understanding the photochemical fractionation of sulfur
   isotopes in planetary atmospheres. We present measurements of the
   absorption cross sections of (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, (SO2)-S-34, and
   (SO2)-S-36, recorded from 190 to 220nm at room temperature with a
   resolution of 0.1nm (25cm(-1)) made using a dual-beam photospectrometer.
   The measured absorption cross sections show an apparent pressure
   dependence and a newly developed analytical model shows that this is
   caused by underresolved fine structure. The model made possible the
   calculation of absorption cross sections at the zero-pressure limit that
   can be used to calculate photolysis rates for atmospheric scenarios. The
   (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, and (SO2)-S-34 cross sections improve upon
   previously published spectra including fine structure and peak widths.
   This is the first report of absolute absorption cross sections of the
   (SO2)-S-36 isotopologue for the (CB2)-B-1-X(1)A(2) band where the
   amplitude of the vibrational structure is smaller than the other
   isotopologues throughout the spectrum. Based on the new results, solar
   UV photodissociation of SO2 produces (34)epsilon, (33), and (36)
   isotopic fractionations of +4.611.6, +8.89.0, and -8.8 +/- 19.6 parts
   per thousand, respectively. From these spectra isotopic effects during
   photolysis in the Archean atmosphere can be calculated and compared to
   the Archean sedimentary record. Our results suggest that broadband solar
   UV photolysis is capable of producing the mass-independent fractionation
   observed in the Archean sedimentary record without involving shielding
   by specific gaseous compounds in the atmosphere including SO2 itself.
   The estimated magnitude of (33), for example, is close to the maximum
   S-33 observed in the geological record.}},

Abstract = {{We report measurements of the ultraviolet absorption cross-sections of
   (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33, (SO2)-S-34 and (SO2)-S-36 recorded from 250 to
   320 nm at 293 K with a resolution of 8 cm(-1). This is the first
   reported measurement of the (SO2)-S-36 cross-section. This work improves
   earlier measurements of the (SO2)-S-32, (SO2)-S-33 and (SO2)-S-34
   cross-sections and is in good agreement concerning fine structure and
   peak widths, with localized differences at the peak maxima when isotope
   effects are taken into account. SO2 samples were produced in an
   identical process via combustion of isotopically enriched S-0,
   eliminating effects due to variation in oxygen isotopic composition.
   Peak positions for the rare isotopologues are red shifted relative to
   the (SO2)-S-32 isotopologue. Starting at the origin the shift increases
   linearly through the band. A linear shift model based on the spectrum of
   (SO2)-S-32 was used to estimate the cross-sections of (SO2)-S-33,34,36;
   the average of the wavelength resolved absolute difference between the
   modeled and experimental spectra is 77.4, 107 and 139 parts per thousand
   respectively. While the peak-to-valley amplitude of (SO2)-S-36 tends to
   be smaller than the other isotopologues throughout the spectrum,
   integrated band intensities for all isotopologues are conserved to
   within 4\% relative to (SO2)-S-32. The cross-sections were used in a
   photochemical model to obtain fractionation constants to compare with
   photochemical chamber experiments. We conclude that planetary
   atmospheres will exhibit isotopic fractionation from both

   Numerous wave packet simulations were carried out under the adiabatic

All low-lying rovibrational energy levels—both permutation-symmetry-allowed and not allowed—are computed, for all values of total angular momentum in the range J = 0-20. The calculations have carried out using the ScalIT suite of parallel codes. The present study (Paper II) examines the J = 11-20 rovibrational levels, providing symmetry and rovibrational labels for every computed state, relying on a new lambda-doublet splitting technique to make completely unambiguous assignments. Isotope shifts are analyzed, as is the validity of “J-shifting” as a predictor of rotational fine structure. Among other ramifications, this work will facilitate understanding of mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotopes (S-MIF) observed in the Archean rock record—particularly as this may have arisen from self shielding. S-MIF, in turn is highly relevant in the broader context of understanding the “oxygen revolution”. "

Volume = {778},
Pages = {22},
Abstract = {{Detailed radiative transfer modeling has been carried out for SO2 and SO originating in the envelope of the O-rich supergiant star VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa). A total of 27 transitions of SO2 and 7 transitions of SO lying in the energy range 3.0-138.2 cm–1 were analyzed using a new non-LTE radiative transfer code that incorporates non-spherical geometries. The spectra were primarily obtained from the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 1 mm spectral survey of VY CMa, conducted with the Submillimeter Telescope; additional lines were measured with the ARO 12 m antenna at 2 and 3 mm. SO2 and SO were found to arise from five distinct outflows within the envelope, four which are asymmetric with respect to the star. Three flows arise from high-velocity red-shifted material, one from a blue-shifted wind, and the final from a classic "spherical" expansion. In the spherical component, the peak fractional abundance, relative to H2, of both molecules is f ~ 2.5 × 10–7 at r ~ 25 R *, and steadily decreases outward. SO2 appears to be a "parent" molecule, formed near the stellar photosphere. In the asymmetric outflows, both SO and SO2 are more prominent at large stellar radii in dense (106-107 cm–3), clumpy material, achieving their maximum abundance between 200 and 600 R * with f ~ 3.0 × 10–8-1.5 × 10–7. These results suggest that in the collimated outflows, both species are either produced by shock chemistry or are remnant inner shell material swept up in the high-velocity winds.}},

I report here the results of chemical kinetics modeling of self-shielding during photodissociation of \{SO2\} in the C ˜ 1 B 2 − X ˜ 1 A 1 bands from 190 to 220 nm. This band system is dominated by a bending mode progression that produces shifts in the absorption spectrum upon sulfur isotope substitution. Self-shielding in the rotationally-resolved lines of 32SO2 produces \{MIF\} signatures in \{SO\} and residual SO2. Using approximate synthetic spectra for the sulfur isotopologues of SO2, I show that \{SO2\} photolysis yields a sulfur \{MIF\} signature that can account for much of the laboratory \{MIF\} measured, and is in qualitative agreement with Δ 33 S and Δ 36 S values observed in Archean rocks.

   a closed photocell using a deuterium lamp (principally 190-235 nm) under
   pressure regimes (5-25 Torr) that produced optically thick conditions
   for (SO2)-S-32 and variable optical depths for other isotopologues. The
   experiments, which were designed to examine the effects of
   intramolecular isotopic substitution of oxygen atoms on the S-MIF
   produced during UV photolysis of SO2, reveal generally reduced sulfur
   fractionation for O-18-rich SO2 as compared to O-16-rich SO2. Model
   shielding calculations were undertaken using spectra that were shifted
   due to changes in rotational and vibrational energy levels. The model
   calculations suggest that processes in addition to rotational and
   vibrational shifts in absorption spectra play a role in the
   experimentally produced isotope effects. Such additional processes may
   include differences in primary photoexcitation arising from smaller

Journal = JGR,
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{114}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that sulfur played an important role on
   early Mars. Sulfur is distributed ubiquitously on the Martian surface,
   and sulfur in Martian meteorites carries the signature of atmospheric
   interactions. Recent work suggests that the radiative properties of
   sulfur volatiles that were degassed into the Martian atmosphere may have
   caused a greenhouse effect early in the planet's history. It remains
   unclear, however, over what timescales warming from sulfur volatiles
   would have persisted, and consequently how significant this warming may
   have been. While most photochemistry research to date has concentrated
   on current Martian conditions, the ancient Martian atmosphere was
   thicker, warmer, and more reducing than the current regime. Here we
   investigate sulfur photochemistry in a 500 mb ancient Martian
   atmosphere. After adapting a model used to study sulfur photochemistry
   on Earth during the Archean, we find a short lifetime for SO2 in the
   current Martian atmosphere, similar to results of other photochemical
   studies. However, our simulations suggest that moderate mixing ratios of
   SO2 (10(-8) <= f(SO2) <= 10(-6)) could have persisted in the ancient
   Martian atmosphere for hundreds of years, generating short but potent
   warming events following episodes of volcanic activity.}},

We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis based on the accelerated lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and SO2 line emission and molecular data files for both SO and SO2 that are more extensive than those previously available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2 lines to constrain our models for R Dor, we find an SO abundance of 6.7e−6 and an SO2 abundance of 5e−6 with both species having high abundances close to the star. We also modelled 34SO and found an abundance of 3.1e−7, giving an 32SO/34SO ratio of 21.6. We derive similar results for the circumstellar SO and SO2 abundances and their distributions for the low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the circumstellar SO and SO2 abundances are much higher than predicted by chemical models and these two species may account for all available sulphur. For the higher mass-loss rate stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with peak abundances that decrease and peak abundance radii that increase with increasing mass-loss rate. The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very well with the photodissociation radii of H2O. We find evidence that SO is most likely through the photodissociation of H2O and the subsequent reaction between S and OH. The S-bearing parent molecule appears not to be H2S. The SO2 models suggest an origin close to the star for this species, also disagreeing with current chemical models.}},
