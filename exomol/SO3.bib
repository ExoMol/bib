Title = {{Measurement techniques for sulfur trioxide concentration in coal-fired
   flue gas: a review}},
Journal= {Environ. Sci. Pollut. Res.},
Abstract = {{Under the extensive implementation of ultra-low emission facilities,
   sulfur trioxide (SO3) has received increasing attention. This article
   reviews the measurement techniques for SO3 in flue gas, which include
   controlled condensation method (CCM), isopropanol absorption method
   (IPA), salt method, tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS),
   ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UVs), and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The first three methods are chemical
   methods, which focus on the extraction of SO3 from flue gas. With highly
   reactive nature and relatively low concentrations, which are about 5
   mg/m(3) even lower, achieving high-fidelity flue gas sampling and
   non-destructive extraction of SO3 is the key to SO3 measurement. The
   latter three methods belong to spectroscopic methods, which focus on the
   principle, system composition, and influencing factor analysis. With
   real-time response and 1-ppm detection limit, attention is attracted to
   spectroscopic methods on online measurement. This article
   comprehensively introduces the measurement techniques for SO3
   concentration in flue gas and presents conclusions so as to enable
   researchers to decide the direction of further investigation.}},

journal= {Environ. Sci. Pollut. Res.},
year= {2019},
abstract= {Under the extensive implementation of ultra-low emission (ULE) facilities in coal-fired power plants of China, sulfur trioxide (SO3) has received increasing attention due to its impact on human health and operation safety of power plants. However, systematic research and evaluation for controlling SO3 emission in various ULE facilities are still lacking. Here, a systematic study was conducted based on 378 in situ performance evaluation tests carried out in 148 coal-fired power plants. The results illustrate that the SO2/SO3 conversion rate of the selective catalytic reduction devices can be controlled within 1{\%} before and after ULE retrofit. Also, the synergistic removal efficiency of SO3 in the low-low-temperature electrostatic precipitator and the wet electrostatic precipitator can be higher than 70{\%}. The removal efficiency of SO3 in the wet limestone-gypsum flue gas desulfurization scrubber is 33--64{\%} before ULE and 31--81{\%} after, and the average efficiency of the double scrubbers is 8.7{\%} higher than that of the single scrubber. Due to the different SO3 removing abilities of various technologies, the overall efficiency of SO3 removal is in the range between 27 and 95{\%} adopting different ULE technical routes. Average concentration of SO3 emission can be decreased by 51.8{\%} after ULE application.},

Title = {Evaluation of SO3 Measurement Techniques in Air and Oxy-Fuel Combustion},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {5537-5549},
Abstract = {SO2 is enriched in wry-fuel combustion due to flue-gas recycle, and a
   significant higher SO3 concentration can be expected compared to
   air-firing. Since SO3 can cause high and low temperature corrosion, it
   is important to measure the SO3 concentration under oxy-fuel fired
   conditions. However, measurement of SO3 is not straightforward, since
   SO3 is a highly reactive gas. This paper presents an experimental study
   in the Chalmers oxy-fuel test unit, comparing different SO3 measurement
   techniques applied during oxy-fuel and air combustion. Propane (60
   kW(th)) was used as fuel and SO2 was injected in the oxidizer to
   generate a controllable amount of SO3. The SO3 concentration was
   measured with four techniques: the controlled condensation method, the
   salt method, the isopropanol absorption bottle method, and with the
   Pentol SO3 monitor (previously: Severn Science analyzer). The controlled
   condensation method was used as the standard for comparison.
   Additionally, the acid dew-point temperature was measured with a
   dew-point meter. The controlled condensation and the salt method gave
   comparable results, and the repeatability with these methods was good.
   The SO3 concentrations measured with the Pentol SO3 monitor differed in
   average less than 20\% from the SO3 concentrations obtained with the
   controlled condensation method. With the isopropanol absorption bottle
   method, a large amount of the SO2 was absorbed in the isopropanol
   solution, which gives a positive bias if the SO2 is oxidized to sulfate
   in the isopropanol solution. This was minimized by reducing the
   measurement time, bubbling argon through the absorption bottles after
   the measurement to force the SO2 out, and analyzing the solution
   immediately after the measurement. No principal differences between
   measuring the SO3 concentration during oxy-fuel combustion and
   air-firing were obtained. However, a correction factor for the mass flow
   meter of the Pentol SO3 monitor has to be used because of the high CO,
   concentration during oxy-fuel operation.},

   mesosphere of Venus}},
Journal = {Nat. Geosci.}
Year = {2010},
volume = {3},
Pages = {834-837},
Abstract = {The sulphur cycle plays fundamental roles in the chemistry(1-3) and
   climate(4,5) of Venus. Thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry at the
   surface of Venus favours the production of carbonyl sulphide(6) and to a
   lesser extent sulphur dioxide. These gases are transported to the middle
   atmosphere by the Hadley circulation cell(7,8). Above the cloud top, a
   sulphur oxidation cycle involves conversion of carbonyl sulphide into
   sulphur dioxide, which is then transported further upwards. A
   significant fraction of this sulphur dioxide is subsequently oxidized to
   sulphur trioxide and eventually reacts with water to form sulphuric
   acid(3). Because the vapour pressure of sulphuric acid is low, it
   readily condenses and forms an upper cloud layer at altitudes of 60-70
   km, and an upper haze layer above 70 km (ref. 9), which effectively
   sequesters sulphur oxides from photochemical reactions. Here we present
   simulations of the fate of sulphuric acid in the Venusian mesosphere
   based on the Caltech/JPL kinetics model(3,10), but including the
   photolysis of sulphuric acid. Our model suggests that the mixing ratios
   of sulphur oxides are at least five times higher above 90 km when the
   photolysis of sulphuric acid is included. Our results are inconsistent
   with the previous model results but in agreement with the recent
   observations using ground-based microwave spectroscopy(11) and by Venus
   Express(12).},

Abstract = {Volcanic fog (vog)from Kilauea volcano on the island of Hawaii includes
   a variety of chemical species including sulfur compounds and traces of
   metals such as mercury. The metal species seen tended to be in the
   nanograms per cubic meter range, whereas oxides of sulfur: SO2 and SO3
   and sulfate aerosols, were in the range of micrograms per cubic meter
   and rarely even as high as a few milligrams per cubic meter of air
   (nominally ppb to ppm). These sulfur species are being investigated for
   associations with both acute and chronic changes in human health status.
   The sulfate aerosols tend to be less than 1 mu m in diameter and tend to
   dominate the mass of this submicron size mode. The sulfur chemistry is
   dynamic, changing composition from predominantly sulfur dioxide and
   trioxide gasses near the volcano, to predominantly sulfate aerosols on
   the west side of the island. Time, concentration and composition
   characteristics of submicron aerosols and sulfur dioxide are described
   with respect to the related on-going health studies and public health
   management concerns. Exposures to sulfur dioxide and particulate matter
   equal to or less than 1 mu m in size were almost always below the
   national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). These standards do not
   however consider the acidic nature and submicron size of the aerosol,
   nor the possibility of the aerosol and the sulfur dioxide interacting in
   their toxicity. Time series plots, histograms and descriptive statistics
   of hourly averages give the reader a sense of some of the exposures
   observed.},
