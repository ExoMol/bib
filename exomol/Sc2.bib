Abstract = {Global potential curves have been obtained for the ground state and
   low-lying states of the Sc dimer with state averaged complete active
   space self-consistent field and multireference configuration interaction
   calculations. The obtained curves are smooth over a wide range of
   internuclear distances. The calculated spectroscopic constants of the
   ground state agree well with experiment. The configurations arising from
   the F-4 + F-4 atomic limit become predominant in the bonding region for
   the second and third states. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},
