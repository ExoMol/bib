abstract = {The theoretical study of the electronic structure of Scandium Hydride ScH has been carried out using ab-initio methods. By employing (MRCI-SD/SA-CASSCF) and by using basis sets involving contribution of all electrons of both Scandium and Hydrogen atoms, 18 singlet and 15 triplet low-lying electronic states have been calculated below 28803 cm−1. Potential energy curves have been plotted and the term values at equilibrium Te, the vibrational constants ωe and ωeχe of ScH electronic states have been fitted. In addition, we calculated the permanent electric dipole moments for all these predicted states, the transition dipole moments TDMs within states at a range of internuclear distance around the equilibrium, the vibronic intensities FCF and the radiative lifetime. The calculated spectroscopic constants are in excellent consistency with the available experimental results and with other previous theoretical works. These calculations also predicted many excited states unobserved experimentally. The observed perturbations in D1Π and C1Σ+ have been investigated in this work.}

	core potential (ECP) and all-electron (AE) approaches. The two approaches
	are based on the multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF)
	method, followed by second-order configuration interaction (SOCI)
	calculations: the first method employs an ECP basis set proposed
	by Stevens and co-workers (SBKJC) augmented by a set of polarization
	functions, and spin-orbit coupling effects are estimated with a one-electron
	approximation, using effective nuclear charges. The second method
	employs a double-zeta basis set developed by Huzinaga (MIDI) and
	three sets of p functions are added to both transition element and
	hydrogen and one set of f functions is also added to the transition
	element. The relativistic elimination of small components (RESC)
	scheme and full Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian are employed in the AE approaches
	to incorporate relativistic effects. The present paper reports a
	comprehensive set of theoretical results including the dissociation
	energies, equilibrium distances, electronic transition energies,
	harmonic frequencies, anharmonicities, and rotational constants for
	several low-lying spin-mixed states in the hydrides, filling a considerable

abstract ={Diatomic hydride and deuteride spectra of all the second row transition
   metals have been studied in absorption between 290 and 700 nm behind reflected shock waves.
   The first known spectra of ScH, ScD, VH, and VD have been identified, together with new
   spectra due to CoH, CoD, NiH, and NiD. Some new bands of CoD and NiD are analysed, and it
   is shown that an electronic isotope shift exists in NiD. The effect of such a shift
   on the determination of vibrational constants is discussed.},
