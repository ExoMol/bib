   abstract = {The electronic structure of six low-lying electronic states of scandium hydride, X (1)sigma(+), a (3)Delta, b (3)pi, A (1)Delta, c (3)sigma(+) and B (1)pi, is studied using multi-reference configuration interaction as a function of bond length. Diagonal and off-diagonal dipole moment, spin-orbit coupling and electronic angular momentum curves are also computed. The results are benchmarked against experimental measurements and calculations on atomic scandium. The resulting curves are used to compute a line list of molecular rovibronic transitions for (ScH)-Sc-45.},
