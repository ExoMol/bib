   abstract = {The electric dipole moment of the A2Π state (v = 1) of ScO is
   determined to be 4.13 ± 0.21 D in and 4.25 ± 0.25 D (2σ uncertainties) in by
   laser induced fluorescence excitation spectroscopy of the (1) and (1) (G = 3
   or 4 where G  I + S) lines in the presence of a large homogeneous electric
   field. The positions of low-J lines in the A2Π - X2Σ+ (1,0) band are also reported.},
