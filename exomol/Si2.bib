abstract = {Electronic absorption spectra of silicon molecules Sin and Sin- (n =
2-4) in 5 K neon matrices have been observed. The approach is based on
mass-selection and codeposition with neon. The neutral species become
apparent after photodetachment. The band systems detected are assigned
using available calculations and photoelectron spectra. In the case of
Si3 (C2v), electronic transitions from the X 1A1 ground state to the
excited electronic states 1B1, 1A1, 1B1, and 1B2 have been identified.
Their bands are at 778.9, 579.7, 522.3, and 388.3 nm, respectively.
Two band systems, with origin bands at 925.3 and 466.6 nm, are
assigned to the 1B3u {$leftarrow$} X 1Ag and 1B1u {$leftarrow$} X 1Ag
transitions of Si4 (D2h). Two known electronic transitions are
obtained for Si2, but a reported band system with origin at 288.3 nm
cannot be due to this molecule. The following electronic transitions
were detected for the anions:, Si2-, 2{$Pi$}u {$leftarrow$} X Si3-
(C2v), 2A1 {$leftarrow$} X 2A1; Si4- (D2h), 2B1u {$leftarrow$} X 2B2g,
with origin bands at 432.7, 1036.7, and 872.6 nm. Vibrational
frequencies of several totally symmetric modes could be inferred for
the studied species in the electronic excited states.},

@article{80BrPeBu.Si2,
abstract = {Large-scale CI calculations are reported for the potential curves of
the isovalent series of diatomic systems CN+, Si2, SiC, CP+, and SiN+
in their lowest electronic states. The standard AO basis sets employed
are of double zeta plus polarization quality and the CI method used is
of the multireference double-excitation (MRD-CI) variety including
individualized configuration selection and energy extrapolation. By
including up to 17 reference species to generate the MRD-CI spaces (of
orders up to 150000) and by supplementing the AO basis with f
functions it is found that the ground state of CN+ is the {$pi$}4
1{$sum$} + species (as in isovalent C2) falling 0.1 eV below the
{$sigmapi$}3 3{$Pi$} state. This result is in significant disagreement
with earlier theoretical predictions on this point, which have
generally tended to place the 3{$Pi$} state at least 0.3 eV below
1{$sum$}+. The importance of using more than a single reference
configuration in the CI calculations is underscored in this example.
For Si2 a similar nearly isoenergetic relationship is noted for its
lowest two electronic states, but in this case the competing states
are 3{$Pi$}u and 3{$sum$}g- with 1{$sum$}g+ found to lie 0.7 eV higher
in this spectrum. The mixed first- and second-row systems SiC and CP+
both show a clear 3{$Pi$} ground state, well separated from both
1{$sum$}+ and 3{$sum$}-, but in SiN + the absolute energy minimum is
found to occur for 3{$sum$}-, whereby the wide variations in the
relative stabilities of all these states from one system to another is
seen to be a consequence of the weakening of {$pi$} bonding relative
to {$sigma$} as second-row atomic character is introduced into these
molecules. Finally generally good agreement is observed between
calculation and experiment in this study, with errors of 0.02 bohr and
70 cm-1 being indicated for known bond lengths and stretching
frequencies. textcopyright{} 1980 American Institute of Physics.},
