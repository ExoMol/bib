Title = {Theoretical studies on the SiC radical: electronic structure,
   spectroscopy and spin-orbit couplings},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {66},
Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of twenty-five Lambda-S states and
   twenty Omega states generated from eight Lambda-S states of the SiC
   radical are calculated by using an ab initio quantum chemical method.
   The PEC calculations are performed for internuclear separations from
   0.10 to 1.00 nm using the complete active space self-consistent field
   method, which is followed by the internally contracted multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) approach in combination with a
   correlation-consistent aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. To improve the quality of
   the PECs, core-valence correlation and relativistic corrections are
   included. Core-valence correlations are included using a cc-pCVTZ basis
   set. Relativistic corrections are calculated using the third-order
   Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of cc-pV5Z basis
   set. The spin-orbit coupling effect is accounted for by the Breit-Pauli
   Hamiltonian in combination with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. To obtain
   more reliable results, the PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are
   corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson
   modification. The PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS)
   limit by the total-energy extrapolation scheme. The spectroscopic
   parameters are obtained by fitting the vibrational levels, which are
   calculated by solving the ro-vibrational Schrodinger equation using the
   Numerov's method. The spectroscopic results are compared with those
   reported in the literature. Excellent agreement has been found between
   the present results and the measurements. The vibrational manifolds of
   the first 30 vibrational states are calculated for each electronic state
   of the non-rotating radical. Comparison with the measurements
   demonstrates that the present results are accurate. The spectroscopic
   parameters and the molecular constants reported here are expected to be
   reliable predicted results.},

Title = {{Transition probabilities between the X-3 Pi, A(3)Sigma(-), B-3 Sigma(+),
   C-3 Pi, D-3 Delta, and E-3 Pi states of SiC molecules}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we calculated the potential energy curves of the X-3 Pi,
   A(3)Sigma(-), B-3 Sigma(+), C-3 Pi, D-3 Delta, and E-3 Pi states of SiC
   molecules and the transition probabilities between them. The
   rotationless radiative lifetimes of the vibrational levels are in the
   order of 10(-5) s for the A(3)Sigma(-) state, 10(-5)-10(-6) s for the
   B-3 Sigma(+) state, and 10(-6) to 10(-7) s for the C-3 Pi and E-3 Pi
   states. This suggests that the spontaneous emissions originating from
   these states can easily occur. The rotationless radiative lifetimes vary
   in the range of 10(-3)-10(-5) s for the vibrational levels of the D-3
   Delta state. The lifetime of the D-3 Delta, state rapidly decreases with
   the increasing vibrational level, indicating that the occurrence of
   spontaneous emissions originating from this state at lower levels is
   more inhibited than those at higher levels. The emissions of the
   A(3)Sigma(-)-X-3 Pi, B-3 Sigma(+)-X-3 Pi, C-3 Pi-X-3 Pi, C-3
   Pi-A(3)Sigma(-), D-3 Delta-X-3 Pi, and E-3 Pi-X-3 Pi system are strong,
   suggesting that these transitions can be measured easily by
   spectroscopy. The emissions of the D-3 Delta-C-3 Pi and E-3 Pi-D-3 Delta
   systems are weak, suggesting that these transitions are difficult to
   detect by spectroscopy. The spectral range of the strong emissions from
   the A(3)Sigma(-)-X-3 Pi system is in the infrared region. The strong
   emissions of the B-3 Sigma(+)-X-3 Pi, C-3 Pi-X-3 Pi, and C-3
   Pi-A(3)Sigma(-) systems are of visible light. Some of these strong
   emissions, especially those from the A(3)Sigma(-)-X-3 Pi system, could
   be expected to be detectable in carbon star IRC + 10,126 and the
   circumstellar shell. }},
