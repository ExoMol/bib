abstract = {In recent years, emissions of silicon carbide molecule have been
widely detected in carbon stars, stellar atmospheres, and interstellar
molecular clouds. In order to evaluate the vibronic transitions
between different singlet states of this molecule, we calculate the
potential energy curves of the a(1) Sigma(+), b(1)Pi, c(1) Delta, d(1)
Sigma(+), e(1) Sigma(-), and f(1) Pi states and compute the transition
dipole moments between them. The band origins, Einstein A
coefficients, and Franck-Condon factors of the vibronic emissions are
computed for all possible transitions between these six lowest-lying
states. Of these vibronic transitions, only the emissions of the d(1)
Sigma(+)-b(1)Pi and f(1) Pi-b(1)Pi systems are strong. The emissions
of the f(1)Pi-a(1) Sigma(+) system are so weak that it is very
difficult to measure them through spectroscopy. The rotationless
radiative lifetimes are approximately several microseconds for all
vibrational levels of the d(1) Sigma(+) and f(1) Pi states, indicating
that the vibronic emissions originating from the two states occur
easily. The rotationless radiative lifetimes are approximately several
ms for all vibrational levels of the e(1) Sigma(-) state. Based on the
Einstein A coefficients, we conclude that it is difficult to measure
these emissions generated from the e(1) Sigma(-) state, regardless of
the radiative lifetime. The rotationless radiative lifetimes are of
the order of 10(-3)-10(-4)s for all vibrational levels of the b(1) Pi
and c(1) Delta states. The transition probabilities reported in this
study can be employed to explain why the emissions between the singlet
states of this molecule have rarely been measured to date, both in a
spectroscopy experiment and in outer space. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

using the Complete Active Space Self Consistent Field (CASSCF) with

methane. Subsequently, they are irradiated with tunable IR light from
an IR free electron laser before they are ionized with UV photons from

an enhanced ionization efficiency for SimCn and provides the size-
specific IR spectra. IR spectra measured for Si-6, Si5C, and Si4C2 are
assigned to their most stable isomers by comparison with calculated
linear absorption spectra. The preferred SimCn structures with m + n =

been performed. The systems chosen are the small semiconductor binary
SimCn nanoclusters mainly having m + n {$<$}= 5 and the results are
the various physical properties i.e., the stability, structural,
electronic, vibrational, optical and Raman scattering properties. The
localized basis set employed consists of the contracted Gaussian
orbitals in the B3LYP-DFT method and the chosen method using the
plane-wave set is the usual pseudopotential method in generalized
gradient approximation. The time-dependent density functional theory
is employed for predicting the optical properties for the
nanoclusters. The results predicted by both the above formalisms are
quite similar e.g., the most stable structures but are marginally
different for some properties. The binding energies obtained in the
B3LYP-DFT method are approximately 5% smaller as compared to those in
the pseudopotential method. In the case of the SiC cluster, the
reported experimental value of 2.30 eV is very close to the
pseudopotential value of 2.35 eV but far from the B3LYP-DFT value of
2.12 eV. The vibrational frequencies obtained in the pseudopotential
method are in better agreement with the experimental data as compared
to those calculated in the B3LYP-DFT method. The behaviour seen
earlier in the isolated C and Si nanoclusters is preserved in the SiC
nanoclusters. In the most stable configurations, the structures
containing the carbon atoms in majority are linear chains whereas the
clusters having silicon atoms in majority are either planar or three-
dimensional ones. In Si2C formula, both the linear and triangular
configurations are equally stable. The results for the various
physical properties for the various structures are seen to be in
agreement with the available experimental data. Also, a number of new
cluster configurations have been predicted which are highly stable but
not reported in the literature. The growth of these most stable
structures should be possible in the experiments.},

abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of twenty-five Lambda-S states and
twenty Omega states generated from eight Lambda-S states of the SiC
radical are calculated by using an ab initio quantum chemical method.
The PEC calculations are performed for internuclear separations from
0.10 to 1.00 nm using the complete active space self-consistent field
method, which is followed by the internally contracted multireference
configuration interaction (MRCI) approach in combination with a
correlation-consistent aug-cc-pV6Z basis set. To improve the quality
of the PECs, core-valence correlation and relativistic corrections are
included. Core-valence correlations are included using a cc-pCVTZ
basis set. Relativistic corrections are calculated using the third-
order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of cc-pV5Z
basis set. The spin-orbit coupling effect is accounted for by the
Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian in combination with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.
To obtain more reliable results, the PECs determined by the MRCI
calculations are corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the
Davidson modification. The PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis
set (CBS) limit by the total-energy extrapolation scheme. The
spectroscopic parameters are obtained by fitting the vibrational
levels, which are calculated by solving the ro-vibrational Schrodinger
equation using the Numerov's method. The spectroscopic results are
compared with those reported in the literature. Excellent agreement
has been found between the present results and the measurements. The
vibrational manifolds of the first 30 vibrational states are
calculated for each electronic state of the non-rotating radical.
Comparison with the measurements demonstrates that the present results
are accurate. The spectroscopic parameters and the molecular constants
reported here are expected to be reliable predicted results.},

3068, the only carbon star previously known to show the 11-mu m
silicon carbide (SiC) feature in absorption, we have discovered three
further examples of sources that show SiC in net absorption, namely
IRAS 02408 + 5458, AFGL 2477 and AFGL 5625. We investigate the
mineralogy of carbon star SiC and its relationship to meteoritic dust
by using a chi(2)-minimization routine to fit the observed SiC
features, and laboratory optical constants that have been published
for a variety of SiC samples. With the exception of R For, all of the
observed SiC features are best fitted by alpha-SiC grains, Excluding
V414 Per, all of the sources with 8-13 mu m colour temperatures
{$>$}1200K (corresponding to mass-loss rates at the bottom end of the
range) are best fitted by alpha-SiC in pure emission, whereas all but
one of the sources with 8-13 mu m colour temperatures {$<$} 1200 K
(corresponding to higher mass-loss rates) are best fitted using self-
absorbed alpha-SiC emission, The four sources whose SiC features are
in net absorption (and which have the lowest 8-13 mu m colour
temperatures and therefore presumably the highest mass-loss rates) are
also well fitted by self-absorbed alpha-SiC emission, but with higher
optical depths. Given that beta-SiC is the form most commonly found in
meteorites, we have searched for evidence of beta-SiC in the
circumstellar shells of all these carbon stars. However, our
observations provide no unambiguous evidence for the presence of beta-
SiC around these stars, with all of the observed SiC features being
best explained in terms of alpha-SiC grains, The self-absorption that
we find in the observed SiC emission features has not previously been
taken into account in radiative transfer modelling, and so the amount
of SIC present in the outflows has probably been underestimated in the
past.},

were calculated at the SCF/6-31G*, MP2(full)/6-31G*,
MP2(full)/6-311+G* levels of theory. For each of these species, the
ground states were also studied at the QCISD(T)/6-311+G(2df) level to
obtain more accurate data. The bonding in these species is found to
involve high-spin ground electronic states (4SIGMA- for LiSi, 3SIGMA-
for BeSi, 4SIGMA- for BSi, 4SIGMA- for NaSi, 3SIGMA- for MgSi and
4SIGMA- for AlSi) in which two electrons occupy bonding pi orbitals.
In each case, the number of unpaired electrons is larger than that
anticipated based on straightforward covalent Si-X sigma-bond
formation with no further rearrangement of electronic configuration.
We suggest that pi2 configurations are favored over pi1 because of the
relatively low sigma-to-pi promotion energies particular to these
species and the low Coulomb and favorable exchange energies of the pi2
situation, and over pi3 and pi4 configurations because the latter
correlate with excited states of Si and have high Coulomb energies.
The pi2 character is then the source of the high-spin nature of the
ground states. Bond dissociation energies were also computed and found
to be 41.5 kcal/mol (LiSi), 28.8 kcal/mol (BeSi), 71.5 kcal/mol (BSi),

of the rate coefficients on the population of the excited fine-

the lack of SiO detections at low temperatures and densities, the

are of double zeta plus polarization quality and the CI method used is
of the multireference double-excitation (MRD-CI) variety including
individualized configuration selection and energy extrapolation. By
including up to 17 reference species to generate the MRD-CI spaces (of
orders up to 150000) and by supplementing the AO basis with f
functions it is found that the ground state of CN+ is the {$pi$}4
1{$sum$} + species (as in isovalent C2) falling 0.1 eV below the
{$sigmapi$}3 3{$Pi$} state. This result is in significant disagreement
with earlier theoretical predictions on this point, which have
generally tended to place the 3{$Pi$} state at least 0.3 eV below
1{$sum$}+. The importance of using more than a single reference
configuration in the CI calculations is underscored in this example.
For Si2 a similar nearly isoenergetic relationship is noted for its
lowest two electronic states, but in this case the competing states
are 3{$Pi$}u and 3{$sum$}g- with 1{$sum$}g+ found to lie 0.7 eV higher

both show a clear 3{$Pi$} ground state, well separated from both
1{$sum$}+ and 3{$sum$}-, but in SiN + the absolute energy minimum is
found to occur for 3{$sum$}-, whereby the wide variations in the
relative stabilities of all these states from one system to another is
seen to be a consequence of the weakening of {$pi$} bonding relative
to {$sigma$} as second-row atomic character is introduced into these
molecules. Finally generally good agreement is observed between
calculation and experiment in this study, with errors of 0.02 bohr and
70 cm-1 being indicated for known bond lengths and stretching
