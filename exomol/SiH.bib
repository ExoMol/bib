Title = {Dielectric function of a-Si:H based on local network structures},
Journal = PRB,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {83},
Abstract = {For hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers prepared by
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, we have found clear
   relationships between the dielectric function in the ultraviolet/visible
   region and SiH(n) (n = 1-2) local bonding states by applying real-time
   spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared attenuated total reflection
   spectroscopy. In particular, the amplitude of the epsilon(2) spectra
   obtained from various a-Si:H layers is expressed completely by the
   SiH(2) bond density in the a-Si:H and reduces strongly with increasing
   the SiH(2) content, indicating that microvoids present in the a-Si:H
   network are surrounded by the SiH(2) bonding state. On the other hand,
   no significant void formation occurs by the generation of the SiH local
   bonding due to rather dense surrounding structures. Depending on the SiH
   n bonding states, the whole a-Si:H dielectric function shifts toward
   higher energies, as the SiH(n) hydrogen contents in the a-Si:H increase.
   Based on these findings, we have established a new a-Si:H dielectric
   function model that incorporates the void structure terminated with
   SiH(2) and epsilon(2) spectral shift induced by the SiH n local
   structures. This model is appropriate for a wide variety of a-Si:H
   layers deposited at different substrate temperatures and plasma
   conditions and, conversely, allows the characterization of the SiH n
   contents from the a-Si:H dielectric functions in the ultraviolet/visible
   region. From results obtained in this study, the local network
   structures and electronic states of a-Si:H are discussed.},

Title = {Overcoming systematic {DFT} errors for hydrocarbon reaction energies},
Journal = TCA,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {127},
Pages = {429-442},
Abstract = {Despite the widespread use and numerous successful applications of
   density functional theory, descriptions of hydrocarbon reaction energies
   remain problematic. Illustrative examples include large underestimation
   of energies associated with alkane bond separation reactions and poor
   general description of intramolecular dispersion in hydrocarbons (e.g.,
   B3LYP, MAD = 14.1 kcal mol(-1)). More recent, but not readily availably
   functionals, along with efficient posteriori corrections, not only show
   considerable improvement in the energy description of hydrocarbons but
   also help identify the sources of error in traditional DFT. Interactions
   in branched alkanes and compact hydrocarbons are adequately mimicked by
   systems compressed below their typical van der Waals distances. At these
   distances, standard DFT exchange functionals are overly repulsive for
   non-bonded density overlaps, and significant improvement is offered by
   the long-range corrected exchange functionals (e.g., LC-BLYP0.33, MAD =
   5.5 kcal mol(-1)). For those systems, the neglect of long-range
   dispersion is found to be a critical shortcoming, as well as ``overlap
   dispersion{''}, for which non-negligible amounts are captured by the
   correlation functional. Accounting for the missing dispersion
   interactions is of key importance. Accordingly, most noteworthy
   improvements over standard functionals are obtained by using non-local
   van der Waals density functionals (e.g., LC-S-VV09, MAD = 3.6 kcal
   mol(-1), rPW86-VV09, MAD = 5.8 kcal mol(-1)), a dispersion corrected
   double hybrid (B2PLYP-D, MAD = 2.5 kcal mol(-1)), or by the addition of
   an atom pairwise density-dependent dispersion correction to a standard
   functional (e.g., PBE-dDXDM, MAD = 0.8 kcal mol(-1)). To a lesser
   extent, the reduction of the delocalization error (e.g., MCY3, MAD = 6.3
   kcal mol(-1)) or careful parameter fitting (e.g., M06-2X, MAD = 5.6 kcal
   mol(-1)) also lowers the errors.},

Abstract = {A set of 24 mixed silicon hydrides and halides (SiH(n)X(m-n), where X =
   F, Cl; m = 1-4; and n = 0-m) has been investigated using; (1) CCSD(T)
   with the correlation consistent basis sets of double-through
   quintuple-zeta quality; (2) CCSD(T) with the augmented tight d form of
   the correlation consistent basis sets for the second row atoms (Si and
   Cl); and (3) the recently developed correlation consistent composite
   approach (ccCA). Optimized geometries and harmonic vibrational
   frequencies are reported, as well as enthalpies of formation, free
   energies of formation, and dissociation reaction enthalpies.
   Relativistic effects, including atomic spin-orbit coupling and scalar
   relativistic effects, and core-valence correlation, have been accounted
   for via the ccCA formulism. As demonstrated in previous studies, the
   tight d basis sets accelerate the convergence, as compared to the
   standard correlation consistent basis sets, of CCSD(T)-computed
   geometries and energetics of molecular species containing second row,
   main group atoms. The ccCA enthalpies of formation are shown to be
   similar and, on average, better than the corresponding CCSD(T)
   enthalpies of formation for the silicon species. Further, large
   DKH-CCSD(T) computations with explicit inclusion of core-valence and
   scalar relativistic effects have been performed to predict the
   enthalpies of formation of SiHF, SiHCl, SiH(2)F, SiHF(2), SiH(2)Cl, and

   Br, and I from coupled cluster theory (CCSD(T)) calculations with
   effective core potential correlation-consistent basis sets for Br and I.
   To achieve near chemical accuracy (+/-1 kcal/mol), three corrections
   were added to the complete basis set binding energies based on frozen
   core coupled cluster theory energies: a correction for core-valence
   effects, a correction for scalar relativistic effects, and a correction
   for first order atomic spin-orbit effects. Vibrational zero point
   energies were computed at the CCSD(T) level of theory and the C-H and
   Si-H stretches scaled to experiment. The C-H, Si-H, Si-C, C-X, and Si-X
   (X = F, Cl, Br, and 1) bond dissociation energies (BDEs) in the
   halosilanes, halomethysilanes, and methylhalosilanes were predicted.
   Except for methyliodosilane, methyl substitution leads to an increase in
   Si-X BDE when compared to the Si-X BDE in the halosilanes. Except for
   methyliodosilane, halide substitution leads to an increase in the Si-C
   BDE in comparison to the Si-C BDE in methylsilane of 86.9 kcal/mol at 0
   K. Unlike the methylhalosilanes, the halomethylsilanes all show a
   decrease in the Si-C BDE when compared to the Si-C BDE in methylsilane.

Abstract = {Recently, the size extensive, ab initio effective valence shell
   Hamiltonian method for spin-orbit coupling has been suggested. In
   essence, this effective Hamiltonian method is equivalent to the
   quasidegenerate perturbation theory. But the difference lies in
   transforming the original Hamiltonian into an effective Hamiltonian
   acting within a relatively small valence in the effective valence shell
   Hamiltonian method. One advantage of the method is that the spin-orbit
   coupling energies of all valence states for both the neutral species and
   its ions are simultaneously determined with a similar accuracy from a
   single computation of the effective spin-orbit coupling operator. Thus,
   fine structure splittings are predicted for a number of states of each
   system for which neither experiment nor theory is available. To assess
   the accuracy of the effective Hamiltonian method more extensively, test
   calculations are performed for the spin-orbit splittings in the valence
   states of small diatomic hydrides and their ions. The calculated
   spin-orbit splittings are generally in good agreement with experiments

   degenerated within the experimental error for Delta V-SiH >= 4
   vibrational manifolds. The degenerate energy level structure resembles
   that of a diatomic Morse oscillator; the transition energies show a

Pages = {5437-5443},
Abstract = {Radical species produced in catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD),
   often called hot-wire CVD, processes were identified by using a laser
   induced fluorescence technique. Ground state Si atoms could be detected
   at low pressures where collisional processes in the gas phase could be
   ignored. The electronic temperature of Si atoms just after the formation
   on the catalyzer (tungsten) surfaces was 1320 +/- 490 K, when the
   catalyzer temperature was 2300 K. By the addition of 0.5 Pa of Ar, the
   electronic temperature was lowered down to 450 +/- 30 K. The absolute
   density of Si atoms was 3 +/- 1x10(9) cm(-3) at 10 cm below the
   catalyzer when the flow rate and the pressure of SiH4 were 0.5 sccm and
   4 mPa, respectively. This density is just 0.3\% of that of the parent
   SiH4 molecules. However, since the decay rate of Si atoms is fast, it
   can be concluded that atomic silicon is one of the major products on the
   heated catalyzer surfaces. SiH radicals could also be detected, but the
   production rate of this species is two orders of magnitude less than
   that of Si atoms. It was also discovered that volatile SiH4 molecules
   are produced by the atomic hydrogen attack on the amorphous silicon
   deposited on the chamber walls.},

Abstract = {Electron impact total ionization cross-sections of small silicon
   hydrides, SiHn(n=1-4), and fluorides, SiFn(n=1-3), have been calculated

   Previous applications of the BEB theory to the silicon hydrides and
   fluorides have employed a combination of experimental and Koopman's
   theorem binding energies. In the current work binding energies have been
   calculated using the explicitly correlated multiconfigurational spin
   tensor electron propagator (MCSTEP) method which gives highly accurate
   ionization potentials for closed- and open-shell systems. Calculations
   have been performed using cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets with
   multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) reference wave
   functions. Comparisons are made between our MCSCF/MCSTEP and previous
   Hartree-Fock (HF)/Koopman's theorem results and available experimental
   data. The use of improved theoretical data does not have a significant
   effect on the resultant cross-sections; however, our new technique is a

   higher energy as well. The ab initio potential curves and nonadiabatic
   coupling matrix elements for all these systems are obtained from
   multireference single- and double-excitation configuration interaction
   calculations. For all systems, the effect of excited atoms on electron
   capture is examined in addition to that from the ground state. Because
   of a small asymptotic energy defect (near-resonant processes) between
   the initial and closest electron capture channels for almost all
   systems, electron capture cross sections from the ground-state atoms are
   large with values of approximately 10(-16) - 10(-15) cm(2) for all

Title = {SIH, SISI, AND CH BOND ACTIVATION BY COORDINATIVELY UNSATURATED RHCL(PH3)2 - AB-INITIO MOLECULAR-ORBITAL STUDY},
Journal = {J. Am. Chem. Soc.},
Year = {1993},
Volume = {115},
Pages = {6883-6892},
Abstract = {SiH bond activation, oxidative addition of the SiH bond of SiH4 to
   coordinatively unsaturated RhCl (PH3)2, was theoretically investigated
   with an ab initio molecular orbital (MO) method, and its potential
   energy profile was compared with that for CH bond activation, oxidative
   addition of the CH bond of CH4. All the stationary points were
   determined at the MP2 level. While CH bond activation passes through an
   eta2-CH4 complex and a three-centered transition state, SiH bond
   activation is downhill and the eta2-SiH4 complex is a transition state
   for intramolecular rearrangement connecting two silyl hydride complexes,
   the products of SiH bond activation. This difference originates from the
   much larger exothermicity of SiH bond activation due to the weaker SiH
   bond and the stronger RhSi bond compared with the C counterparts. The
   RhSi bond is about 20 kcal/mol stronger than the RhC bond; the large
   electron donation from SiH3 to Rh can take place in the late transition
   metal complex to stabilize the electropositive silyl group. However, the
   order in M-R bond strength depends on the transition metal. In the Zr
   complex, a strong back-donation from Zr to CH3 takes place because of
   the small electronegativity of Zr, resulting in the ZrC bond being
   stronger than the ZrSi bond. For Si2H6, activation of both the SiH and
   the SiSi bond takes place easily, and RhCl(PH3)2(SiH3)2 and
   HRhCl(PH3)2(Si2H5) can rearrange with each other intramolecularly. Also,
   the electron correlation effect on structure and energetics is
   discussed.},

Title = {THERMOCHEMISTRY OF CHN, SIHN (N = 0-4), AND THE CATIONS SIH+, SIH2+, AND SIH3+ - A CONVERGED QUANTUM-MECHANICAL APPROACH},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {1992},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {8389-8406},
Abstract = {We have determined 0 K heats of formation of CH(n) and SiH(n) (n=0-4) as
   well as the cations SiH+, SiH2+, and SiH3+ using large atomic natural
   orbital basis sets and coupled cluster methods including all single,
   double, and (perturbatively) triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)].
   Core-correlation effects on the bond dissociation energies have been
   explicitly evaluated. For the intermediate hydrides CH(n) and SiH(n)
   (n=1-3), heats of formation are determined from theoretical bond
   dissociation energies in two ways: using experimental heats of formation
   of the H and C (or Si) atoms; and using experimental heats of formation
   of the H atom and the parent hydrides CH4 (or SiH4). In principle, this
   procedure allows us to place rigorous upper and lower bounds on the
   heats of formation of the intermediate hydrides. Because our
   theoretically predicted atomization energies are already of high
   quality, estimation of remaining deficiencies in the one-particle basis
   sets can be obtained from extrapolation of observed trends in
   atomization energies upon basis set expansion. These extrapolated
   results are in outstanding agreement with experimental values where they
   are known to high accuracy. For the SiH(n) compounds, a serious problem
   occurs: our predicted atomization energy of SiH4 is larger than that
   obtained from experimental heats of formation for the silicon atom and
   silane. Thus either relativistic effects on the atomization energy of
   SiH4 are large, or the experimental heats of formation of Si and SiH4
   are incompatible. Excepting the atomization energy of SiH4, and thus the
   heats of formation of Si and SiH4, none of our other SiH(n)
   thermochemical predictions (properly interpreted) are clearly
   incompatible with experiment. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions
   are again in outstanding agreement with experimental determinations that
   are most certain.},

From these results, together with a close comparison of similar results on the analogous A 2 Delta state in CH, evidence is given for predissociation following direct vibrational coupling with the X 2 Pi ground state, and the dissociation energy for SiH is determined as D 0 o =26950+or-200 cm -1 . In addition, the lifetime values have been used, together with Franck-Condon factors to establish a small variation of the transition moment, and the absorption oscillator strength for the A-X (0,0) band is determined as f(0,0)=(4.98+or-0.15)*10 -3 .}

abstract = {A demountable hollow cathode discharge cell that is useful for studies of plasmas relevant to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was assembled and demonstrated. Direct current glow discharge decomposition of 10\% silane in helium in this cell at 20 Torr produced silicon-containing cathodic thin films that were subsequently examined with the use of Raman and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. A pulsed dye laser-excited optogalvanic detection technique was used to monitor the presence of a transient molecular intermediate---silicon hydride---in this decomposition plasma. An optogalvanic spectrum of the SiH A2$\Delta$-X2$\pi$ transition near 420 nm is presented. This electronic absorption technique complements other spectroscopic methods for mechanistic studies and optimization of glow discharge CVD plasmas that are currently used for the commercial preparation of technologically important thin film materials such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon. It will be particularly useful for detection of nonluminescent plasma intermediates.},

Our equilibrium results are thus independent of any particular model atmosphere. The condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase. Monatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs, and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Mg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4 ) and enstatite (MgSiO 3 ) cloud formation. Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs. Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in the deep atmospheres of brown dwarfs and EGPs, whereas SiH 4 is dominant in the deep atmosphere of Jupiter and other gas giant planets. Several other Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases become increasingly important with decreasing effective temperature. In principle, a number of Fe, Mg, and Si gases are potential tracers of weather or diagnostic of temperature in substellar atmospheres.}

abstract = {Abstract The potential energy curves (PECs) of eleven Ω states generated from the seven Λ–S bound states of SiH radical are studied in detail using an ab initio quantum chemical method. The \{PECs\} are calculated for internuclear separations from about 0.10 to 1.00 nm by the \{CASSCF\} method, which is followed by the internally contracted \{MRCI\} approach with the Davidson modification. The spin–orbit coupling is accounted for with the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian. Core–valence correlation corrections are included with an aug-cc-pCVTZ basis set. Scalar relativistic correction calculations are made by the third-order Douglas–Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a cc-pV5Z basis set. To discuss the effect of core–electron correlations on the spectroscopic parameters, in particular on the Te, the all-electron basis set, aug-cc-pCVTZ with and without core–electron correlations, is employed to calculate the spin–orbit coupling splitting in the X2Π Λ–S state. The all-electron aug-cc-pCVTZ basis set with core–electron correlations is chosen for the present spin–orbit coupling studies. The convergent behavior of present calculations is discussed with respect to the basis set and level of theory. All the \{PECs\} are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. The spectroscopic parameters of seven Λ–S and eleven Ω bound states are evaluated. The splitting energy of X2Π Λ–S state is determined as 141.12 cm−1, which agrees well with the recent measurements of 142.896 cm−1. Moreover, other spectroscopic parameters are also in excellent agreement with available measurements. It demonstrates that the spectroscopic parameters of eleven Ω bound states reported here can be expected to be reliable predicted ones. }

Title = {A B3LYP hybrid density functional theory study of structural properties, energies, and heats of formation for silicon-hydrogen compounds},
Journal = THEOCHEM,
Year = {2000},
Volume = {497},
Pages = {65-73},
Abstract = {A high level of ab initio and B3LYP hybrid density functional studies
   were performed with the target being to determine both the reliability
   of these two methods for computing energetic properties of small
   silicon-hydrogen compounds, and the accuracy of the currently available
   thermodynamic properties of these compounds. These energies are Si-H and
   Si-Si bond dissociation energies, atomization energies, and heats of
   formation. The hybrid B3LYP ab initio computational study was performed
   in combination with five different basis sets. Currently available
   experimental energies for these compounds have a large experimental
   error, but with the CBSQ(0 K) energies it was possible to narrow these
   experimental values. In general, the B3LYP hybrid DFT method with a
   large basis set computes energies that are slightly below the CBSQ
   values. },

title= {Douglas--Kroll--Hess Theory: a relativistic electrons-only theory for chemistry},
journal= TCA,
year= {2006},
volume= {116},
pages= {241--252},
abstract= {A unitary transformation allows to separate (block-diagonalize) the Dirac Hamiltonian into two parts one part: solely describes electrons, while the other gives rise to negative-energy states, which are the so-called positronic states. The block-diagonal form of the Hamiltonian no longer accounts for the coupling of both kinds of states. The positive-energy (`electrons-only') part can serve as a `fully' relativistic electrons-only theory, which can be understood as a rigorous basis for chemistry. Recent developments of the Douglas--Kroll--Hess (DKH) method allowed to derive a sequence of expressions, which approximate this electrons-only Hamiltonian up to arbitrary-order. While all previous work focused on the numerical stability and accuracy of these arbitrary-order DKH Hamiltonians, conceptual issues and paradoxa of the method were mostly left aside. In this work, the conceptual side of DKH theory is revisited in order to identify essential aspects of the theory to be distinguished from purely computational consideration.},
