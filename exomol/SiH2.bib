	abstract = {Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is used to measure spatially- and time-resolved SiH2 radical densities in pure SiH4 , H2 /SiH4 and Ar/SiH4 radio-frequency glow discharges used for amorphous silicon thin film deposition. Absolute density calibration is obtained by a Rayleigh scattering experiment in pure nitrogen. Typical SiH2 densities on the plasma axis are 1-10 × 1016 m-3 . Measurements of the SiH2 decay in the afterglow of argon/silane discharges are used to determine for the first time the SiH2 loss probability on a-Si:H surfaces and to confirm the reaction rate coefficient of SiH2 with SiH4 . We find = 0.6±0.15 and kr = (2.3±0.5) × 10-17 m3 s-1 molecule-1 at T = 500 K and p = 9 Pa. The measured SiH2 densities are compared to those calculated by a previously published two-dimensional plasma simulation code.}

	journal = JPD,
	abstract = {From the laser-induced fluorescence measurements of the decay rate of SiH2 and SiH densities in the afterglow of a RF SiH4-Ar discharge, the rate constants for the reactions of SiH2 and SiH with SiH4 have been determined at pressures below 1 Torr. The rate constants obtained at 70 mTorr for the SiH2+SiH4 and SiH+SiH4 reactions are 4.3*10-11 and 4.8*10-11 cm3 S-1 per molecule, respectively. The rate constants of the two reactions decrease with decreasing pressure in a manner consistent with the high-pressure (>or=1 Torr) data available in the literature, indicating that, despite the present low-pressure conditions, the three-body association reactions producing, respectively, Si2H6 and Si2H5 are the dominant reaction channels. Measurements were also carried out using a SiH4-He discharge at 200 and 400 mTorr, giving rate constants somewhat smaller than those obtained using a SiH4-Ar discharge, possibly because of incomplete thermalization of SiH2 and SiH. The SiHx (x=0-3) production frequencies in SiH4 plasmas are discussed on the basis of the measured reaction rate constants.}

required the improved performance of the desktop computers of 1991, with the
spectral measurements made with the enhanced spectrometers. As the performance
of desktop computers has been steadily improving, it is much easier to compare
the experimental values with those of the current desktop instrumentation.},

Pages = {1332-1338},
abstract = {The ability of time-independent nonadiabatic transition state theory
(NA-TST) to reproduce intersystem crossing dynamics obtained from the more computationally
demanding Tully fewest switches trajectory surface hopping method is investigated.
The two approaches are applied to the intersystem crossing between the ground 1A1
state and lowest energy 3B1 state of SiH2, coupled through the spin–orbit interaction.
For NA-TST, the transition probabilities are calculated using the Landau–Zener formula
and the Delos formula which accounts for tunneling. The fewest switches method produces
rate constants of 7.6 × 1011 s–1 for the triplet to singlet transition and 5.2 × 1011
s–1 for the singlet to triplet transition, using a first-order kinetics model. This
corresponds to a triplet electronic state lifetime of 781 fs. The NA-TST predicted
rate constants are 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller, leading to a larger triplet
state lifetime, as compared with the fewest switches method. This discrepancy
cannot be explained by the difference in transition probabilities obtained from
NA-TST and fewest switches molecular dynamics, and it is believed to be a result
of the NA-TST semilocal description of nonadiabatic transitions in the vicinity
of the intersystem crossing. Also, the larger triplet state lifetime obtained
from NA-TST could be a result of the quantum sampling of rovibrational states,
which is missing in classical trajectories traversing the crossing seam.},

Abstract = {The coupled-cluster single-double withy a perturbative triple

   correlation-consistent basis set (cc-pV5Z) of Dunning and co-workers is
   employed to determine the equilibrium geometry, dissociation energy and
   vibrational frequencies of the SiH2 (C-2 nu, X(1)A(1)) radical. By
   comparison, excellent agreement can be found between the present results
   and the experiments. The values obtained at cc-pV5Z are 0.15163 rim for
   the equilibrium bond length RSi-H, 92.363 degrees for the bond angle
   alpha of H-Si-H, 3.2735 eV for the dissociation energy D-e(HSi-H) and
   1020.0095, 2074.8742 and 2076.4762 cm(-1) for the vibrational
   frequencies nu(1) (a(1)), nu(2) (a(1)) and nu(3) (a(1)), respectively.
   The equilibrium geometry, harmonic frequency and potential energy curve
   of the SiH((XII)-I-2) radical are calculated at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z
   level of theory. The ab initio points are fitted to the Murrell-Sorbie
   function with the least-squares method. The spectroscopic parameters,
   whether directly determined by the Gaussian03 program package or they
   are derived from the analytic potential energy function, conform almost
   perfectly with the available experimental results. The analytic
   potential energy function of the SiH2(C-2 nu, X(1)A(1)) radical is
   derived by using the many-body expansion theory. This function correctly
   describes the configuration and dissociation energy of the SiH2(C-2 nu,
   X(1)A(1)) radical. Two symmetrical saddle points have been found at
   (0.312, 0.160 nm) and (0.160, 0.312 nm), respectively. And the barrier
   height is found to be 0.5084 eV.},

   the transition dipole surfaces, which were reported in our previous
   paper {[}J. Chem. Phys. 122, 144307 (2005)]. The photodissociation
   spectrum consists of a broadband and a number of sharp peaks. For SiH2

   vibrational levels of the B state and the broadbands are nearly
   independent of the photon energy. The broadband for SiHD increases
   steeply with the photon energy above 30 000 cm(-1). The flux leaving the

   tilde-(B) over tilde, and (A) over tilde-(B) over tilde system. The
   global PESs were determined by the multireference configuration
   interaction calculations with the Davidson correction and the
   interpolant moving least-squares method combined with the Shepard
   interpolation. The obtained FCFs for the (X) over tilde-(A) over tilde
   and (A) over tilde-(B) over tilde systems exhibit that the bending mode
   is strongly enhanced in the excitation since the equilibrium bond angle
   greatly varies with the three states; the barrier to linearity is
   evaluated to be 21 900 cm(-1) for the (X) over tilde state, 6400 cm(-1)
   for the (A) over tilde state, and 230-240 cm(-1) for the (B) over tilde
   state. The theoretical lifetimes for the pure bending levels of the (A)
   over tilde and (B) over tilde states were calculated from the
   fluorescence decay rates for the (A) over tilde-(X) over tilde, (B) over
   tilde-(A) over tilde, and (B) over tilde-(X) over tilde emissions. (C)

Abstract = {We report a theoretical study of the two lowest singlet electronic
   states ((X) over tilde (1)A(1) and (A) over tilde B-1(1)) of silylene
   SiH2. These states become degenerate as a (1)Delta(g) state at linear
   configurations and are subject to the Renner effect. In ab initio
   calculations we have determined the potential energy and dipole moment
   surfaces for each state, and the transition moment surface between the
   states. Parameterized analytical functions have been fitted through the
   various sets of ab initio points, and the parameter values obtained for
   the potential energy surfaces have been further refined in fittings to
   experimental spectroscopic data. In these latter fittings, we use as
   input data experimentally derived energy differences together with ab
   initio points. In this manner, we achieve refined potential energy
   surfaces that behave reasonably also in regions of configuration space
   that are not sampled by the wavefunctions of the states for which
   experimentally derived energies are available. The calculation of
   rovibronic energies, the fittings to experimentally derived energies,
   and simulations of (A) over tilde B-1(1) --> (X) over tilde (1)A(1)
   emission spectra of SiH2 have been carried out with the RENNER program
   system. The higher excited vibrational states of (H) over tilde (1)A(1)
   SiH2 form polyads of heavily interacting states and many polyad states
   have been observed in dispersed fluorescence studies. The present
   theoretical work shows that owing to the heavy interaction between the
   states in the polyads, it is difficult to obtain unambiguous assignments
   for them.},

   predict the experimental singlet-triplet separations within 0.02 eV (0.5

Volume = {22},
Number = {16},
Pages = {3250-3256},
Abstract = {The singlet-triplet energy difference in CH2 and SiH2 was calculated at
   the CASSCF level of theory using large Gaussian basis sets that included
   f-type functions. The total energy was separated into nuclear repulsion
   and electronic energy, and the latter was further decomposed into the
   contributions coming from the two electrons highest in energy (the
   ``frontier{''} electrons, denoted by ``f{''}) and from all the other
   electrons (denoted by ``c{''} for ``core{''}). The contribution of the
   frontier electrons was further decomposed into the following terms:
   E-(f) which is the sum of the kinetic energy and the attraction energy
   to the nucleus of the two frontier electrons and their repulsion energy
   from all other electrons, and E-ee((f)), the repulsion energy between
   the two frontier electrons. The results are used to explain why CH2 is a
   ground state triplet (lying ca. 10 kcal/mol lower in energy than the
   singlet) while SiH2 is a ground state singlet (with the triplet lying
   ca. 20 kcal/mol higher in energy). The major conclusions are as follows:
   (1) In addition to the frontier electrons, the ``core{''} electrons and
   the nuclear repulsion energy also affect the singlet-triplet gap. (2)
   About 60\% of the singlet-triplet energy difference between CH2 and SiH2
   of 29 kcal/mol may be attributed to the E-ee((f)) term. (3) The
   remaining 40\% of the energy difference can be interpreted as resulting
   from a balance between E-(f), the energy of the ``core{''} electrons
   (E-(c)), and the nuclear repulsion energy (E-nuc); these terms may be
   related to the HOMO-LUMO energy difference, which is often used in
   qualitative discussions of singlet-triplet energy gaps. A detailed
   discussion of the results is presented.},

Abstract = {The scarcity of triplet silylenes compared with triplet carbenes can be

   size of the silicon orbitals leads to a decrease in the repulsion of the
   nonbonding electrons in the singlet state and hence their
   energy-lowering separation in the triplet state is less capable of
   compensating an attendant promotion energy. Calculations suggested that
   the effect of bulky substituents must be supplemented by a reduction of
   their electronegativity in order to reduce the promotion energy to the
   point that a triplet ground state can be achieved at an attainable bond
   angle. The culmination of this approach has been the generation of a

Abstract = {The molecular structures and electron affinities of the SiHn/SiHn- (n =
   1-4) and Si2H(n)/Si2Hn- (n = 0-6) molecules, as well as the silicon
   atom, have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and
   hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional theory. Specifically, four
   different types of electron affinities are reported in this work: the
   adiabatic electron affinity (EA(ad)), zero-point corrected EA(ad)
   (EA(zero)), the vertical electron affinity (EA(vert)), and vertical
   detachment energy (VDE). The basis set used in this work is of
   double-zeta plus polarization quality with additional s- and p-type
   diffuse functions, and is denoted as DZP(++). Of the six different
   density functionals used in this work, the BHLYP functional predicted
   the best molecular structures, and the B3LYP functional predicted the
   best electron affinities. When compared to the available six
   experimental electron affinities, the B3LYP functional has an average
   absolute error of just 0.06 eV. We predict the unknown electron
   affinities for Si2H2 (dibridged), Si2H3, Si2H4 (disilene), and Si2H5
   (disilyl radical) to be 0.45, 2.21, 1.34, and 1.85 eV, respectively.
   These predictions assume that the (unknown) molecular structure of each
   anion is analogous to the known structure of the corresponding neutral
   molecule. The most interesting aspect of the present research is that
   for Si2H2- and Si2H4-, the lowest energy structures are qualitatively
   different from those of the neutrals. For Si2H2- the disilavinylidene
   structure H2SiSi-, is predicted to lie 24 kcal/mol below the dibridged
   or ``butterfly{''} anion. For Si2H4- the silylsilylene anion H3SiSiH-,
   is predicted to lie 3 kcal/mol below the disilene anion structure
   H2SiSiH2-. The zero-point corrected adiabatic electron affinities of
   disilavinylidene, silylsilylidyne, and silylsilylene are 1.87, 1.01, and
   1.71 eV, respectively. The saturated closed shell systems SiH4 and Si2H6
   do not have conventional electron affinities.},

   concentration of the order of 10(10) SiH2/cm(3). The spectrum spans the
   region between 15350 and 16100 cm(-1). Rotational transitions have been
   assigned to levels up to J=16 and K-a=9, with Delta K-a up to 5, Delta

   Renner-Teller and spin-orbit interactions between both electronic states
   and the B-3(1) state, predicted to be between them. However, the

   coupling matrix elements are obtained for each triplet sublevel
   separately and are analyzed in an intuitively appealing fashion in terms
   of vectorial contributions from individual atoms and individual natural
   hybrid orbital pairs. CASSCF(6,6) results for S-0-T-1 spin-orbit

   polarized double-zeta basis set appears adequate. However, convergence
   with respect to the extent of electron correlation has not yet been
   reached. at the CASSCF(6,6) level, whose results appear to be only
   semiquantitative. The experimental D' and E' values for CH2 are
   reproduced within 5\% at the CISD/aug-cc-pVTZ level, but the results
   obtained with less adequate electron correlation procedures and/or with

   spin-orbit coupling in CH2 and SiH2 as a function of the valence angle
   agree with expectations based on the algebraic 2-electrons-in-2-orbitals

   dominated by spin-spin dipolar coupling, whereas D' in SiH2 is predicted
   to be dominated by spin-orbit coupling.},

   complete active space (GAS) SCF, configuration interaction with single
   and double excitations (CISD), and CASSCF second-order (SO) CI levels of
   theory were employed with eight distinct basis sets. The zeroth-order
   wave functions of the ground ((X) over tilde (1)A(1) or 1 (1)A(1)) and
   (B) over tilde (1)A(1) (or 2 (1)A(1)) excited states are appropriately
   described by the first and second eigenvectors of the TCSCF
   secular-equations. The TCSCF-CISD, CASSCF, and CASSCF-SOCI wave
   functions for the (B) over tilde (1)A(1) (or 2 (1)A(1)) state were
   obtained by following the second root of the CISD, CASSCF, and SOCI
   Hamiltonian matrices. At the highest level of theory, the CASSCF-SOCI
   method with the triple zeta plus triple polarization augmented with two
   sets of higher angular momentum functions and two sets of diffuse
   functions basis set {[}TZ3P (2f, 2d) + 2diff], the energy separation

   7180 cm(-1)), which is in excellent agreement with the experimental T-0
   value of 21.0 kcal/mol (0.910 eV, 7340 cm(-1)). With the same method the
   T-0 value for the (A) over tilde B-1(1) - (X) over tilde (1)A(1)

   kcal/mol (1.925 eV, 15530 cm(-1)). The T-0 value for the (B) over tilde
   (1)A(1) - (X) over tilde (1)A(1) separation is determined to be 79.6
   kcal/mol (3.452 eV, 27 840 cm(-1)). After comparison of theoretical and
   experimental T-0 values for the (a) over tilde B-3(1) and (A) over tilde
   B-1(1) states and previous studies, error bars for the (B) over tilde
   (1)A(1) state are estimated to be +/- 1.5 kcal/mol (+/- 525 cm(-1)). The

Abstract = {The silylene radical (SiH2) was detected in reacting high temperature
   mixtures of disilane (Si2H6) highly diluted in argon by time-resolved

   measured absorption was caused by a single line transition in the A-X
   (0,2,0)-(0,0,0) band of SiH2 which was exclusively initiated by the
   narrow bandwidth laser source. The absorption profiles were measured in
   the reaction zone behind reflected shock waves at temperatures between
   1000 and 1900 K, and at pressures 0.2 bar less than or equal to p less
   than or equal to 1.3 bar. Several calibration experiments were performed
   at temperatures above 1500 K and low initial Si2H6 concentrations. To
   establish the connection between measured absorption and the SiH2
   concentrations, numerical simulations on disilane pyrolysis were
   performed based on a reaction kinetic model. From both the measured
   absorption and the calculated SiH2 concentrations the silylene
   absorption cross section was determined to be sigma(SiH2) = 1.3 x

Abstract = {Experimental data on SiH2 have been reanalyzed to show the existence of
   a large number of strong, but erratic rotational perturbations which are
   correlated with anomalous fluorescence lifetimes. These results have
   been interpreted using a model for the combined effects of Renner-Teller
   coupling between the two singlet states and spin-orbit coupling with the
   lowest triplet. In this model, the vibrational and K-type rotational
   levels of the X1A1 and the AB1 states of SiH2 have been fitted by least
   squares to give a pair of Born-Oppenheimer curves for the combining
   electronic states. These have been used to calculate the interaction
   matrix elements of the spin-orbit coupling with the a3B1 state. Large
   interactions between the 1B1 and the 3B1 states are calculated even
   though the direct interaction of the states is forbidden. Thus we can
   rationalize the existence of both the strong rotational perturbations
   and the unusual radiative lifetimes. Lack of knowledge of the exact
   location of the triplet state, and of the rovibronic structure
   associated with this state, precludes a detailed fit of the type
   recently made for CH2. We have also calculated the rotational constants
   for a range of vibronic states of SiH2. Analogous rotational constants
   and band origins of SiD2 have also been calculated using the potential
   curves derived from the fit to SiH2. The agreement between the
   calculated origins and those measured experimentally is very satisfactory.},

Abstract = {Based on ab initio three-dimensional functions of potential energy,
   electric dipole and transition moments, the rovibronic energy levels,
   eigenfunctions, and radiative transition probabilities have been
   calculated for several triatomic molecules (H2O, HDO, SiH2, and the
   Renner-Teller system of NH2). Using ultrashort infrared picosecond laser
   pulses;the state-selective multiphoton excitations of the v1 = 4
   (symmetric stretching) vibrational eigenstate of these molecules as well
   as the corresponding diatomics OH, SiH, and NH have been investigated.
   The OH stretching mode in HDO and in H2O can be selectively populated.
   Strong anharmonic coupling (SiH2) or Renner-Teller coupling to another
   electronic state (NH2) may, however, considerably reduce the achievable
   state selectivity.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1992},
Volume = {96},
Number = {1},
Pages = {44-52},
Abstract = {Silylene radicals, SiH, and SiD2, are generated in a supersonic free jet
   by ArF laser (193 nm) photolysis of phenylsilane and
   phenylsilane-alpha-d3, respectively. LIF excitation and dispersed
   fluorescence spectra are measured for the v2 vibronic bands of the
   approximately A B-1(1) -approximately X 1A1 transition. The
   heterogeneous predissociation to Si (3p) + H-2 is proposed from the
   anomalous rotational structure in the excitation spectra; the rotational
   lines of the r(1) subbranch (K(a)' = 0 <-- K(a){''} 1) have stronger
   intensity than those of the r(0) subbranch (K(a)' = 1 <-- K(a){''} 0),
   though the latter is expected to be stronger due to the low temperature
   Boltzmann distribution in the jet. The time-resolved excitation spectra
   demonstrate shorter lifetime of K(a') = 1 rovibronic levels in the
   approximately A B-1(1) state. The heterogeneous predissociation is
   interpreted with the second order perturbation: approximately A
   B-1(1)-(a-type Coriolis) --> approximately X 1A1-(spin-orbit) -->
   approximately a B-3(1) --> Si(3P) + H-2. It is demonstrated
   experimentally that there is a potential barrier associated with the
   dissociation path of approximately a B-3(1) --> Si(3P) + H-2 the height
   of which is estimated to be 1540-2160 cm-1 from the bottom of the
   approximately A B-1(1) state. The electronic transition moment of the
   approximately A B-1(1) - approximately X 1A1 transition is estimated to
   be \textbackslash{}mu(e)\textbackslash{}2 = 0.26e2a0(2) from the
   Einstein equation for spontaneous emission using measured fluorescence
   lifetimes for single rovibronic levels with K(a') = 0 and calculated
   Franck-Condon factors. The onset of a second predissociation channel,
   approximately A B-1(1) --> Si(1D) + H-2, at the (0,7,0) vibronic level
   of SiH2 approximately A B-1(1) is manifested as a sharp decrease in the
   observed fluorescence lifetime for the upsilon-2' = 7, J' = 0 level
   relative to that predicted for a pure radiative lifetime.},

   Core-correlation effects on the bond dissociation energies have been
   explicitly evaluated. For the intermediate hydrides CH(n) and SiH(n)
   (n=1-3), heats of formation are determined from theoretical bond
   dissociation energies in two ways: using experimental heats of formation
   of the H and C (or Si) atoms; and using experimental heats of formation
   of the H atom and the parent hydrides CH4 (or SiH4). In principle, this
   procedure allows us to place rigorous upper and lower bounds on the
   heats of formation of the intermediate hydrides. Because our
   theoretically predicted atomization energies are already of high
   quality, estimation of remaining deficiencies in the one-particle basis
   sets can be obtained from extrapolation of observed trends in
   atomization energies upon basis set expansion. These extrapolated
   results are in outstanding agreement with experimental values where they
   are known to high accuracy. For the SiH(n) compounds, a serious problem
   occurs: our predicted atomization energy of SiH4 is larger than that
   obtained from experimental heats of formation for the silicon atom and
   silane. Thus either relativistic effects on the atomization energy of
   SiH4 are large, or the experimental heats of formation of Si and SiH4
   are incompatible. Excepting the atomization energy of SiH4, and thus the
   heats of formation of Si and SiH4, none of our other SiH(n)
   thermochemical predictions (properly interpreted) are clearly
   incompatible with experiment. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions

abstract = {The unimolecular decomposition dynamics of Si2H4 have been investigated
using classical trajectory methods on a global potential‐energy surface fitted to
the results of ab initio calculations and the available experimental data. The
required phase‐space averages are computed using Metropolis sampling techniques.
It is found that unless the parameters of the Markov walk are adjusted for each
different type of atom present, extremely long Markov walks are required to adequately
cover the phase space of the system. Microcanonical rate coefficients for the
decomposition of Si2H4 into all open channels are reported at energies in the
range 5.0<E<9.0 eV. The most important dissociation channel over this energy
range is three‐center elimination of molecular hydrogen leading to H2 Si=Si.
At energies below 7.0 eV, the other channels are, in order of importance, Si–Si
bond rupture, four‐center H2 elimination, and simple Si–H bond rupture. At or
above 8.0 eV, four‐center H2 elimination replaces Si–Si bond rupture as the second
most important decomposition channel. The energy dependence of the rate coefficients
is well described by an RRK expression. Three‐center H2 elimination involves a
simultaneous rupture of both Si–H bonds whereas the four‐center elimination is
found to proceed by a hydrogen atom transfer process followed by H2 elimination.
Except for a small propensity to form H2 with excess rotational energy, the energy
partitioning among the products is nearly statistical. A comparison study of the
decomposition of Si2H4 complexes formed by the recombination of two SiH2 molecules
shows that the rates for both three‐ and four‐center H2 elimination are in agreement
with those computed using a statistical distribution of the same internal energy.
The rate for Si–Si bond rupture, however, is significantly larger for Si2H4 complexes
formed by SiH2 recombination than for Si2H4 molecules with the same internal energy
randomly distributed. The decomposition dynamics of SiH2 on the global surface are
also reported.},

abstract = {This paper reports a comprehensive theoretical examination of the re
and r0 geometrical structures, harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies,
and infrared intensities ofX̃2Π SiH, X̃ 1A1, ã 3B1, and Ã1B1 SiH2, X̃2A1 SiH3, and
X̃1A1 SiH4. Both self-consistent-field (SCF) and configuration interaction singles
and doubles (CISD) methods have been employed with two basis sets (B1 and B2) of
double-zeta plus polarization (DZ +P) and triple-zeta plus double polarization (TZ+2P)
quality. For SiH the B2 CISD parameters re = 1.5214 Å, r0 = 1.5326 Å, ωe = 2062
cm−1, and v0 = 1985 cm−1 are in excellent agreement with the experimental values
re = 1.5201 Å, r0 = 1.5313 Å, ωe = 2042 cm−1, and v0 = 1971 cm−1. The B2 CISD αi
rovibrational constants for SiH2D2, SiH4, SiD4, and SiHD3 when utilized to correct
experimental A0, B0, and C0 rotational constants give re = 1.4735 Å for SiH4.
With the same procedure, re(SiH) = 1.5141 Å and θe (HSiH) = 92.0° are found
for X̃ 1A1 SiH2, and re(SiH) = 1.4871 Å and θe(HSiH) = 121.8° are found for Ã1B1 SiH2.
All of these experimentally derived re parameters are in excellent agreement with
the B2 CISD re structures for X̃ 1A1 SiH4, X̃1A1 SiH2, and Ã1B1 SiH2. For ã3B1 SiH2,
re = 1.4768 Å, θe = 118.3°, and Te = 19.6 kcal/mol are predicted. The B2 CISD
harmonic vibrational frequencies for the SiH stretches of SiH4 are only 1–2% too
large, and the corresponding theoretical anharmonicities are in error by less than
7 cm−1. Using the SiH4 data to separately scale the B2 CISD ω3 and x3 values for
X̃1A1 SiH2, ν3 = 1981 cm−1 is obtained, which confirms the recent experimental
frequencies of Fredin, Hauge, Kafafi, and Margrave. In a similar fashion ν1 = 2117
cm−1, ν2 = 892 cm−1, and ν3 = 2180 cm−1 are predicted for ã3B1 SiH2 and ν1 = 2016
cm−1 and ν3 = 2115 cm−1 for Ã1B1 SiH2. The B2 CISD geometrical parameters for X̃2A1
SiH3 are re(SiH) = 1.4768 Å and θe(HSiH) = 111.1°, and the final (scaled) B2
CISD fundamental frequencies are ν1 = 2150 cm−1, ν2 = 773 cm−1, ν3 = 2180 cm−1,
and ν4 = 933 cm−1. These frequencies definitely show that the 1999, 1955, and 996
cm−1 IR absorptions of Milligan and Jacox are not attributable to SiH3. Finally,
at the highest level of theory used here, a classical inversion barrier of 5.8
kcal/mol is obtained for SiH3.},
