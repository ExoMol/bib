   for the first time to the bands 2v(4), v(2)+ v(4), and 2v(2) of the
   (SiD4)-Si-28 molecule. Numerous ``hot{''} dyad-pentad transitions (in
   general, 5545 ``hot{''} transitions) were also assigned for the first
   time in the region of 600-760 cm(-1). Rotational, centrifugal

abstract = {The infrared spectra of SiH4 in natural abundance (92.23% of 28SiH4,
4.68% of 29SiH4, and 3.09% of 30SiH4) were measured in the region of 600–1200 cm−1
with a Bruker IFS 120HR Fourier transform spectrometer, analyzed and compared with
the results available in the literature. More than 3500 transitions with were
assigned to the dyad bands ν4 and ν2 of 28SiH4 (the band ν2 is allowed in Raman,
but forbidden in absorption spectra for symmetry reasons, and its transitions
appear in absorption spectra only because of strong Coriolis interaction with
the ν4 band). Rotational, centrifugal distortion, tetrahedral splitting, and
interaction parameters for the ground, (0100) and (0001) vibrational states were
determined from the fit of experimental line positions. The obtained set of
parameters reproduces the initial experimental data with accuracy close to experimental
uncertainties. The results of the analogous analyses of the 29SiH4 and 30SiH4
isotopologues are also presented (the numbers of the assigned transitions are
here more than 1360 and 1120). An further analysis of about 790 experimental
ro-vibrational lines in the dyad region of 28SiH4 was performed using the Voigt
profile to simulate the measured line shape and to determine experimental line
intensities. A set of 4 effective dipole moment parameters for the dyad of 28SiH4
was obtained on that basis from the weighted fit, which reproduce the initial
experimental intensities of about 790 lines with the . Analogous analyses were
made for the two other isotopic species, 29SiH4, and 30SiH4. A detailed line list
of transitions in the region of 750–1150 cm−1 is generated. The half-widths of 40
ro-vibrational lines are studied from the multi-spectrum analysis, and self-pressure

abstract = {A new nine-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment

The PES, CBS-F12HL, reproduces all four fundamental term values for 28SiH4 with
sub-wavenumber accuracy, resulting in an overall root-mean-square error of 0.63
cm−1. The PES is based on explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with
extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, and incorporates a range of higher-level
additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation,
higher-order coupled cluster terms, and scalar relativistic effects. Systematic
errors in computed intra-band rotational energy levels are reduced by empirically
refining the equilibrium geometry. The resultant Si–H bond length is in excellent
agreement with previous experimental and theoretical values. Vibrational transition
moments, absolute line intensities of the ν3 band, and the infrared spectrum
for 28SiH4 including states up to J = 20 and vibrational band origins up to 5000
cm−1 are calculated and compared with available experimental results. The DMS
tends to marginally overestimate the strength of line intensities. Despite this,
band shape and structure across the spectrum are well reproduced and show good
agreement with experiment. We thus recommend the PES and DMS for future use},

Abstract = {The introduction of room temperature continuous wave external-cavity
 quantum cascade lasers (EC-QCLs) with narrow linewidths has greatly
 facilitated high resolution spectroscopy over wide spectral ranges in
 the mid-infrared (MIR) region. Using the wide tuning range of an EC-QCL
 we have measured the absolute line strengths of many P-branch
 transitions of the stretching dyad of the v(3) fundamental band of
 (SiH4)-Si-28 between 2096 and 2178 cm(-1). Furthermore, the high
 spectral resolution available has enabled us to resolve and measure
 representative examples of the tetrahedral splittings associated with
 each component of the P-branch. The positions of these components are in
 excellent agreement with spherical top data system (STDS) predictions
 and theoretical transitions from the TDS spectroscopic database for
 spherical top molecules. These are the first measurements of these line
 strengths of (SiH4)-Si-28 and are an example of the applicability of
 high-powered, widely tunable EC-QCLs to high resolution spectroscopy.

Abstract = {Stretching vibrational band intensities of XH4 molecules were

 the local mode potential energy surfaces. The ab initio DMS of CH4 and

 reproduced most of the observed intensities within a factor of 1.5. The
 effective DMS of CH4 and SiH4 were obtained by adjusting some selected
 high-order terms in the ab initio DMS to fit the observed intensities.
 They were applied to the corresponding deuterated isotopomers yielding
 better results than the ab initio DMS. The intensities of the
 combination bands are mainly due to the interbond cross terms in the DMS
 for SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4, while for CH4, both diagonal and cross terms
 are important. The relatively strong combination band that has
 comparable intensity with the pure overtone was predicted at the fourth
 local mode manifold for SnH4. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

 and silane were found to form in the dusty outflow significantly beyond
 both the dust formation and gas acceleration zones. Specifically,
 ammonia was found to form before silane in a region of decaying gas
 turbulence (greater than or equal to 20R({*})), while the silane is
 produced in a region of relatively smooth gas flow much farther from the
 star (greater than or similar to 80R({*})). The depletion of gas-phase
 SiS onto grains soon after dust formation may fuel silane-producing
 reactions on the grain surfaces. For VY CMa, a combination of
 interferometric and spectral observations suggest that NH3, is forming
 near the termination of the gas acceleration phase in a region of high
 gas turbulence (similar to 40R({*})).},

 levels. A root mean square deviation of 0.6 cm(-1) was achieved for both
 species. The same parameters were used to predict the energy levels of
 XD4, XHD3 and XH3D. The differences between the observed and predicted
 energy levels show slight but systematic deviations for the XD
 stretching levels which are discussed in relation with possible
 anharmonic interactions between the stretching and the bending modes and
 with the mass dependence of the indirect kinetic and potential couplings
 of the XH or XD bond oscillators through the bend.},

 constrained to be less than 4 x 10(-5) M. yr-1. Gathering evidence for a
 recent decline in the mass-loss rate is strengthened by analysis of the
