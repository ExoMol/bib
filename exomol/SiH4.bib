  Abstract                 = {The introduction of room temperature continuous wave external-cavity
 quantum cascade lasers (EC-QCLs) with narrow linewidths has greatly
 facilitated high resolution spectroscopy over wide spectral ranges in
 the mid-infrared (MIR) region. Using the wide tuning range of an EC-QCL
 we have measured the absolute line strengths of many P-branch
 transitions of the stretching dyad of the v(3) fundamental band of
 (SiH4)-Si-28 between 2096 and 2178 cm(-1). Furthermore, the high
 spectral resolution available has enabled us to resolve and measure
 representative examples of the tetrahedral splittings associated with
 each component of the P-branch. The positions of these components are in
 excellent agreement with spherical top data system (STDS) predictions
 and theoretical transitions from the TDS spectroscopic database for
 spherical top molecules. These are the first measurements of these line
 strengths of (SiH4)-Si-28 and are an example of the applicability of
 high-powered, widely tunable EC-QCLs to high resolution spectroscopy.

 high-order terms in the ab initio DMS to fit the observed intensities.
 They were applied to the corresponding deuterated isotopomers yielding
 better results than the ab initio DMS. The intensities of the
 combination bands are mainly due to the interbond cross terms in the DMS
 for SiH4, GeH4, and SnH4, while for CH4, both diagonal and cross terms
 are important. The relatively strong combination band that has
 comparable intensity with the pure overtone was predicted at the fourth

 assumptions of spherical symmetry and uniform outflow, these new data
 permitted the molecular stratification around carbon star IRC +10216 and
 red supergiant VY CMa to be investigated. For IRC + 10216, both ammonia
 and silane were found to form in the dusty outflow significantly beyond
 both the dust formation and gas acceleration zones. Specifically,
 ammonia was found to form before silane in a region of decaying gas
 turbulence (greater than or equal to 20R({*})), while the silane is
 produced in a region of relatively smooth gas flow much farther from the
 star (greater than or similar to 80R({*})). The depletion of gas-phase
 SiS onto grains soon after dust formation may fuel silane-producing
 reactions on the grain surfaces. For VY CMa, a combination of
 interferometric and spectral observations suggest that NH3, is forming
 near the termination of the gas acceleration phase in a region of high
 gas turbulence (similar to 40R({*})).},

  Abstract                 = {The infrared spectrum of (SiH4)-Si-28 between 2930 and 3300 cm(-1) was
 recorded using the Laboratoire de Physique Moleculaire et Applications
 (LPMA.) Fourier transform spectrometer. The instrumental response
 function width chosen makes it possible to obtain a Doppler-limited
 spectrum. The observed spectrum belongs to the tetrad built with one
 quantum of stretching mode (nu(1) or nu(3)) and one quantum of bending
 mode (nu(2) or nu(4)). The excited states are formed from eight
 vibrational sublevels: nu(1) + nu(2)(E), nu(1) + nu(4)(F-2), nu(2) +
 nu(3)(F-1 + F-2), and nu(3) + nu(4)(A(1) + E + F-1 + F-2). The intricacy
 of the upper states was resolved using the variations of the line
 strength between the 297 K and 209 K spectra and the precise knowledge
 of the ground slate. For analysis with the vibrational extrapolation
 method, we used the previous results for the fundamental bending dyad
 (nu(2)/nu(4)) and the stretching dyad (nu(1)/nu(3)). The Hamiltonian is
 expanded through the sixth order of approximation for the ground and the
 bending states, the fifth order for the stretching states, and the
 fourth order for the tetrad states in the Amat-Nielsen classification.
 About 1033 pieces of data are used in the analysis and the weighted
 standard deviation obtained is 4.6 x 10(-3) (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

  Abstract                 = {A high-resolution infrared spectrum of the (2000) stretching vibrational
 band of silane, SiH4, has been recorded and analyzed. The rotational
 constants obtained, together with those of the (n000), n = 3, 4, 5 bands
 reported earlier, show a striking effect of local mode vibrations on
 rotational constants and an evolution of local mode vibrations from the
 first overtone. The vibrational dependence of the rotational constants
 is calculated with the customary normal mode model including
 Darling-Dennison resonances. The calculated and observed constants are
 in good agreement. The results also show that states with large
 vibrational quantum number play important roles for the emergence of the
 local mode vibrations in real molecules.},
