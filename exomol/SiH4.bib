Title = {Monosilane Worlds: Sub-{N}eptunes with Atmospheres Shaped by Reduced Magma
   Oceans},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {987},
Abstract = {High-precision infrared spectroscopic measurements now enable detailed
   characterization of sub-Neptune atmospheres, potentially providing
   constraints on their interiors. Motivated by this, atmospheric models
   have been developed to explore chemical interactions between
   hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and possibly underlying magma oceans with
   various redox states. Recent models have predicted monosilane (SiH4) as
   a potential atmospheric species derived from magma oceans in
   sub-Neptunes, but suggested that it is highly depleted in the observable
   atmospheric layers. Here, we propose that SiH4 can persist throughout
   the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes with FeO-free reduced magma oceans by
   considering the dissolution of H2O into the magma oceans, a factor not
   accounted for in previous models. We construct a one-dimensional
   atmospheric model to simulate the chemical equilibrium composition of
   hydrogen-dominated atmospheres overlying FeO-free magma oceans,
   incorporating H-O-Si chemistry. Our results show that the dissolution of
   H2O enhances the SiH4 molar fraction to levels of 0.1\%-10\%, preventing
   it from reverting to silicates in the upper atmospheric layers. We find
   that SiH4-rich atmospheres can exist across a broad parameter space with
   ground temperatures of 2000-6000 K and hydrogen pressures of 102-105
   bar. We discuss that SiH4-rich atmospheres could contain the other
   silanes but lack C-/N-/O-bearing species. The detection of SiH4 in
   future observations of sub-Neptunes would provide compelling evidence
   for the presence of a rocky core with a reduced magma ocean. However,
   the accuracy of our model is limited by the lack of data on the nonideal
   behavior and radiative properties of SiH4, highlighting the need for
   further numerical and laboratory investigations.},

Title = {{Atmospheres as windows into sub-Neptune interiors: coupled chemistry and
   structure of hydrogen-silane-water envelopes}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {524},
Pages = {981-992},
Abstract = {Sub-Neptune exoplanets are commonly hypothesized to consist of a
   silicate-rich magma ocean topped by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. Previous
   work studying the outgassing of silicate material has demonstrated that
   such atmosphere-interior interactions can affect the atmosphere's
   overall structure and extent. However, these models only considered SiO
   in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas, without considering chemical reactions
   between them. Here, we couple calculations of the chemical equilibrium
   between H, Si, and O species with an atmospheric structure model. We
   find that substantial amounts of silane, SiH4, and water, H2O, are
   produced by the interaction between the silicate-rich interior and
   hydrogen-rich atmosphere. These species extend high into the atmosphere,
   though their abundance is greatest at the hottest, deepest regions. For
   example, for a 4 M-\& OPLUS; planet with an equilibrium temperature of
   1000 K, a base temperature of 5000 K, and a 0.1 M-\& OPLUS; hydrogen
   envelope, silicon species and water can comprise 30 per cent of the
   atmosphere by number at the bottom of the atmosphere. Due to this
   abundance enhancement, we find that convection is inhibited at
   temperatures \& GSIM;2500 K. This temperature is lower, implying that
   the resultant non-convective region is thicker, than was found in
   previous models that did not account for atmospheric chemistry. Our
   findings show that significant endogenous water is produced by
   magma-hydrogen interactions alone, without the need to accrete ice-rich
   material. We discuss the observability of the signatures of
   atmosphere-interior interaction and directions for future work,
   including condensate lofting and more complex chemical networks.},

The PES, CBS-F12HL, reproduces all four fundamental term values for 28SiH4 with

cm−1. The PES is based on explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with
extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, and incorporates a range of higher-level
additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron correlation,
higher-order coupled cluster terms, and scalar relativistic effects. Systematic
errors in computed intra-band rotational energy levels are reduced by empirically
refining the equilibrium geometry. The resultant Si–H bond length is in excellent
agreement with previous experimental and theoretical values. Vibrational transition
moments, absolute line intensities of the ν3 band, and the infrared spectrum
for 28SiH4 including states up to J = 20 and vibrational band origins up to 5000

tends to marginally overestimate the strength of line intensities. Despite this,
band shape and structure across the spectrum are well reproduced and show good
agreement with experiment. We thus recommend the PES and DMS for future use},

Abstract = {The introduction of room temperature continuous wave external-cavity

 facilitated high resolution spectroscopy over wide spectral ranges in

 transitions of the stretching dyad of the v(3) fundamental band of

 spectral resolution available has enabled us to resolve and measure
 representative examples of the tetrahedral splittings associated with
 each component of the P-branch. The positions of these components are in
 excellent agreement with spherical top data system (STDS) predictions
 and theoretical transitions from the TDS spectroscopic database for
 spherical top molecules. These are the first measurements of these line
 strengths of (SiH4)-Si-28 and are an example of the applicability of
 high-powered, widely tunable EC-QCLs to high resolution spectroscopy.

Abstract = {Using the University of California Berkeley Infrared Spatial
 Interferometer with a radio frequency (RF) filter bank, the first
 interferometric observations of mid-infrared molecular absorption
 features of ammonia (NH3) and silane (SiH4) with very high spectral
 resolution (lambda/Delta lambda similar to 10(5)) were made. Under the
 assumptions of spherical symmetry and uniform outflow, these new data
 permitted the molecular stratification around carbon star IRC +10216 and
 red supergiant VY CMa to be investigated. For IRC + 10216, both ammonia
 and silane were found to form in the dusty outflow significantly beyond
 both the dust formation and gas acceleration zones. Specifically,
 ammonia was found to form before silane in a region of decaying gas
 turbulence (greater than or equal to 20R({*})), while the silane is
 produced in a region of relatively smooth gas flow much farther from the
 star (greater than or similar to 80R({*})). The depletion of gas-phase
 SiS onto grains soon after dust formation may fuel silane-producing
 reactions on the grain surfaces. For VY CMa, a combination of
 interferometric and spectral observations suggest that NH3, is forming
 near the termination of the gas acceleration phase in a region of high
 gas turbulence (similar to 40R({*})).},

 recorded using the Laboratoire de Physique Moleculaire et Applications

 function width chosen makes it possible to obtain a Doppler-limited
 spectrum. The observed spectrum belongs to the tetrad built with one
 quantum of stretching mode (nu(1) or nu(3)) and one quantum of bending
 mode (nu(2) or nu(4)). The excited states are formed from eight
 vibrational sublevels: nu(1) + nu(2)(E), nu(1) + nu(4)(F-2), nu(2) +
 nu(3)(F-1 + F-2), and nu(3) + nu(4)(A(1) + E + F-1 + F-2). The intricacy
 of the upper states was resolved using the variations of the line
 strength between the 297 K and 209 K spectra and the precise knowledge
 of the ground slate. For analysis with the vibrational extrapolation
 method, we used the previous results for the fundamental bending dyad
 (nu(2)/nu(4)) and the stretching dyad (nu(1)/nu(3)). The Hamiltonian is
 expanded through the sixth order of approximation for the ground and the
 bending states, the fifth order for the stretching states, and the
 fourth order for the tetrad states in the Amat-Nielsen classification.
 About 1033 pieces of data are used in the analysis and the weighted
