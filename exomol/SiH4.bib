	ab initio DMS from coupled cluster CCSD(T) calculations and effective
	DMS where selected higher-order terms in the former were optimized
	by fitting experimental intensities. Both DMS reproduce the intensities
	for transitions below 6500 cm(-1) wen. The effective DMS leads to
	better agreement for higher excitations and reproduces the intensity

  abstract = {Overtones of the Si-H stretching-bending polyad of the SiHD3 molecule
	are studied using an internal coordinate force field model. The potential
	parameters are optimized by fitting to the experimental band centers.
	The Fermi resonance between the Si-H stretching and bending motions
	is insignificant due to cancellation of the contributions from kinetic
	and potential terms. This suggests a slow redistribution of vibrational
	energy between these two degrees of freedom and induces local mode
	character of respective vibrations. Band intensities are calculated
	by using ah initio one- and three-dimensional dipole moment surfaces
	(DMS). These agree reasonably well with the observations. The successful
	reproduction of relative intensities between the (n(1) - 1)v(1) +
	2v(5) stretching-bending combination bands and the n(1)v(1) stretching
	bands establishes the importance of the bending motion in the multidimensional

In this paper, we present a calculation of the vibrational level positions for (CH4)-C-12, (CH4)-C-13, (CD4)-C-12 and (CD4)-C-13 performed using the effective Hamiltonian parameters obtained through recent analyses. We also include the results of a re-analysis of the octad system of (CH4)-C-12 performed with a higher order of the development which slightly improves the previous work on this polyad.

 representative examples of the tetrahedral splittings associated with

 excellent agreement with spherical top data system (STDS) predictions

 rotational excitation up to J = 39. The line list is computed using the
 eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of CH4 obtained by variational solution
 of the Schrodinger equation for the rotation-vibration motion of nuclei
 employing program trove and a new `spectroscopic' potential energy
 surface (PES) obtained by refining an ab initio PES
 (CCSD(T)-F12c/aug-cc-pVQZ) through least-squares fitting to the
 experimentally derived energies with J = 0-4 and a previously reported
 ab initio dipole moment surface (CCSD(T)-F12c/aug-cc-pVTZ). Detailed
 comparisons with other available sources of methane transitions
 including HITRAN, experimental compilations and other theoretical line
 lists show that these sources lack transitions both higher temperatures
 and near-infrared wavelengths. The 10to10 line list is suitable for
 modelling atmospheres of cool stars and exoplanets. It is available from

 is calculated with the customary normal mode model including
 Darling-Dennison resonances. The calculated and observed constants are

 local mode vibrations in real molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {A new nine-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment
 surface (DMS) for silane have been generated using high-level ab initio
 theory. The PES, CBS-F12(HL), reproduces all four fundamental term
 values for (SiH4)-Si-28 with sub-wavenumber accuracy, resulting in an
 overall root-mean-square error of 0.63 cm(-1). The PES is based on
 explicitly correlated coupled cluster calculations with extrapolation to
 the complete basis set limit, and incorporates a range of higher-level
 additive energy corrections to account for core-valence electron
 correlation, higher-order coupled cluster terms, and scalar relativistic
 effects. Systematic errors in computed intra-band rotational energy
 levels are reduced by empirically refining the equilibrium geometry. The
 resultant Si-H bond length is in excellent agreement with previous
 experimental and theoretical values. Vibrational transition moments,
 absolute line intensities of the nu(3) band, and the infrared spectrum
 for (SiH4)-Si-28 including states up to J = 20 and vibrational band
 origins up to 5000 cm(-1) are calculated and compared with available
 experimental results. The DMS tends to marginally overestimate the
 strength of line intensities. Despite this, band shape and structure
 across the spectrum are well reproduced and show good agreement with
 experiment. We thus recommend the PES and DMS for future use. (C) 2015

  Abstract                 = {Using the University of California Berkeley Infrared Spatial
 Interferometer with a radio frequency (RF) filter bank, the first
 interferometric observations of mid-infrared molecular absorption
 features of ammonia (NH3) and silane (SiH4) with very high spectral
 resolution (lambda/Delta lambda similar to 10(5)) were made. Under the
 assumptions of spherical symmetry and uniform outflow, these new data
 permitted the molecular stratification around carbon star IRC +10216 and
 red supergiant VY CMa to be investigated. For IRC + 10216, both ammonia
 and silane were found to form in the dusty outflow significantly beyond
 both the dust formation and gas acceleration zones. Specifically,
 ammonia was found to form before silane in a region of decaying gas
 turbulence (greater than or equal to 20R({*})), while the silane is
 produced in a region of relatively smooth gas flow much farther from the
 star (greater than or similar to 80R({*})). The depletion of gas-phase
 SiS onto grains soon after dust formation may fuel silane-producing
 reactions on the grain surfaces. For VY CMa, a combination of
 interferometric and spectral observations suggest that NH3, is forming
 near the termination of the gas acceleration phase in a region of high
 gas turbulence (similar to 40R({*})).},

 produced in the region 10 to 40 R{*}, possibly by formation on grains.
 CS is very strongly depleted in the region 100-1000 R{*}, perhaps onto
 grains. From nondetection of H-2 the current mass-loss rate is
 constrained to be less than 4 x 10(-5) M. yr-1. Gathering evidence for a
 recent decline in the mass-loss rate is strengthened by analysis of the
 low-excitation heterodyne NH3 line observation, which indicates that the
 mass-loss rate may have been 2-3 x larger 1000 yr ago (material
 currently near 700 R{*}).},
