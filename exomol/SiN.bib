abstract = {Despite decades of diligent work on their development, line-by-line
(LBL) spectroscopic information systems, widely employed by scientists
and engineers, may still contain a number of incorrect rovibronic
lines. A novel heuristic protocol, relying on cycle bases of
spectroscopic networks (SN) and a system of linear constraints, is
proposed to unravel incorrect transitions present in the database. The
algorithm is named autoECART, standing for automatic Energy
Conservation Analysis of Rovibronic Transitions. The autoECART method
is tested on synthetic SNs constructed from spectroscopic databases of
nine water isotopologues. The systematic numerical tests demonstrate
the outstanding capability of the autoECART procedure to identify
almost all of the outliers generated randomly in these synthetic SNs.
As a `real-life' example, the GEISA-2019-H218O database is
scrutinized, revealing 17 rough outlier lines. Developers of
spectroscopic information systems are encouraged to utilize autoECART
for cleansing the huge number of transitions deposited in LBL
databases.},

to be the same with nanopatterns on the polymer. The contact
imprinting master can be used continually for the generation of
nanopore patterns simply and easily. It can endure harsh conditions

close to that of cobalt chromium (200GPa). Furthermore, all except one
of the SixNy coatings offered a wear resistance similar to that of

abstract = {The positive correlation between planet detection rate and host star
iron abundance lends strong support to the core accretion theory of
planet formation. However, iron is not the most significant mass
contributor to the cores of giant planets. Since giant planet cores
are thought to grow from silicate grains with icy mantles, the
likelihood of gas giant formation should depend heavily on the oxygen
and silicon abundance of the planet formation environment. Here we
compare the silicon and oxygen abundances of a set of 76 planet hosts
and a control sample of 80 metal-rich stars without any known giant
planets. Our new, independent analysis was conducted using high
resolution, high signal-to-noise data obtained at McDonald
Observatory. Because we do not wish to simply reproduce the known
planettextendash metallicity correlation, we have devised a
statistical method for matching the underlying [Fe/H] distributions of
our two sets of stars. We find a 99% probability that planet detection
rate depends on the silicon abundance of the host star, over and above
the observed planettextendash metallicity correlation. We do not
detect any such correlation for oxygen. Our results would thus seem to
suggest that grain nucleation, rather than subsequent icy mantle
growth, is the important limiting factor in forming giant planets via
core accretion. Based on our results and interpretation, we predict
that planet detection should correlate with host star abundance for
refractory elements responsible for grain nucleation and that no such
trends should exist for the most abundant volatile elements
responsible for icy mantle growth.},

abstract = {Single- and multiple-nanopore membranes are both highly interesting
for biosensing and separation processes, as well as their ability to
mimic biological membranes. The density of pores, their shape, and
their surface chemistry are the key factors that determine membrane
transport and separation capabilities. Here, we report silicon nitride
(SiN) membranes with fully controlled porosity, pore geometry, and
pore surface chemistry. An ultrathin freestanding SiN platform is
described with conical or double-conical nanopores of diameters as
small as several nanometers, prepared by the track-etching technique.
This technique allows the membrane porosity to be tuned from one to
billions of pores per square centimeter. We demonstrate the separation
capabilities of these membranes by discrimination of dye and protein
molecules based on their charge and size. This separation process is
based on an electrostatic mechanism and operates in physiological
electrolyte conditions. As we have also shown, the separation
capabilities can be tuned by chemically modifying the pore walls.
Compared with typical membranes with cylindrical pores, the conical
and double-conical pores reported here allow for higher fluxes, a
critical advantage in separation applications. In addition, the
conical pore shape results in a shorter effective length, which gives
advantages for single biomolecule detection applications such as
nanopore-based DNA analysis.},

multiple-bond character. Si-rich clusters favor planar or three-

@article{95McSuxx.SiN,
abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three
main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its
interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar
nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of
peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of
compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these
methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and
geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle
of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5% and 15% of a
low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI
carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the
refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances
of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite
chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average
CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and
from the refractory element compositions of different groups of
chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element
compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements.
These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the
composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major
and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to
constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile
peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be
accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here
avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models,
and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition
having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at
{$sim$} 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios
in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used
to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory
elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the
accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the
Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible
exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record
(the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly
constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy).
Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used
to suggest the presence ({$sim$} 10 {$pm$} 5%) of a light element or a
combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core
is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The
limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the
light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the
class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models
of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk FeAl of {$sim$}
20 {$pm$} 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is
stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned
between the Silicate Earth ({$sim$} 14%) and the core ({$sim$} 86%).
Chondritic meteorites display a range of FeAl ratios, with many having
a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth
and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences,
with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile
elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition
matching that of the Earth's.},
