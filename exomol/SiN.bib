Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of X-2 Sigma(+), A(2)Pi and B-2
   Sigma(+) low-lying electronic states of SiN radical are investigated
   using the highly accurate valence internally contracted multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) approach combining the full valence
   complete active space self-consistent field method. In the present
   calculations, the basis sets used are correlation-consistent basis sets,
   aug-cc-pV6Z. The PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are corrected
   for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson modification (MRCI
   +Q). To obtain more reliable results, effects of the core-valence
   correlation and relativistic correction on the PEC are taken into
   account. The core-valence correlation correction is carried out with the
   cc-pCV5Z basis set. The way to consider the relativistic correction is
   to use the second-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation, and the
   correction is performed at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. With these
   PECs, the spectroscopic parameters are determined. A comparison with the
   experimental data shows that the present spectroscopic parameters are
   more accurate than the previous calculations.},
