Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of X-2 Sigma(+), A(2)Pi and B-2
   Sigma(+) low-lying electronic states of SiN radical are investigated
   using the highly accurate valence internally contracted multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) approach combining the full valence
   complete active space self-consistent field method. In the present
   calculations, the basis sets used are correlation-consistent basis sets,
   aug-cc-pV6Z. The PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are corrected
   for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson modification (MRCI
   +Q). To obtain more reliable results, effects of the core-valence
   correlation and relativistic correction on the PEC are taken into
   account. The core-valence correlation correction is carried out with the
   cc-pCV5Z basis set. The way to consider the relativistic correction is
   to use the second-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation, and the
   correction is performed at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. With these
   PECs, the spectroscopic parameters are determined. A comparison with the
   experimental data shows that the present spectroscopic parameters are
   more accurate than the previous calculations.},

Abstract = {{Theoretical studies, using the multireference correlation consistent
   composite approach (MR-ccCA), have been carried out on the ground and
   lowest lying spin-forbidden excited states of a series of
   silicon-containing systems. The MR-ccCA method is the multireference
   equivalent of the successful single reference ccCA method that has been
   shown to produce chemically accurate (within +/- 1.0 kcal mol(-1) of
   reliable, well-established experiment) results. The percentage
   contributions of the SCF configurations to complete active space
   self-consistent field wave functions together with the Frobenius norm of
   the t(1) vectors and related D-1 diagnostics of the coupled-cluster
   single double wave function with the cc-pVTZ basis set have been
   utilized to illustrate the multi-configurational characteristics of the
   compounds considered. MR-ccCA incorporates additive terms to account for
   relativistic effects, atomic spin-orbit coupling, scalar relativistic
   effects, and core-valence correlation. MR-ccCA has been utilized to
   predict the atomization energies, enthalpies of formation, and the
   lowest energy spin-forbidden transitions for SinXm (2 <= n + m = 3 where
   n not equal 0 and X = B, C, N, Al, P), silicon hydrides, and analogous

Abstract = {{We present a detailed study of the structures and energetics of SinNm

   lowest-energy isomers of these clusters as a function of total cluster
   size and cluster stoichiometry. The properties of the low-energy isomers
   were calculated using an accurate, all-electron full-potential
   density-functional method at both the local density approximation (LDA)
   and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) levels of theory. We
   found the most stable clusters by conducting an extensive phase space
   exploration for all the clusters containing up to 6 atoms, checking all
   bonding topologies and all possible atom type decorations. The search
   was done using a fast, but accurate, density-functional based
   tight-binding method. The calculations reveal several trends in the
   silicon-nitrogen binary cluster system. For N-rich clusters, linear or
   quasi-linear structures predominate, with strong multiple-bond
   character. Si-rich clusters favor planar or three-dimensional
   structures. Near the n=m stoichiometry the lowest energy isomers feature
   a strong alternation of Si and N atoms. Pairing of nitrogen atoms is
   unfavourable as is strong isolation of nitrogens. We use the results of
   the calculations to discuss possible growth pathways for the clusters.

abstract = {Finite-difference Hartree-Fock calculations are reported on the ground states of SiC, SiN, Si2, and SiS as well as on the first excited state of Si2. For all species a number of points on their respective potential energy curve are reported along with selected one-electron properties at these points. Spectroscopic properties are evaluated from the potential curves and compared to previous theoretical and, where available, experimental results. Basis-set effects in previous calculations on the electric and spectroscopic properties of these molecules and on energy differences between different electronic states are discussed.}

A complete rotational analysis has been performed on the 4-3 and 3-3 bands and one subband of the 2-2 band has been analyzed. The transition has been shown to be D2Π-A2Π, with either both states inverted or both states regular. Accurate “true” rotational constants (in cm−1) have been obtained as follows for the 4-3 band. B4′= 0.50576±0.00051, D4′ = (1.08±0.46) × 10−6, B3″= 0.65647±0.00054, D3″ = (1.02±0.52) × 10−6. The following spin-orbit coupling constants were obtained (in cm−1). A4′= − 45.14±0.96, A3″ = −72.18±0.96) (if inverted states) or A4′= 47.18±0.97, A3″ = −74.82±0.95) (if regular states) Perturbations in the upper level of the 3-3 band have been observed, and an approximate analysis has shown them to be caused by a 2Σ state with B = 0.61 ± 0.02.}

abstract = { A new spectrum of SiO+ in the region 4300–4100 Å has been obtained by a r-f. discharge through a flowing mixture of argon and SiCl4 which contained a trace of oxygen. This spectrum is mainly a long sequence Δν = 0. The rotational structure of the three bands 0–0, 1–1, and 2–2 has been analyzed and the rotational constants of the upper and lower states are determined.The known spectrum of SiO+ in the region around 3840 Å (Woods 1943) has also been obtained, with improved intensity under the above conditions and has been reanalyzed. It is found that the earlier numbering of the lines of this system is wrong by one unit and that the lower state of these bands and the upper state of the new bands represent the same state. The weak band, which was analyzed by Woods as 1–1, appears to fit as 2–2 according to the new analysis.Rotational constants of the three 2Σ states, which are named X, A, and B, are shown below (in cm−1):A discussion on electron configurations has also been included. }
