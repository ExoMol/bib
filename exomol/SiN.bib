complete active space self-consistent field method. In the present
calculations, the basis sets used are correlation-consistent basis

corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson
modification (MRCI +Q). To obtain more reliable results, effects of
the core-valence correlation and relativistic correction on the PEC
are taken into account. The core-valence correlation correction is
carried out with the cc-pCV5Z basis set. The way to consider the
relativistic correction is to use the second-order Douglas-Kroll
Hamiltonian approximation, and the correction is performed at the
level of cc-pV5Z basis set. With these PECs, the spectroscopic
parameters are determined. A comparison with the experimental data
shows that the present spectroscopic parameters are more accurate than
the previous calculations.},

clusters with n+m less than or equal to 6. We have determined the
lowest-energy isomers of these clusters as a function of total cluster
size and cluster stoichiometry. The properties of the low-energy
isomers were calculated using an accurate, all-electron full-potential
density-functional method at both the local density approximation
(LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) levels of
theory. We found the most stable clusters by conducting an extensive
phase space exploration for all the clusters containing up to 6 atoms,
checking all bonding topologies and all possible atom type
decorations. The search was done using a fast, but accurate, density-
functional based tight-binding method. The calculations reveal several
trends in the silicon-nitrogen binary cluster system. For N-rich
clusters, linear or quasi-linear structures predominate, with strong
multiple-bond character. Si-rich clusters favor planar or three-
dimensional structures. Near the n=m stoichiometry the lowest energy
isomers feature a strong alternation of Si and N atoms. Pairing of
nitrogen atoms is unfavourable as is strong isolation of nitrogens. We
use the results of the calculations to discuss possible growth
pathways for the clusters. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {Three bands of the very weak Mulliken system of SiN, excited in an
afterglow source, have been photographed at high resolution. A
complete rotational analysis has been performed on the 4-3 and 3-3
bands and one subband of the 2-2 band has been analyzed. The
transition has been shown to be D2-A2, with either both states
inverted or both states regular. Accurate true rotational constants
(in cm1) have been obtained as follows for the 4-3 band. B4=
0.505760.00051, D4 = (1.080.46)  106, B3= 0.656470.00054, D3 =
(1.020.52)  106. The following spin-orbit coupling constants were
obtained (in cm1). A4=  45.140.96, A3 = 72.180.96) (if inverted
states) or A4= 47.180.97, A3 = 74.820.95) (if regular states)
Perturbations in the upper level of the 3-3 band have been observed,
and an approximate analysis has shown them to be caused by a 2 state
with B = 0.61  0.02.},

abstract = { A new spectrum of SiO+ in the region 43004100 has been obtained by a
r-f. discharge through a flowing mixture of argon and SiCl4 which
contained a trace of oxygen. This spectrum is mainly a long sequence
=0. The rotational structure of the three bands 00, 11, and 22 has
been analyzed and the rotational constants of the upper and lower
states are determined.The known spectrum of SiO+ in the region around
3840 (Woods 1943) has also been obtained, with improved intensity
under the above conditions and has been reanalyzed. It is found that
the earlier numbering of the lines of this system is wrong by one unit
and that the lower state of these bands and the upper state of the new
bands represent the same state. The weak band, which was analyzed by
Woods as 11, appears to fit as 22 according to the new
analysis.Rotational constants of the three 2 states, which are named
X, A, and B, are shown below (in cm1):A discussion on electron
configurations has also been included.},
