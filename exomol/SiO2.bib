Title = {Observability of evaporating lava worlds star},

Abstract = {Lava worlds belong to a class of short orbital period planets reaching
   dayside temperatures high enough to melt their silicate crust. Theory
   predicts that the resulting lava oceans outgas their volatile
   components, attaining equilibrium with the overlying vapour. This
   creates a tenuous, silicate-rich atmosphere that may be confined to the
   permanent dayside of the planet. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
   will provide the much needed sensitivity and spectral coverage to
   characterise these worlds. In this paper, we assess the observability of
   characterisable spectral features by self-consistently modelling
   silicate atmospheres for all the currently confirmed targets having
   sufficient -stellar temperatures (>1500 K). To achieve this we used
   outgassed equilibrium chemistry and radiative transfer methods to
   compute temperature-pressure profiles, atmospheric chemical
   compositions, and emission spectra. We explore varying melt
   compositions, free of highly volatile elements, accounting for possible
   atmospheric evolution. Our models include a large number of neutral and
   ionic species, as well as all up-to-date opacities. The results indicate
   that SiO and SiO2 infrared features are the best unique identifiers of
   silicate atmospheres, which are detectable using the MIRI instrument of
   JWST. Detection of these two species in emission would allow for strong
   constraints on the atmospheric thermal structure and possibly the
   composition of the melt. We also propose that certain species, for
   example TiO, may be directly tied to different classes of melts,
   possibly revealing surface and interior dynamics. Currently, there are
   nearly a dozen confirmed lava planets ideal for characterisation of
   silicate atmospheres using JWST, with two of these already accepted for
   the initial General Observers programme.},
