Title = {{Spectroscopy and molecule opacity investigation on excited states of SiS}},
Journal = {CHINESE PHYSICS B},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Abstract = {The SiS molecule, which plays a significant role in space, has attracted
   a great deal of attention for many years. Due to complex interactions
   among its low-lying electronic states, precise information regarding the
   molecular structure of SiS is limited. To obtain accurate information
   about the structure of its excited states, the high-precision
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) method has been
   utilized. This method is used to calculate the potential energy curves
   (PECs) of the 18 Lambda-S states corresponding to the lowest
   dissociation limit of SiS. The core-valence correlation effect,
   Davidson's correction and the scalar relativistic effect are also
   included to guarantee the precision of the MRCI calculation. Based on
   the calculated PECs, the spectroscopic constants of quasi-bound and
   bound electronic states are calculated and they are in accordance with
   previous experimental results. The transition dipole moments (TDMs) and
   dipole moments (DMs) are determined by the MRCI method. In addition, the
   abrupt variations of the DMs for the 15 Sigma+ and 25 Sigma+ states at
   the avoided crossing point are attributed to the variation of the
   electronic configuration. The opacity of SiS at a pressure of 100 atms
   is presented across a series of temperatures. With increasing
   temperature, the expanding population of excited states blurs the band
   boundaries.},

title = {{Sulphur-bearing molecules in AGB stars I. The occurrence of hydrogen sulphide}},
journal = AA,
year = {2017},
volume = 606,
pages = {A124},
abstract = {Sulphur is a relatively abundant element in the local Galaxy that is
known to form a variety of molecules in the circumstellar envelopes of AGB stars.
he abundances of these molecules vary based on the chemical types and mass-loss
rates of AGB stars. Aims. Through a survey of (sub-)millimetre emission lines of
various sulphur-bearing molecules, we aim to determine which molecules are the
primary carriers of sulphur in different types of AGB stars. In this paper, the
first in a series, we investigate the occurrence of H2S in AGB circumstellar envelopes
and determine its abundance, where possible. Methods. We surveyed 20 AGB stars
with a range of mass-loss rates and different chemical types using the Atacama
Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope to search for rotational transition lines
of five key sulphur-bearing molecules: CS, SiS, SO, SO2, and H2S. Here we present
our results for H2S, including detections, non-detections, and detailed radiative
transfer modelling of the detected lines. We compared results based on various
descriptions of the molecular excitation of H2S and different abundance distributions,
including Gaussian abundances, where possible, and two different abundance distributions
derived from chemical modelling results. Results. We detected H2S towards five AGB
stars, all of which have high mass-loss rates of Ṁ ≥ 5 × 10-6 M⊙ yr-1 and are oxygen
rich. H2S was not detected towards the carbon or S-type stars that fall in a similar
mass-loss range. For the stars in our sample with detections, we find peak o-H2S
abundances relative to H2 between 4 × 10-7 and 2.5 × 10-5. Conclusions. Overall,
we conclude that H2S can play a significant role in oxygen-rich AGB stars with
higher mass-loss rates, but is unlikely to play a key role in stars of other chemical
types or in lower mass-loss rate oxygen-rich stars. For two sources, V1300 Aql and
GX Mon, H2S is most likely the dominant sulphur-bearing molecule in the circumstellar envelope.},

Abstract = {We report the detection of SiS rotational lines in high-vibrational
   states as well as SiO and SiC2 lines in their ground vibrational state
   toward IRC+10216 during the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Cycle 0. The
   spatial distribution of these molecules shows compact emission for SiS
   and a more extended emission for SiO and SiC2 and also proves the
   existence of an increase in the SiC2 emission at the outer shells of the
   circumstellar envelope (CSE). We analyze the excitation conditions of
   the vibrationally excited SiS using the population diagram technique,
   and we use a large velocity gradient model to compare with the
   observations. We found moderate discrepancies between the observations
   and the models that could be explained if SiS lines detected are
   optically thick. Additionally, the line profiles of the detected
   rotational lines in the high-energy vibrational states show a decreasing
   linewidth with increasing energy levels. This may be evidence that these
   lines could be excited only in the inner shells, i.e., the densest and
   hottest, of the CSE of IRC+10216.},

   Echelon-cross-Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the NASA Infrared

   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32, 26 of (SiS)-Si-29-S-32, 20 of (SiS)-Si-28-S-34, and 15
   of (SiS)-Si-30-S-32 in the frequency range 720-790 cm(-1). These lines
   belong to bands v = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4, and involve rotational
   levels with J(low) less than or similar to 90. About 30 per cent of
   these lines are unblended or weakly blended and can be partially or
   entirely fitted with a code developed to model the mid-IR emission of a
   spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope composed of expanding gas
   and dust. The observed lines trace the envelope at distances to the star
   less than or similar to 35R(star) (similar or equal to 0.7 arcsec). The
   fits are compatible with an expansion velocity of 1 + 2.5(r/R-star-1) km
   s(-1) between 1 and 5R(star), 11km s(-1) between 5 and 20R(star), and
   14.5 km s(-1) outwards. The derived abundance profile of
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 with respect to H-2 is 4.9 x 10(-6) between the stellar
   photosphere and 5R(star), decreasing linearly down to 1.6 x 10(-6) at
   20R(star) and to 1.3 x 10(-6) at 50R(star). (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 seems to be
   rotationally under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the region
   of the envelope probed with our observations and vibrationally out of
   LTE in most of it. There is a red-shifted emission excess in the
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 lines of band v = 1-0 that cannot be found in the lines
   of bands v = 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4. This excess could be explained by
   an enhancement of the vibrational temperature around 20R(star) behind
   the star. The derived isotopic ratios Si-28/Si-29, and S-32/S-34 are 17
   and 14, compatible with previous estimates.},

   on the PECs by the relativistic correction is taken into account. The

   correction is made at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. To obtain more
   reliable results, the PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are also
   corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson

   these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, D-e, R-e, omega(e)x(e),
   omega Y-e(e), B-e and alpha(e)) are determined and compared with those
   reported in the literature. With the PECs obtained by the MRCI+Q/DK+56
   calculations, the vibrational levels and inertial rotation and
   centrifugal distortion constants of the first 30 vibrational states are
   calculated for each electronic state involved here when the rotational
   quantum number J is equal to zero. Comparison with the measurements
   shows that the present total-energy extrapolation could improve the
   quality of spectroscopic parameters. On the whole, as expected, the
   spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants closest to the
   experimental data are determined by the MRCI+QJDK+56 calculations for
   these electronic states.},

pages = {871-882},
abstract = {Aims.Given their photospheric origin and refractive nature, SiS molecules
can provide major constraints on the relative roles of dust condensation and non-equilibrium
processes in regulating the chemistry in circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars.
Methods.New SiS multi-transition (sub-)millimetre line observations of a sample
of AGB stars with varying photospheric C/O-ratios and mass-loss rates are presented.
A combination of low- and high-energy lines are important in constraining the
circumstellar distribution of SiS molecules. A detailed radiative transfer modelling
of the observed SiS line emission is performed, including assessment of the effect
of thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis. Results.We find that the circumstellar
fractional abundance of SiS in these environments has a strong dependence on the
photospheric C/O-ratio as expected from chemical models. The carbon stars (C/O > 1)
have a mean fractional abundance of 3.1  10-6, about one order of magnitude higher
than that found for the M-type AGB stars (C/O < 1) where the mean value is 2.7  10-7.
These numbers are in reasonable agreement with photospheric LTE chemical models.
SiS appears to behave similarly to SiO in terms of photodissociation in the outer
part of the circumstellar envelope. In contrast to previous results for the related
molecule SiO, there is no strong correlation of the fractional abundance with density
in the CSE, as would be the case if freeze-out onto dust grains were important.
However, possible time-variability of the line emission in the lower J transitions
and the sensitivity of the line emission to abundance gradients in the inner part
of the CSE may mask a correlation with the density of the wind. There are indications
that the SiS fractional abundance could be significantly higher closer to the star
which, at least in the case of M-type AGB stars, would require non-equilibrium chemical
processes.},

Title = {{Rotational spectroscopy of the isotopic species of silicon monosulfide,

Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {1579-1586},
abstract = {Pure rotational transitions of silicon monosulfide (28Si32S) and its
rare isotopic species have been observed in their ground as well as vibrationally
excited states by employing Fourier transform microwave (FTMW) spectroscopy of a
supersonic molecular beam at centimetre wavelengths (13–37 GHz) and by using long-path
absorption spectroscopy at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths (127–925 GHz).
The latter measurements include 91 transition frequencies for 28Si32S, 28Si33S,
28Si34S, 29Si32S and 30Si32S in υ = 0, as well as 5 lines for 28Si32S in υ = 1,
with rotational quantum numbers J″ ≤ 52. The centimetre-wave measurements include
more than 300 newly recorded lines. Together with previous data they result in
almost 600 transitions (J″ = 0 and 1) from all twelve possible isotopic species,
including 29Si36S and 30Si36S, which have fractional abundances of about 7 × 10−6
and 4.5 × 10−6, respectively. Rotational transitions were observed from υ = 0 for
the least abundant isotopic species to as high as υ = 51 for the main species.
Owing to the high spectral resolution of the FTMW spectrometer, hyperfine structure
from the nuclear electric quadrupole moment of 33S was resolved for species containing
this isotope, as was much smaller nuclear spin-rotation splitting for isotopic species
involving 29Si. By combining the measurements here with previously published microwave
and infrared data in one global fit, an improved set of spectroscopic parameters
for SiS has been derived which include several terms describing the breakdown of
the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. With this parameter set, highly accurate rotational
frequencies for this important astronomical molecule can now be predicted well into
the terahertz region.},

   lines of SiS and mid-IR lines of C2H2, HCN, and their C-13
   isotopologues. The large number of overlaps found suggest the existence
   of strong masers for high-J upsilon = 0 and upsilon = 1 SiS transitions,

Journal = AA,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {426},
Pages = {219-227},
Abstract = {The J = 2-1 and 3-2 rotational lines of the rare isotopomer C(36)S and
   the J = 5-4 and 6-5 transitions of Si(36)S were detected in the carbon
   star IRC+10216 (CWLeo). These are the first detections of (36)S-bearing
   molecules in a star and the first spectroscopic detection of Si(36)S.
   From a comparison of (34)S- and (36)S-bearing isotopomers, the
   (34)S/(36)S isotopic ratio is 107(+/-15). This value is comparable to
   values in the interstellar medium of the inner Galactic disk (115) but
   is smaller than the solar value of 288 (Ding et al. 2001). The increase
   of the (36)S abundance relative to (34)S only qualitatively follows
   model predictions of a low mass AGB star. Quantitative agreement of the
   observed (34)S/(36)S ratio with the stellar models can be reached if the
   age of IRC+10216 and Galactic chemical evolution are taken into account.
   Other less likely possibilities are the presence of considerable
   inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium and either IRC+10216 or the
   Sun started with a peculiar (36)S abundance. Other production mechanisms
   potentially capable of enhancing the Galactic interstellar medium are
   discussed. From the observed line density toward IRC+10216 and toward
   Galactic star forming regions, we estimate the confusion limit toward
   those sources.},

   molecular species identified in the mm-wave spectrum of IRC+10216 were

   containing rare isotopes of C, Mg, Si, S and Cl, whose elemental
   abundance ratios in the envelope are redetermined. We observe, in
   particular, four (13)C isotopomers of C(4)H, three of C(3)N and HC(3)N,
   and four doubly-substituted isotopomers of SiS and CS.
   63 lines remain unidentified. Probably, a large fraction of those are

Abstract = {We report the first observations of the 13.5 mu m fundamental band of
   SiS in the spectrum of the heavily obscured carbon star IRC +10216. The
   lines are formed in the inner region of the circumstellar envelope where
   the gas is accelerating and where the temperature ranges from 800-500 K.
   We have carried out a detailed model of the observed line profiles. Our
   observations are best fit by a gradient in the abundance of SiS. We
   derive an abundance relative to molecular hydrogen of x(SiS) = 4.3 x
   10(-6) ata distance of twelve stellar radii from the central star rising
   to x(SiS)= 4.3 x 10(-5) at a few Stellar radii from the surface of the star.},

   equilibrium position. Near Hartree-Fock accuracy is obtained in the SCF
   calculations. All eight molecules have a range of internuclear distance
   in which electric dipole moments are of the polarity of A-B+. The shapes
   of computed electric dipole moment functions are discussed in the
   language of the molecular orbital method and in relationship to
   electronegativities of atoms. The present study gives us deeper

abstract = {A new ultra-violet band-system, E-X, of each of the molecules SiS,
SiSe and SiTe has been observed in absorption at 800-1000° C., and vibrational
analyses have been done. The D-X systems, already known in emission, have also
been photographed in absorption. These observations have extended the D-X systems
of SiSe and of SiTe and have led to somewhat improved values of the vibrational
constants. The results are summarized in the following table},

Title = {{The band spectrum of silicon monosulphide and its relation to the band
   spectra of similar molecules}},
Journal = {Proc. Roy Soc. A},
Year = {1938},
Volume = {169},
Pages = {45-65},
abstract = {In a recent paper (Jevons, Bashford and Briscoe 1937) on the ultraviolet
band system of GeO, a survey was made of the band systems of the monoxides and
monosulphides of the Group-IV(B) elements which appeared to be analogous to
the “Fourth Positive” system (A 1II -> x 1Σ) of CO and the well-known ultra-violet
systems of CS and SiO It was found that when the observed values of the vibrational
coefficients we and xewe were plotted against the number of electrons in the molecule
two pairs of uninflected curves were obtained for the lower states of the monoxides
and monosulphides, these states being probably all 1Σ ground states, and two similar
pairs of curves were obtained for the upper states.},
