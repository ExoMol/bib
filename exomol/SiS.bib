   Sigma(-), D-1 Delta and A(1)Pi) of SiS molecule were investigated with
   the full valence complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)
   method followed by the highly accurate valence internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach with the
   correlation-consistent basis sets, aug-cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV6Z. Effect
   on the PECs by the relativistic correction is taken into account. The
   way to consider the relativistic correction is to use the second-order
   Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian (DKH2) approximation. And the relativistic
   correction is made at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. To obtain more
   reliable results, the PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are also
   corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson
   modification (MRCI+Q). The PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis
   set (CBS) limit by the two-point total-energy extrapolation scheme. With
   these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, D-e, R-e, omega(e)x(e),
   omega Y-e(e), B-e and alpha(e)) are determined and compared with those
   reported in the literature. With the PECs obtained by the MRCI+Q/DK+56
   calculations, the vibrational levels and inertial rotation and
   centrifugal distortion constants of the first 30 vibrational states are
   calculated for each electronic state involved here when the rotational
   quantum number J is equal to zero. Comparison with the measurements
   shows that the present total-energy extrapolation could improve the
   quality of spectroscopic parameters. On the whole, as expected, the
   spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants closest to the
   experimental data are determined by the MRCI+QJDK+56 calculations for
   these electronic states.},

   Echelon-cross-Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the NASA Infrared
   Telescope Facility. We have identified 204 ro-vibrational lines of
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32, 26 of (SiS)-Si-29-S-32, 20 of (SiS)-Si-28-S-34, and 15
   of (SiS)-Si-30-S-32 in the frequency range 720-790 cm(-1). These lines
   belong to bands v = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4, and involve rotational
   levels with J(low) less than or similar to 90. About 30 per cent of
   these lines are unblended or weakly blended and can be partially or
   entirely fitted with a code developed to model the mid-IR emission of a
   spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope composed of expanding gas
   and dust. The observed lines trace the envelope at distances to the star
   less than or similar to 35R(star) (similar or equal to 0.7 arcsec). The
   fits are compatible with an expansion velocity of 1 + 2.5(r/R-star-1) km
   s(-1) between 1 and 5R(star), 11km s(-1) between 5 and 20R(star), and
   14.5 km s(-1) outwards. The derived abundance profile of
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 with respect to H-2 is 4.9 x 10(-6) between the stellar
   photosphere and 5R(star), decreasing linearly down to 1.6 x 10(-6) at
   20R(star) and to 1.3 x 10(-6) at 50R(star). (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 seems to be
   rotationally under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the region
   of the envelope probed with our observations and vibrationally out of
   LTE in most of it. There is a red-shifted emission excess in the
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 lines of band v = 1-0 that cannot be found in the lines
   of bands v = 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4. This excess could be explained by
   an enhancement of the vibrational temperature around 20R(star) behind
   the star. The derived isotopic ratios Si-28/Si-29, and S-32/S-34 are 17
   and 14, compatible with previous estimates.}},

Year = {{2007}},

Pages = {871-882},
Abstract = {{Aims. Given their photospheric origin and refractive nature, SiS
   molecules can provide major constraints on the relative roles of dust
   condensation and non-equilibrium processes in regulating the chemistry
   in circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars.
   Methods. New SiS multi-transition (sub-) millimetre line observations of
   a sample of AGB stars with varying photospheric C/O-ratios and mass-loss
   rates are presented. A combination of low- and high-energy lines are
   important in constraining the circumstellar distribution of SiS
   molecules. A detailed radiative transfer modelling of the observed SiS
   line emission is performed, including assessment of the effect of
   thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis.
   Results. We find that the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiS in
   these environments has a strong dependence on the photospheric C/O-ratio
   as expected from chemical models. The carbon stars (C/O > 1) have a mean
   fractional abundance of 3.1 x 10(-6), about one order of magnitude
   higher than that found for the M-type AGB stars (C/O < 1) where the mean
   value is 2.7 x 10(-7). These numbers are in reasonable agreement with
   photospheric LTE chemical models. SiS appears to behave similarly to SiO
   in terms of photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar
   envelope. In contrast to previous results for the related molecule SiO,
   there is no strong correlation of the fractional abundance with density
   in the CSE, as would be the case if freeze-out onto dust grains were
   important. However, possible time-variability of the line emission in
   the lower J transitions and the sensitivity of the line emission to
   abundance gradients in the inner part of the CSE may mask a correlation
   with the density of the wind. There are indications that the SiS
   fractional abundance could be significantly higher closer to the star
   which, at least in the case of M-type AGB stars, would require
   non-equilibrium chemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{The J = 2-1 and 3-2 rotational lines of the rare isotopomer C(36)S and

   star IRC+10216 (CWLeo). These are the first detections of (36)S-bearing
   molecules in a star and the first spectroscopic detection of Si(36)S.
   From a comparison of (34)S- and (36)S-bearing isotopomers, the
   (34)S/(36)S isotopic ratio is 107(+/-15). This value is comparable to
   values in the interstellar medium of the inner Galactic disk (115) but
   is smaller than the solar value of 288 (Ding et al. 2001). The increase
   of the (36)S abundance relative to (34)S only qualitatively follows
   model predictions of a low mass AGB star. Quantitative agreement of the
   observed (34)S/(36)S ratio with the stellar models can be reached if the
   age of IRC+10216 and Galactic chemical evolution are taken into account.
   Other less likely possibilities are the presence of considerable
   inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium and either IRC+10216 or the
   Sun started with a peculiar (36)S abundance. Other production mechanisms
   potentially capable of enhancing the Galactic interstellar medium are
   discussed. From the observed line density toward IRC+10216 and toward
   Galactic star forming regions, we estimate the confusion limit toward

   abundance ratios in the envelope are redetermined. We observe, in

Abstract = {{We report the first observations of the 13.5 mu m fundamental band of
   SiS in the spectrum of the heavily obscured carbon star IRC +10216. The
   lines are formed in the inner region of the circumstellar envelope where
   the gas is accelerating and where the temperature ranges from 800-500 K.
   We have carried out a detailed model of the observed line profiles. Our
   observations are best fit by a gradient in the abundance of SiS. We
   derive an abundance relative to molecular hydrogen of x(SiS) = 4.3 x
   10(-6) ata distance of twelve stellar radii from the central star rising
   to x(SiS)= 4.3 x 10(-5) at a few Stellar radii from the surface of the
   star.}},

Abstract = {{The restricted SCF (single-configuration SCF) and MCSCF
   (multiconfiguration SCF) calculations are performed to compute the
   ground-state electric dipole moments of four pairs of diatomic
   molecules-(1) CO and BF; (2) SiO and AlF; (3) CS and BCl; and (4) SiS
   and AlCl-at a number of internuclear distances on both sides of the
   equilibrium position. Near Hartree-Fock accuracy is obtained in the SCF
   calculations. All eight molecules have a range of internuclear distance
   in which electric dipole moments are of the polarity of A-B+. The shapes
   of computed electric dipole moment functions are discussed in the
   language of the molecular orbital method and in relationship to
   electronegativities of atoms. The present study gives us deeper
   understanding of electron transfer inside molecules and consequently of
   the apparent contradiction between electronegativity and the dipole
   polarity of some molecules. }},
