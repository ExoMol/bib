Abstract = {{We report the detection of SiS rotational lines in high-vibrational
   states as well as SiO and SiC2 lines in their ground vibrational state
   toward IRC+10216 during the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Cycle 0. The
   spatial distribution of these molecules shows compact emission for SiS
   and a more extended emission for SiO and SiC2 and also proves the
   existence of an increase in the SiC2 emission at the outer shells of the
   circumstellar envelope (CSE). We analyze the excitation conditions of
   the vibrationally excited SiS using the population diagram technique,
   and we use a large velocity gradient model to compare with the
   observations. We found moderate discrepancies between the observations
   and the models that could be explained if SiS lines detected are
   optically thick. Additionally, the line profiles of the detected
   rotational lines in the high-energy vibrational states show a decreasing
   linewidth with increasing energy levels. This may be evidence that these
   lines could be excited only in the inner shells, i.e., the densest and
   hottest, of the CSE of IRC+10216.}},

Abstract = {{We present high spectral resolution mid-IR observations of SiS towards
   the C-rich AGB star IRC+10216 carried out with the Texas
   Echelon-cross-Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the NASA Infrared
   Telescope Facility. We have identified 204 ro-vibrational lines of
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32, 26 of (SiS)-Si-29-S-32, 20 of (SiS)-Si-28-S-34, and 15
   of (SiS)-Si-30-S-32 in the frequency range 720-790 cm(-1). These lines
   belong to bands v = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4, and involve rotational
   levels with J(low) less than or similar to 90. About 30 per cent of
   these lines are unblended or weakly blended and can be partially or
   entirely fitted with a code developed to model the mid-IR emission of a
   spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope composed of expanding gas
   and dust. The observed lines trace the envelope at distances to the star
   less than or similar to 35R(star) (similar or equal to 0.7 arcsec). The
   fits are compatible with an expansion velocity of 1 + 2.5(r/R-star-1) km
   s(-1) between 1 and 5R(star), 11km s(-1) between 5 and 20R(star), and
   14.5 km s(-1) outwards. The derived abundance profile of
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 with respect to H-2 is 4.9 x 10(-6) between the stellar
   photosphere and 5R(star), decreasing linearly down to 1.6 x 10(-6) at
   20R(star) and to 1.3 x 10(-6) at 50R(star). (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 seems to be
   rotationally under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the region
   of the envelope probed with our observations and vibrationally out of
   LTE in most of it. There is a red-shifted emission excess in the
   (SiS)-Si-28-S-32 lines of band v = 1-0 that cannot be found in the lines
   of bands v = 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4. This excess could be explained by
   an enhancement of the vibrational temperature around 20R(star) behind
   the star. The derived isotopic ratios Si-28/Si-29, and S-32/S-34 are 17
   and 14, compatible with previous estimates.}},

   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) approach with the
   correlation-consistent basis sets, aug-cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV6Z. Effect
   on the PECs by the relativistic correction is taken into account. The
   way to consider the relativistic correction is to use the second-order
   Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian (DKH2) approximation. And the relativistic
   correction is made at the level of cc-pV5Z basis set. To obtain more
   reliable results, the PECs determined by the MRCI calculations are also
   corrected for size-extensivity errors by means of the Davidson
   modification (MRCI+Q). The PECs are extrapolated to the complete basis

   these PECs, the spectroscopic parameters (T-e, D-e, R-e, omega(e)x(e),
   omega Y-e(e), B-e and alpha(e)) are determined and compared with those
   reported in the literature. With the PECs obtained by the MRCI+Q/DK+56
   calculations, the vibrational levels and inertial rotation and
   centrifugal distortion constants of the first 30 vibrational states are
   calculated for each electronic state involved here when the rotational
   quantum number J is equal to zero. Comparison with the measurements
   shows that the present total-energy extrapolation could improve the
   quality of spectroscopic parameters. On the whole, as expected, the
   spectroscopic parameters and molecular constants closest to the
   experimental data are determined by the MRCI+QJDK+56 calculations for
   these electronic states.},

Year = {{2007}},

Pages = {871-882},
Abstract = {{Aims. Given their photospheric origin and refractive nature, SiS
   molecules can provide major constraints on the relative roles of dust
   condensation and non-equilibrium processes in regulating the chemistry
   in circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars.
   Methods. New SiS multi-transition (sub-) millimetre line observations of
   a sample of AGB stars with varying photospheric C/O-ratios and mass-loss
   rates are presented. A combination of low- and high-energy lines are
   important in constraining the circumstellar distribution of SiS
   molecules. A detailed radiative transfer modelling of the observed SiS
   line emission is performed, including assessment of the effect of
   thermal dust grains in the excitation analysis.
   Results. We find that the circumstellar fractional abundance of SiS in
   these environments has a strong dependence on the photospheric C/O-ratio
   as expected from chemical models. The carbon stars (C/O > 1) have a mean
   fractional abundance of 3.1 x 10(-6), about one order of magnitude
   higher than that found for the M-type AGB stars (C/O < 1) where the mean
   value is 2.7 x 10(-7). These numbers are in reasonable agreement with
   photospheric LTE chemical models. SiS appears to behave similarly to SiO
   in terms of photodissociation in the outer part of the circumstellar
   envelope. In contrast to previous results for the related molecule SiO,
   there is no strong correlation of the fractional abundance with density
   in the CSE, as would be the case if freeze-out onto dust grains were
   important. However, possible time-variability of the line emission in
   the lower J transitions and the sensitivity of the line emission to
   abundance gradients in the inner part of the CSE may mask a correlation
   with the density of the wind. There are indications that the SiS
   fractional abundance could be significantly higher closer to the star
   which, at least in the case of M-type AGB stars, would require
   non-equilibrium chemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{The J = 2-1 and 3-2 rotational lines of the rare isotopomer C(36)S and

   star IRC+10216 (CWLeo). These are the first detections of (36)S-bearing
   molecules in a star and the first spectroscopic detection of Si(36)S.
   From a comparison of (34)S- and (36)S-bearing isotopomers, the
   (34)S/(36)S isotopic ratio is 107(+/-15). This value is comparable to
   values in the interstellar medium of the inner Galactic disk (115) but
   is smaller than the solar value of 288 (Ding et al. 2001). The increase
   of the (36)S abundance relative to (34)S only qualitatively follows
   model predictions of a low mass AGB star. Quantitative agreement of the
   observed (34)S/(36)S ratio with the stellar models can be reached if the
   age of IRC+10216 and Galactic chemical evolution are taken into account.
   Other less likely possibilities are the presence of considerable
   inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium and either IRC+10216 or the
   Sun started with a peculiar (36)S abundance. Other production mechanisms
   potentially capable of enhancing the Galactic interstellar medium are
   discussed. From the observed line density toward IRC+10216 and toward
   Galactic star forming regions, we estimate the confusion limit toward

Abstract = {{The infrared spectra of four isotopic forms of silicon monosulfide in
   natural abundance (SiS)-Si-28-S-32:  87\%, (SiS)-Si-28-S-34:  8\%,
   (SiS)-Si-29-S-32:  4.4\%, (SiS)-Si-30-S-32:  2.9\%) in their ground
   electronic states (1-SIGMA) have been measured using a diode laser
   spectrometer.  An accurate set of Dunham parameters, mass-independent
   parameters and mass scaling coefficients were calculated.  The
   coefficients of the Dunham potential of SiS were also accurately
   determined using a direct fitting procedure.}},
