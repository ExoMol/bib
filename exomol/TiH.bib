Abstract = {{We present a primary transit observation for the ultra-hot (T-eq similar
   to 2400 K) gas giant expolanet WASP-121b, made using the Hubble Space
   Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 in spectroscopic mode across the 1.12-1.64
   mu m wavelength range. The 1.4 mu m water absorption band is detected at
   high confidence (5.4 sigma) in the planetary atmosphere. We also
   reanalyze ground-based photometric light curves taken in the B, r', and
   z' filters. Significantly deeper transits are measured in these optical
   bandpasses relative to the near-infrared wavelengths. We conclude that
   scattering by high-altitude haze alone is unlikely to account for this
   difference and instead interpret it as evidence for titanium oxide and
   vanadium oxide absorption. Enhanced opacity is also inferred across the
   1.12-1.3 mu m wavelength range, possibly due to iron hydride absorption.
   If confirmed, WASP-121b will be the first exoplanet with titanium oxide,
   vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission. The latter
   are important species in M/L dwarfs and their presence is likely to have
   a significant effect on the overall physics and chemistry of the
   atmosphere, including the production of a strong thermal inversion.}},

Title = {{Influence of the C/O ratio on titanium and vanadium oxides in
   protoplanetary disks}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{561}},
Abstract = {{Context. The observation of carbon-rich disks have motivated several
   studies questioning the influence of the C/O ratio on their gas phase
   composition in order to establish the connection between the metallicity
   of hot-Jupiters and that of their parent stars.
   Aims. We propose a method that allows the characterization of the
   adopted C/O ratio in protoplanetary disks independently from the
   determination of the host star composition. Titanium and vanadium
   chemistries are investigated because they are strong optical absorbers
   and also because their oxides are known to be sensitive to the C/O ratio
   in some exoplanet atmospheres.
   Methods. We use a commercial package based on the Gibbs energy
   minimization technique to compute the titanium and vanadium equilibrium
   chemistries in protoplanetary disks for C/O ratios ranging from 0.05 to
   10. Our calculations are performed for pressures in the 10(-6)-10(-2)
   bar domain, and for temperatures ranging from 50 K to 2000 K.
   Results. We find that the vanadium nitride/vanadium oxide and titanium
   hydride/titanium oxide gas phase ratios strongly depend on the C/O ratio
   in the hot parts of disks (T >= 1000 K). Our calculations suggest that,
   in these regions, these ratios can be used as tracers of the C/O value
   in protoplanetary disks.}},

Title = {{TRANSMISSION SPECTROSCOPY OF THE HOT JUPITER WASP-12b FROM 0.7 TO 5 mu m}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{147}},
Abstract = {{Since the first report of a potentially non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio
   (C/O) in its dayside atmosphere, the highly irradiated exoplanet
   WASP-12b has been under intense scrutiny and the subject of many
   follow-up observations. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar
   binary companions similar to 1{''} from WASP-12 has obfuscated
   interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new
   ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of
   WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical
   with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's
   stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H-2
   atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the
   transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as
   TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH)
   for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy
   observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband transit photometry
   from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3
   data to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere,
   respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the
   models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical
   significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis ofWASP-12b
   suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple
   Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870
   +/- 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated
   spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place
   definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.}},

Title = {Systematic study of first-row transition-metal diatomic molecules: A
   self-consistent DFT plus U approach},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Title = {Potential energy curves and electronic structure of 3d transition metal
   hydrides and their cations},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {129},
pages = "214302",
Abstract = {We investigate gas-phase neutral and cationic hydrides formed by 3d
   transition metals from Sc to Cu with density functional theory (DFT)
   methods. The performance of two exchange-correlation functionals,
   Boese-Martin for kinetics (BMK) and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
   (TPSS), in predicting bond lengths and energetics, electronic
   structures, dipole moments, and ionization potentials is evaluated in
   comparison with available experimental data. To ensure a unique
   self-consistent field (SCF) solution, we use stability analysis, Fermi
   smearing, and continuity analysis of the potential energy curves.
   Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively
   correct description of the bond dissociation. We found that on average
   BMK predicted values of dissociation energies and ionization potentials
   are closer to experiment than those obtained with high level wave
   function theory methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the
   fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased.
   Natural bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the
   details of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference
   character in the wave function description of the hydrides is reproduced
   in broken-symmetry DFT description, as evidenced by NBO analysis. We
   also propose a new scheme to correct for spin contamination arising in
   broken-symmetry DFT approach. Unlike conventional schemes, our spin
   correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
   individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
   values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure
   singlet state from the energy of the broken-symmetry DFT description of
   the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
   and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized
   electron pairs). The high spin states are build with canonical natural
   orbitals and do not require SCF convergence.},

Abstract = {A titanium hollow cathode lamp in combination with a dye laser and a

Abstract = {Using previous measurements and quantum chemical calculations to derive

   abundance of TiH in M and L dwarf atmospheres and conclude that it is
   much higher than previously thought. We find that the TiH/TiO ratio
   increases strongly with decreasing metallicity, and at high temperatures
   can exceed unity. We suggest that, particularly for subdwarf L and M
   dwarfs, spectral features of TiH near \&SIM; 0.52 and 0.94 \&mu; m and
   in the H band may be more easily measurable than heretofore thought. The
   recent possible identification in the L subdwarf 2MASS J0532 of the 0.94

   that looking for TiH in other dwarfs and subdwarfs will shed light on

   (SOCI), with either an effective core potential basis set (SBKJC) or a

Abstract = {A method of analysis is proposed and applied to the rotational spectra

   polynomial assuming that the spectrum is a smooth function of angular

   fact, the measured spectra often show some irregularities (deviations
   from a smooth behavior) and this becomes clearly visible if one
   analyzes: the data in terms of the present method. This method of
   analysis therefore detects at which angular moments the irregularities
   occur in the data and such information would be most useful for
   understanding the nature of the perturbation which is responsible for
   the occurrence of irregularities. How the actual spectra would look like
