Title = {{Titanium chemistry of WASP-121 b with ESPRESSO in 4-UT mode}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {694},
Abstract = {Transit spectroscopy usually relies on the integration of one or several
   transits to achieve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) necessary to resolve
   spectral features. Consequently, high-S/N observations of exoplanet
   atmospheres, where we can forgo integration, are essential for
   disentangling the complex chemistry and dynamics beyond global trends.
   In this study, we combined two partial 4-UT transits of the ultrahot
   Jupiter WASP-121 b, observed with the ESPRESSO at the European Southern
   Observatory's Very Large Telescope in order to revisit its titanium
   chemistry. Through cross-correlation analysis, we achieved detections of
   H I, Li I, Na I, K I, Mg I, Ca I, Ti I, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Fe I, Fe II, Co
   I, Ni I, Ba II, Sr I, and Sr II. Additionally, narrow-band spectroscopy
   allowed us to resolve strong single lines, resulting in significant
   detections of H alpha, H beta, H gamma, Li I, Na I, K I, Mg I, Ca II, Sr
   I, Sr II, and Mn I. Our most notable finding is the high-significance
   detection of Ti I (similar to 5 sigma per spectrum, and similar to 19
   sigma stacked in the planetary rest frame). Comparison with atmospheric
   models reveals that Ti I is indeed depleted compared to V I. We also
   resolve the planetary velocity traces of both Ti I and V I, with Ti I
   exhibiting a significant blueshift toward the end of the transit. This
   suggests that Ti I primarily originates from low-latitude regions within
   the super-rotating jet observed in WASP-121 b. Our observations suggest
   limited mixing between the equatorial jet and the mid-latitudes, in
   contrast with model predictions from General Circulation Models. We also
   report the non-detection of TiO, which we attribute to inaccuracies in
   the line list that could hinder its detection, even if present. Thus,
   the final determination of the presence of TiO must await space-based
   observations. We conclude that the 4-UT mode of ESPRESSO is an excellent
   testbed for achieving high S/N on relatively faint targets, paving the
   way for future observations with the Extremely Large Telescope.},

  journal = AJ,
  abstract = {We report an attempt to detect molecular and atomic species in the atmosphere of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-33b using the high-resolution echelle spectrograph NEID with a wavelength coverage of 380–930 nm. By analyzing the transmission spectrum of WASP-33b using the line-by-line technique and the cross-correlation technique, we confirm previous detection of Hα, Hβ, Hγ, and Ca ii infrared triplets. We find no evidence for a significant day-to-night wind in WASP-33b, taking into account the effects of stellar pulsations using a relatively novel Gaussian process method and poorly constrained systemic velocity measurements. We also detect the previously reported pretransit absorption signal, which may be a pulsation mode induced by the planet. Combined with previous CARMENES and HARPS-N observations, we report the nondetection of TiO, Ti i, and V i in the transmission spectrum, while they were already detected in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33b. This implies a difference in the chemical compositions and abundances between the dayside and terminator atmospheres of WASP-33b and certainly requires further improvements in the sensitivity of the detection methods.}

   computed the first grid of evolutionary models of T.ZOs with the MESA
   stellar evolution code. With these models, we predict several
   observational properties of T.ZOs, including their surface temperatures
   and luminosities, pulsation periods, and nucleosynthetic products. We
   expand the range of possible T.ZO solutions to cover 3.45 less than or
   similar to log (T (eff) /K) less than or similar to 3.65 and 4.85 less
   than or similar to log (L /L (circle dot)) less than or similar to 5.5.
   Due to the much higher densities our T.ZOs reach compared to previous
   models, if T.ZOs form we expect them to be stable over a larger mass
   range than previously predicted, without exhibiting a gap in their mass
   distribution. Using the GYRE stellar pulsation code we show that T. ZOs
   should have fundamental pulsation periods of 1000-2000 d, and period
   ratios of approximate to 0.2-0.3. Models computed with a large 399
   isotope fully coupled nuclear network show a nucleosynthetic signal that
   is different to previously predicted. We propose a new nucleosynthetic
   signal to determine a star's status as a T. ZO: the isotopologues (44)
   TiO2 and (44) TiO, which will have a shift in their spectral features as
   compared to stable titanium-containing molecules. We find that in the
   local Universe (similar to SMC metallicities and above) T. ZOs show
   little heavy metal enrichment, potentially explaining the difficulty in
   finding T.ZOs to-date.},

  abstract = {{Context. Measurements of relative isotope abundances can provide unique
   insights into the formation and evolution histories of celestial bodies,
   tracing various radiative, chemical, nuclear, and physical processes. In
   this regard, the five stable isotopes of titanium are particularly
   interesting. They are used to study the early history of the Solar
   System, and their different nucleosynthetic origins help constrain
   Galactic chemical models. Additionally, titanium's minor isotopes are
   relatively abundant compared to those of other elements, making them
   more accessible for challenging observations, such as those of exoplanet
   atmospheres. Aims. We aim to assess the feasibility of performing
   titanium isotope measurements in exoplanet atmospheres. Specifically, we
   are interested in understanding whether processing techniques used for
   high-resolution spectroscopy, which remove continuum information about
   the planet spectrum, affect the derived isotope ratios. We also want to
   estimate the signal-to-noise requirements for future observations.
   Methods. We used an archival high-dispersion CARMENES spectrum of the
   M-dwarf GJ 1002 as a proxy for an exoplanet observed at very high
   signal-to-noise. Both a narrow (7045-7090 A) and wide (7045-7500 A)
   wavelength region were defined for which spectral retrievals were
   performed using petitRADTRANS models, resulting in isotope ratios and
   uncertainties. These retrievals were repeated on the spectrum with its
   continuum removed to mimic typical high-dispersion exoplanet
   observations. The CARMENES spectrum was subsequently degraded by adding
   varying levels of Gaussian noise to estimate the signal-to-noise
   requirements for future exoplanet atmospheric observations. Results. The
   relative abundances of all minor Ti isotopes are found to be slightly
   enhanced compared to terrestrial values. A loss of continuum information
   from broadband filtering of the stellar spectrum has little effect on
   the isotope ratios. For the wide wavelength range, a spectrum with a
   signal-to-noise of 5 is required to determine the isotope ratios with
   relative errors less than or similar to 10\%. Super Jupiters at large
   angular separations from their host star are the most accessible
   exoplanets, requiring about an hour of observing time on 8-meter-class
   telescopes, and less than a minute of observing time with the future
   Extremely Large Telescope.}},

   searched for TiO emission in the dayside spectrum of WASP-33b using the
   same data in which the molecule was previously detected with an older
   line list at 4.8 sigma. We intended to confirm the molecular detection

   High-resolution TiO emission models of WASP-33b were created that
   spanned a range of molecular abundances using the radiative transfer
   code petitRADTRANS, and were subsequently cross-correlated with the
   data.Results. We measure a 4.3 sigma TiO emission signature using the
   ExoMol TOTO models, corresponding to a WASP-33b orbital velocity
   semi-amplitude of K-p=252.9(-5.3)(+5.0) kms(-1) and a system velocity of
   v(sys) = 23.0(-4.6)(+4.7) km s(-1). Injection-recovery tests using
   models based on the new and earlier line lists indicate that if the new
   models provide a perfect match to the planet spectrum, the significance
   of the TiO detection should have increased by a factor of similar to 2.
   Conclusions. Although the TiO signal we find is statistically
   significant, comparison with previous works makes our result too
   ambiguous to claim a clear-cut detection. Unexpectedly, the new ExoMol
   TOTO models provide a weaker signal than that found previously, which is
   offset in K-p-v(sys) space. This sheds some doubt on both detections,
   especially in light of a recently published TiO non-detection using a
   different dataset.},

   and near-infrared that have been detected. However, interpretations of
   TiO signatures rely on the accuracy of TiO opacity used in the models.
   The recently reported TOTO TiO line list provides a new opportunity to
   investigate these dependences, which is the goal of this work. First, we
   investigate how the TOTO line list affects observable transmission and
   emission spectra of hot Jupiters at low and high resolutions. The
   improvement in the TOTO line list compared to a previous line list
   results in observable differences in the model spectra, particularly in
   the optical at high resolution. Secondly, we explore the interplay
   between temperature structure, irradiation, and composition with TiO as
   the primary source of optical opacity, using 1D self-consistent
   atmospheric models. Among other trends, we find that the propensity for
   thermal inversions due to TiO peaks at C/O similar to 0.9, consistent
   with recent studies. Using these models, we further assess metrics to
   quantify thermal inversions due to TiO, compared to frequently used
   Spitzer photometry, over a range in C/O, irradiation, metallicity,
   gravity, and stellar type.},

   evolved stars is thought to be initiated by the formation of seed
   particles that can withstand the high temperatures close to the stellar
   photosphere and act as condensation cores farther away from the star.
   TiO and TiO2 are among the candidate species considered as first
   condensates.
   Aims. We aim to identify and characterize the circumstellar gas-phase
   chemistry of titanium that leads to the formation of solid titanium
   compounds in the envelope of o Ceti, the prototypical Mira, and seek an
   observational verification of whether titanium oxides play a major role
   in the onset of dust formation in M-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
   stars.
   Methods. We present high angular resolution (145 mas) ALMA observations
   at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths supplemented by APEX and Herschel
   spectra of the rotational features of TiO and TiO2. In addition,
   circumstellar features of TiO and Ti i are identified in optical
   spectra, which cover multiple pulsation cycles of o Ceti.
   Results. The submm ALMA data reveal TiO and TiO2 bearing gas within the
   extended atmosphere of Mira. While TiO is traceable up to a radius
   (FWHM/2) of 4.0 stellar radii (R-star), TiO2 extends as far as 5.5
   R-star and, unlike TiO, appears to be anisotropically distributed.
   Optical spectra display variable emission of Ti I and TiO from inner
   parts of the extended atmosphere (< 3 R-star).
   Conclusions. Chemical models that include shocks are in general
   agreement with the observations of gas-phase, titanium-bearing
   molecules. It is unlikely that substantial amounts of titanium is locked
   up in solids because the abundance of the gaseous titanium species is
   very high. The formation of hot titanium-rich condensates is very
   improbable because we find no traces of their hot precursor species in
   the gas phase. It therefore appears unlikely that the formation of dust
   in Mira, and possibly other M-type AGB stars, is initiated by titanium oxides.},

   Methods. We used archival data from the 8.2 m Subaru telescope taken

   We created model transmission spectra that include absorption by TiO,

   the correlation signal in time, taking the change in Doppler shift due
   to the orbit of the planet into account.
   Results. We detect no significant cross-correlation signal due to TiO,
   though artificial injection of our template spectra into the data
   indicates a sensitivity down to a volume-mixing ratio of similar to
   10(-10). However, cross-correlating the template spectra with a HARPS
   spectrum of Barnard's star yields only a weak wavelength-dependent

   clear TiO absorption. We infer that the TiO line list poorly matches the
   real positions of TiO lines at spectral resolutions of similar to 100

   atmosphere suites and we show that their synthetic M-dwarf spectra also
   correlate poorly with the HARPS spectra of Barnard's star and five other
   M dwarfs. We conclude that the lack of an accurate TiO line list is

  our spectroscopic census most likely includes >90% of all existing,
  northern-sky M dwarfs with apparent magnitude J < 9. Only 682 stars
  in our sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3);
  most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented
  here for the first time. Spectral subtypes are assigned based on
  spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands; a comparison
  of spectra from the same stars obtained at different observatories,
  however, reveals that spectral band index measurements are dependent
  on spectral resolution, spectrophotometric calibration, and other
  instrumental factors. As a result, we find that a consistent classification
  scheme requires that spectral indices be calibrated and corrected
  for each observatory/instrument used. After systematic corrections
  and a recalibration of the subtype-index relationships for the CaH2,
  CaH3, TiO5, and TiO6 spectral indices, we find that we can consistently
  and reliably classify all our stars to a half-subtype precision.
  The use of corrected spectral indices further requires us to recalibrate
  the ? parameter, a metallicity indicator based on the ratio of TiO
  and CaH optical bandheads. However, we find that our ? values are
  not sensitive enough to diagnose metallicity variations in dwarfs
  of subtypes M2 and earlier (?0.5 dex accuracy) and are only marginally
  useful at later M3-M5 subtypes (?0.2 dex accuracy). Fits of our spectra
  to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective
  temperatures. These suggest the existence of a plateau in the M1-M3
  subtype range, in agreement with model fits of infrared spectra but
  at odds with photometric determinations of T eff. Existing geometric
  parallax measurements are extracted from the literature for 624 stars,
  and are used to determine spectroscopic and photometric distances
  for all the other stars. Active dwarfs are identified from measurements
  of H? equivalent widths, and we find a strong correlation between
  H? emission in M dwarfs and detected X-ray emission from ROSAT and/or
  a large UV excess in the GALEX point source catalog. We combine proper
  motion data and photometric distances to evaluate the (U, V, W) distribution
  in velocity space, which is found to correlate tightly with the velocity
  distribution of G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. However, active
  stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which
  is consistent with those stars being younger on average. Our catalog
  will be most useful to guide the selection of the best M dwarf targets
  for exoplanet searches, in particular those using high-precision
  radial velocity measurements.},

  Clouds using VLT+XSHOOTER, and we fit MARCS model atmospheres to
  different regions of the spectra, deriving effective temperatures
  for each star from (1) the TiO bands, (2) line-free continuum regions
  of the SEDs, and (3) the integrated fluxes. We show that the temperatures
  derived from fits to the TiO bands are systematically lower than
  the other two methods by several hundred kelvin. The TiO fits also
  dramatically overpredict the flux in the near-IR, and imply extinctions

  the SED temperatures provide good fits to the fluxes at all wavelengths
  other than the TiO bands, are in agreement with the temperatures
  from the flux integration method, and imply extinctions consistent

  this discrepancy, we conclude that three-dimensional effects (i.e.,
  granulation) are the most likely cause, as they affect the temperature
  structure in the upper layers where the TiO lines form. The continuum,

  abstract = {Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observations indicate that several
  transiting extrasolar giant planets have thermal inversions in their
  upper atmospheres. Above a relative minimum, the temperature appears
  to increase with altitude. Such an inversion probably requires a
  species at high altitude that absorbs a significant amount of incident
  optical/UV radiation. Some authors have suggested that the strong
  optical absorbers titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) could
  provide the needed additional opacity, but if regions of the atmosphere
  are cold enough for Ti and V to be sequestered into solids they might
  rain out and be severely depleted. With a model of the vertical distribution
  of a refractory species in gaseous and condensed form, we address
  the question of whether enough TiO (or VO) could survive aloft in
  an irradiated planet's atmosphere to produce a thermal inversion.
  We find that it is unlikely that VO could play a critical role in
  producing thermal inversions. Furthermore, we find that macroscopic
  mixing is essential to the TiO hypothesis; without macroscopic mixing,
  such a heavy species cannot persist in a planet's upper atmosphere.
  The amount of macroscopic mixing that is required depends on the
  size of condensed titanium-bearing particles that form in regions
  of an atmosphere that are too cold for gaseous TiO to exist. We parameterize
  the macroscopic mixing with the eddy diffusion coefficient K(zz)
  and find, as a function of particle size a, the values that K(zz)
  must assume on the highly irradiated planets HD 209458b, HD 149026b,
  TrES-4, and OGLE-TR-56b to loft enough titanium to the upper atmosphere
  for the TiO hypothesis to be correct. On these planets, we find that
  for TiO to be responsible for thermal inversions K(zz) must be at
  least a few times 10(7) cm(2) s(-1), even for a = 0.1 mu m, and increases
  to nearly 10(11) cm(2) s(-1) for a = 10 mu m. Such large values may
  be problematic for the TiO hypothesis, but are not impossible.},

  opacity due to TiO and VO gases we term ``pM class'' planets, and
  those that are cooler we term ``pL class'' planets. We calculate
  model atmospheres for these planets, including pressure-temperature
  profiles, spectra, and characteristic radiative time constants. We
  show that pM class planets have temperature inversions (hot stratospheres),
  appear ``anomalously'' bright in the mid-infrared secondary eclipse,
  and feature molecular bands in emission rather than absorption. From
  simple physical arguments, we show that they will have large day/night
  temperature contrasts and negligible phase shifts between orbital
  phase and thermal emission light curves, because radiative timescales
  are much shorter than possible dynamical timescales. The pL class
  planets absorb incident flux deeper in the atmosphere where atmospheric
  dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. This will
  lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts
  in thermal emission light curves. The boundary between these classes
  (similar to 0.04-0.05 AU from a Sun-like primary for solar composition)
  is particularly dependent on the incident flux from the parent star,
  and less so on other factors. We apply these results to several planets
  and note that the eccentric transiting planets HD 147506b and HD
  17156b alternate between the classes. Thermal emission in the optical

  planets attractive targets for optical detection. The difference
  in the observed day/night contrast between v And b (pM class) and
  HD 189733b (pL class) is naturally explained in this scenario.},

  the mechanism of nitrogen hydrogenation in the presence of transition

  addition of H-2 to the metal oxide to form the HMOH species overcoming
  the barriers of 13.5 (Ti), 18.3 (V), and 8.6 (Cu) kcal/mol. HMOH
  can form N2M(H)OH complexes with molecular nitrogen bound by 9.3,

  reaction proceeds by hydrogen migration from the metal atom to nitrogen
  to produce NN(H)MOH over the barriers of 43-44 kcal/mol for the early
  transition metals and 28.8 kcal/mol for Cu. The NN(H)MOH intermediates
  can undergo a second H migration from 0 to the hydrogen-free N atom
  leading to the formation of the N2H2MO complexes of trans-diazene
  with metal oxides stabilized by 31.6, 26.8, and 38.4 kcal/mol for
  Ti, V, and Cu, respectively. The barriers for this step are higher

  reaction pathway, N,Ti(H)OH-->NN(H)- Ti(H)O-->N2H2TiO, where the
  first H atom is transferred from 0 and the second from Ti, the barriers
  for individual reaction steps are 47.8 and 20.2 kcal/mol, and the
  highest in energy transition state for the second H transfer lies
  38.1 kcal/mol above the initial reactants, is preferable in the N-2/H-2/TiO

  of the R-e(r) function, a merged fit of the observed distributions,
  the reported radiative lifetimes of three vibrational levels in the
  B(3)Pi state, and the reported value of R-e(r) for the (0, 0) band
  were performed; R-e(r) was determined as R-e(r) = 1.3723(79){[}1
  - 0.316(81)(r - r(0)) + 2.0(10)(r - r(0))(2)](r(0) = 1.6648 Angstrom
  and 1.5131 Angstrom < r < 1.8636 Angstrom). The r-dependence of R-e(r)
  was much smaller than the reported theoretical predictions. The obtained
  values of R-e(r) were analyzed simultaneously with the hyperfine
  coupling constants for the X-3 Delta state and the spin-orbit constants
  for the X-3 Delta and B(3)Pi states to assess the ionic and orbital
  characters. It was found that the r-dependence of R-e(r) could be
  accounted for by both the configuration interaction in the B(3)Pi
  state and the polarization in the unpaired 9sigma and 4pi orbitals.

  to be an effect of dust formation. Comparison of the observations

  recent ``dusty{''} atmospheres by Tsuji (2000) and by Allard(1999),
  and a synthesis code (Pavlenko et al. 1995) working under LTE conditions
  which considers the chemical equilibrium of more than 100 molecular
  species and the detailed opacities for the most relevant bands. Our
  computations show that the alkali elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs
  govern the optical spectra of the objects in our sample, with Na
  and K contributing significantly to block the optical emergent radiation.
  Molecular absorption bands of oxides (TiO and VO) and hydrides (CrH,
  Fell and CaH) also dominate at these wavelengths in the early L-types
  showing a strength that progressively decreases for later types.
  We find that the densities of these molecules in the atmospheres
  of our objects are considerably smaller by larger factors than those
  predicted by chemical equilibrium considerations. This is consistent
  with Ti and V atoms being depleted into grains of dust. In order
  to reproduce the overall shape of the optical spectra of our observations
  an additional opacity is required to be implemented in the computations.
  We have modelled it with a simple law of the form a(o) (nu/nu(o))(N),
  With N = 4, and found that this provides a sufficiently good fit
  to the data. This additional opacity could be due to molecular/dust
  absorption or to dust scattering. We remark that the equivalent widths
  and intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity.
  In particular, the lithium resonance line at 670.8 nm, which is widely
  used as a substellarity discriminator, is more affected by the additional
  opacity than by the natural depletion of neutral lithium atoms into
  molecular species. Our theoretical spectra displays a rather strong
  resonance feature even at very cool effective temperatures (similar
  to 1000 K); depending on the effective temperature and on the amount
  of dust in the atmospheres of very cool dwarfs, it might be possible
  to achieve the detection of lithium even at temperatures this cool.
  Changes in the physical conditions governing dust formation in L-type
  objects will cause variability of the alkali lines, particularly
  of the shorter wavelength lines.},

  of the M-class (M8-M9.5), and the other five belong to the cooler
  ``L{''} class. We also present spectra for the two new L dwarfs found
  by the EROS 2 proper-motion survey. We introduce a scheme for L dwarf
  classification that is based on an extension to cooler spectra of
  a pseudocontinuum ratio previously defined for M dwarfs. For calibrating
  the spectral subclasses, we use a temperature scale for late-M and
  L dwarfs recently obtained by Basri et al, from synthetic spectrum
  fitting of high-resolution profiles of Cs I and Rb I resonance lines.
  We define that the subclass range from LO to L6 corresponds to the
  temperature range from 2200 K to 1600 K. Our subclasses L0, L1, and
  L2 agree with recent findings by Kirkpatrick et al., but then they
  diverge such that our L6 is equivalent to their L8. We find that
  late-M and L dwarf subclasses can be assigned either in the optical
  with the PC3 index or in the near-infrared with the H(2)O H-band
  index. We discuss the main photospheric features present in L dwarf
  spectra, in particular in the region 400-650 Mn, which has never
  been shown before. The TiO bands at 549.7, 559.7, 615.9, and 638.4
  nm fade with decreasing temperature, but do not vanish until well
  inside the L domain (similar to L5). The Na I 589.0, 589.6 nm resonance
  doublet in our latest object (L6) becomes the broadest atomic feature
  ever seen in any cool dwarf. We do not detect H(alpha) emission in
  our L dwarfs later than L3. We discuss the ages and masses of our
  objects using their temperatures and absence or presence of lithium.
  Finally, we compare two L1 dwarfs with different gravities (one with
  lithium and one without it) and discuss differences in spectral features.},

  journal = ApJ,
  year = {1999},
  volume = {516},
  pages = {900-915},
  abstract = {We examine several theories that describe how stellar magnetic fields
  on classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) interact with their surrounding
  accretion disks. We demonstrate that these theories require magnetic
  field strengths ranging from a few hundred to several thousand gauss,
  depending on which model is used and more importantly on the properties
  of individual systems. For example, the CTTS BP Tau is predicted
  to have a relatively strong magnetic field (1.4-4.1 kG), which should
  be detectable. We present infrared (IR) and optical echelle spectra
  of BP Tau and several reference stars of similar spectral class.
  Using detailed spectrum synthesis and the latest model atmospheres,
  we fitted 12 absorption features in the optical spectrum, including
  the strong titanium oxide (TiO) band head at 7055 Angstrom. For BP
  Tau we determine key stellar parameters: effective temperature (T(eff)
  = 4055 +/- 112 K), gravity (log g = 3.67 +/- 0.50), metallicity ({[}M/H]
  = 0.18 +/- 0.11), projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 10.2 +/-
  1.8 km s(-1)), and optical veiling (r = 0.00-0.15). A similar analysis
  of 61 Cyg B (K7 V) is used to validate the methodology, We then use
  the IR spectra to look for Zeeman broadening, which has a more pronounced
  effect at longer wavelengths. A Zeeman sensitive Ti I line at 2.2233
  mu m appears significantly broadened in BP Tau, relative to several
  rotationally broadened standard stars. The observed line is also
  significantly broader than predictions based on our optical analysis.
  Interpreting this excess broadening as Zeeman splitting of the Ti
  I line, we fitted the spectrum and find a distribution of field strengths
  whose surface averaged mean is (B) over bar = 2.6 +/- 0.3 kG. We
  did not use the Zeeman sensitive Fe I line at 8468.4 Angstrom when
  determining stellar or magnetic parameters for BP Tau, so this line
  provides a test of our results. The observed line profile is indeed
  broader than the nonmagnetic prediction, but the 8468.4 Angstrom
  line gives a magnetic flux lower than what was obtained in the IR,
  perhaps indicating that strong fields are concentrated into cool
  spots. Finally, we investigate an ad hoc model in which the IR line
  is assumed to form in the accretion disk itself. We discuss several
  reasons why the magnetic model is preferred, but the disk atmosphere
  example illustrates that our magnetic field measurement must still
  be tested using several IR lines with a range of Zeeman sensitivities.},

  higher vibrational states. We determine empirical wavelength corrections
  for 12 strong gamma-bands near 6680 and 7090 Angstrom. For the sequence

  near 8463 Angstrom, where an epsilon Q(3) 0-0 band head is expected,
  demonstrating that the electronic oscillator strength of 0.014 advocated

  states were determined at the complete active space self-consistent

  states were determined at both the CASSCF and the internally contracted
  multireference configuration-interacti on (IC-MRCI) level. The CASSCF
  active space can be made sufficiently large that the effect of electron
  correlation on the transition moments is included quantitatively.
  The theoretical radiative lifetimes for the short-lived states are
  generally within 10\% of the recent laser fluorescence measurements
  of Hedgecock, Naulin, \& Costes. For the v = 0 level of the E-3 Pi.
  state, we obtain a radiative lifetime of 4259 ns, consistent with
  their determination of tau(v=0) > 2000 ns, but much longer than the
  lifetime of 770 +/- 40 ns reported by Simard \& Hackett. Except for
  the 8-bands, the theoretical oscillator strengths are less than those

  opacity. Our computation is an extension of, and based on, the thesis

  opacity due to all relevant isotopes of TiO and due to the epsilon
  system. Line frequencies and excitation energies of lines in the
  epsilon-system as well as the f-value were computed based on recently

  stellar atmospheres, whereas a detailed treatment of all the isotopic
  systems were found to be of less importance for the stellar structure.

  parameters and search for their annual variations. In 1992/93 the
  photometric monitoring was carried out along with low resolution
  high signal-to-noise spectroscopy of V 410 Tau in the spectral region
  of the TiO bands near lambda 7100, LiI lambda 6707 and H alpha. We
  found a relationship between the TiO bands strength and stellar brightness
  in favor of the cool spot hypothesis. Parameters of the spotted region
  were derived, and an integrated spectrum of the spotted star was
  calculated using synthetic spectra of stellar atmospheres. The H
  alpha emission was found to vary in a more complex way, with two
  flux maxima at the phases of axial rotation when the spot is near
  the stellar limb. High resolution H alpha profiles were obtained
  for all phases of the rotational period.},

  for the gamma-band region (12 500-19 000 cm(-1)) of TiO in an Ar
  matrix. The spectra show two sets of transitions that can be assigned
  to TiO molecules at inequivalent matrix sites. Sharp absorption bands
  and temperature-independent A terms are found to be quantitatively
  consistent, with the 4 pi <-- 6 sigma electronic excitation of randomly
  oriented molecules at high-symmetry sites. For the other site(s),
  which are associated with broad absorption bands and temperature-dependent
  C terms, a model is proposed where ground-state orbital angular momentum
  is partially quenched by a low-symmetry crystal field. Semiquantitative
  application of this model explains some of the finer details of the
  spectra and suggests a preferential orientation of the low-symmetry
  sites where the molecular axis is perpendicular to the surface of
  the matrix-deposition window.},

  abstract = {Infrared IJHK photometry is presented for 322 red dwarf stars. The
  photometry has an estimated mean error of 3\% and has been taken
  mainly from the literature. Where available, optical UBVR and infrared
  LL'M photometry is also given. Stars with optical spectra available
  are classified using the TiO and VO bands. The spectra and published
  measures of H-alpha widths are used to identify stars with chromospheric
  activity. Space motions are calculated for stars with radial velocities,
  proper motions, and trigonometric parallaxes, and used to estimate
  kinematic population. Binary systems, implied by variable radial
  velocity measurements or reported in infrared imaging searches, are
  noted. The kinematic information allows us to identify metallicity
  effects in the infrared color:color diagrams. Metallicity variations
  lead to changes in the H- continuum opacity, and in the strength
  of the water vapor bands, which are clearly demonstrated in the infrared
  photometry. Nonintuitively, the water band absorption strength increases
  with decreasing metallicity. These opacity effects are used to group
  the stars into five metal-rich to metal-poor categories, ranging
  from young disk to halo. The photometric errors account for an uncertainty
  in this metallicity scheme of one class. As has been found previously,
  there is not an exact correspondence between metallicity and space
  motion, although trends are clear. Absolute magnitudes are determined
  for single stars with good quality trigonometric parallaxes, and
  infrared photometric parallax relations are derived for each metallicity
  group. The position of emission-line stars in the absolute-magnitude:color
  diagrams, and the frequency of chromospheric activity, are consistent
  with current ideas associating activity with either relative ``youth{''}
  or with the presence of a companion. For young disk, old disk, and
  halo low-mass stars, we use the relatively metal-independent I -
  J as the primary temperature classifier, and give intrinsic, colors,
  spectral types and absolute magnitudes. These results will be useful
  for other observational studies and should also be used to constrain
  new models of both the interiors and atmospheres of low-mass stars,
  in an effort to resolve the current disagreements between theory
  and observation.},

  4.3 3 , ? e '' = 1016.3, ? e x e '' = 3.9 3 . Morse potential Franck-Condon

  1 ?-d 1 ? systems and the theoretical intensity distributions for
  each system calculated. Measured relative integrated intensities
  of the ? system compared well with theoretical values calculated
