Journal = AA,
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{599}},
Abstract = {{Context. The formation of silicate dust in oxygen-rich envelopes of
   evolved stars is thought to be initiated by the formation of seed
   particles that can withstand the high temperatures close to the stellar
   photosphere and act as condensation cores farther away from the star.
   TiO and TiO2 are among the candidate species considered as first
   condensates.
   Aims. We aim to identify and characterize the circumstellar gas-phase
   chemistry of titanium that leads to the formation of solid titanium
   compounds in the envelope of o Ceti, the prototypical Mira, and seek an
   observational verification of whether titanium oxides play a major role
   in the onset of dust formation in M-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
   stars.
   Methods. We present high angular resolution (145 mas) ALMA observations
   at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths supplemented by APEX and Herschel
   spectra of the rotational features of TiO and TiO2. In addition,
   circumstellar features of TiO and Ti i are identified in optical
   spectra, which cover multiple pulsation cycles of o Ceti.
   Results. The submm ALMA data reveal TiO and TiO2 bearing gas within the
   extended atmosphere of Mira. While TiO is traceable up to a radius
   (FWHM/2) of 4.0 stellar radii (R-star), TiO2 extends as far as 5.5
   R-star and, unlike TiO, appears to be anisotropically distributed.
   Optical spectra display variable emission of Ti I and TiO from inner
   parts of the extended atmosphere (< 3 R-star).
   Conclusions. Chemical models that include shocks are in general
   agreement with the observations of gas-phase, titanium-bearing
   molecules. It is unlikely that substantial amounts of titanium is locked
   up in solids because the abundance of the gaseous titanium species is
   very high. The formation of hot titanium-rich condensates is very
   improbable because we find no traces of their hot precursor species in
   the gas phase. It therefore appears unlikely that the formation of dust
   in Mira, and possibly other M-type AGB stars, is initiated by titanium
   oxides.}},

   165,000) in the wavelength range of 0.62-0.88 m with the Subaru
   telescope to obtain the day-side spectra of WASP-33b. We suppress and
   correct the systematic effects of the instrument, the telluric and
   stellar lines by using SYSREM algorithm after the selection of good
   orders based on Barnard star and other M-type stars. We detect a 4.8
   sigma signal at an orbital velocity of K-p= +237.5(-5.0)(+13.0) km s(-1)
   and systemic velocity V-sys= -1.5(10.5)(+4.0) km s(-1), which agree with
   the derived values from the previous analysis of primary transit. Our
   detection with the temperature inversion model implies the existence of
   stratosphere in its atmosphere, however, we were unable to constrain the
   volume-mixing ratio of the detected TiO. We also measure the stellar
   radial velocity and use it to obtain a more stringent constraint on the
   orbital velocity, Kp=239.0(1.0)(+2.0) km s(-1). Our results demonstrate
   that high-dispersion spectroscopy is a powerful tool to characterize the

   with high-dispersion spectrograph on current 10m-class and future

Abstract = {{As an exoplanet transits its host star, some of the light from the star
   is absorbed by the atoms and molecules in the planet's atmosphere,
   causing the planet to seem bigger; plotting the planet's observed size
   as a function of the wavelength of the light produces a transmission
   spectrum(1). Measuring the tiny variations in the transmission spectrum,
   together with atmospheric modelling, then gives clues to the properties
   of the exoplanet's atmosphere. Chemical species composed of light
   elements-such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, sodium and potassium-have in
   this way been detected in the atmospheres of several hot giant
   exoplanets(2-5), but molecules composed of heavier elements have thus
   far proved elusive. Nonetheless, it has been predicted that metal oxides
   such as titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide occur in the observable
   regions of the very hottest exoplanetary atmospheres, causing thermal
   inversions on the dayside(6,7). Here we report the detection of TiO in
   the atmosphere of the hot-Jupiter planet WASP-19b. Our combined
   spectrum, with its wide spectral coverage, reveals the presence of TiO
   (to a confidence level of 7.7 sigma), a strongly scattering haze (7.4
   sigma) and sodium (3.4 sigma), and confirms the presence of water (7.9

Journal = AA,

Abstract = {{Context. The spectral signature of an exoplanet can be separated from
   the spectrum of its host star using high-resolution spectroscopy. During
   these observations, the radial component of the planet's orbital
   velocity changes, resulting in a significant Doppler shift that allows
   its spectral features to be extracted.
   Aims. In this work, we aim to detect TiO in the optical transmission
   spectrum of HD 209458b. Gaseous TiO has been suggested as the cause of
   the thermal inversion layer invoked to explain the dayside spectrum of
   this planet.
   Methods. We used archival data from the 8.2 m Subaru telescope taken
   with the High Dispersion Spectrograph of a transit of HD209458b in 2002.
   We created model transmission spectra that include absorption by TiO,
   and cross-correlated them with the residual spectral data after removal
   of the dominating stellar absorption features. We subsequently co-added
   the correlation signal in time, taking the change in Doppler shift due
   to the orbit of the planet into account.
   Results. We detect no significant cross-correlation signal due to TiO,
   though artificial injection of our template spectra into the data
   indicates a sensitivity down to a volume-mixing ratio of similar to
   10(-10). However, cross-correlating the template spectra with a HARPS
   spectrum of Barnard's star yields only a weak wavelength-dependent
   correlation, even though Barnard's star is an M4V dwarf that exhibits
   clear TiO absorption. We infer that the TiO line list poorly matches the
   real positions of TiO lines at spectral resolutions of similar to 100
   000. Similar line lists are also used in the PHOENIX and Kurucz stellar
   atmosphere suites and we show that their synthetic M-dwarf spectra also
   correlate poorly with the HARPS spectra of Barnard's star and five other
   M dwarfs. We conclude that the lack of an accurate TiO line list is
   currently critically hampering this high-resolution retrieval technique.}},

  abstract = {We present a spectroscopic catalog of the 1564 brightest (J < 9) M
	dwarf candidates in the northern sky, as selected from the SUPERBLINK
	proper motion catalog. Observations confirm 1408 of the candidates
	to be late-K and M dwarfs with spectral subtypes K7-M6. From the
	low (? > 40 mas yr?1) proper motion limit and high level of completeness
	of the SUPERBLINK catalog in that magnitude range, we estimate that
	our spectroscopic census most likely includes >90% of all existing,
	northern-sky M dwarfs with apparent magnitude J < 9. Only 682 stars
	in our sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3);
	most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented
	here for the first time. Spectral subtypes are assigned based on
	spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands; a comparison
	of spectra from the same stars obtained at different observatories,
	however, reveals that spectral band index measurements are dependent
	on spectral resolution, spectrophotometric calibration, and other
	instrumental factors. As a result, we find that a consistent classification
	scheme requires that spectral indices be calibrated and corrected
	for each observatory/instrument used. After systematic corrections
	and a recalibration of the subtype-index relationships for the CaH2,
	CaH3, TiO5, and TiO6 spectral indices, we find that we can consistently
	and reliably classify all our stars to a half-subtype precision.
	The use of corrected spectral indices further requires us to recalibrate
	the ? parameter, a metallicity indicator based on the ratio of TiO
	and CaH optical bandheads. However, we find that our ? values are
	not sensitive enough to diagnose metallicity variations in dwarfs
	of subtypes M2 and earlier (?0.5 dex accuracy) and are only marginally
	useful at later M3-M5 subtypes (?0.2 dex accuracy). Fits of our spectra
	to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective
	temperatures. These suggest the existence of a plateau in the M1-M3
	subtype range, in agreement with model fits of infrared spectra but
	at odds with photometric determinations of T eff. Existing geometric
	parallax measurements are extracted from the literature for 624 stars,
	and are used to determine spectroscopic and photometric distances
	for all the other stars. Active dwarfs are identified from measurements
	of H? equivalent widths, and we find a strong correlation between
	H? emission in M dwarfs and detected X-ray emission from ROSAT and/or
	a large UV excess in the GALEX point source catalog. We combine proper
	motion data and photometric distances to evaluate the (U, V, W) distribution
	in velocity space, which is found to correlate tightly with the velocity
	distribution of G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. However, active
	stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which
	is consistent with those stars being younger on average. Our catalog
	will be most useful to guide the selection of the best M dwarf targets
	for exoplanet searches, in particular those using high-precision
	radial velocity measurements.},

Abstract = {We present results including measurement and analysis of titanium
   monoxide. Pulsed, nanosecond Nd:YAG laser radiation is used in a typical
   laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy arrangement to record the spectra.
   This scheme provides experiments analogous to pulsed laser deposition
   tactics and allows for time-resolved spectroscopic analysis. The
   computed spectra are generated from a new, accurate line-strength file
   that allows us to accurately predict gamma (A(3)Phi -> X-3 Delta) and
   gamma' (B-3 Pi -> X-3 Delta) spectral signatures. We infer temperature
   on the order of 3600 +/- 700 K and 4200 +/- 800 K at time delays of 52
   and 72 mu s, respectively. Current interest in this work includes
   titania (TiO2) nanoparticle generation for thin film applications. (C)

	the radiative model of McKay, Marley, Fortney, and collaborators

	simulations develop a broad eastward equatorial jet, mean westward

	develop a hot (> 2000 K) dayside stratosphere whose horizontal dimensions
	are small at depth but widen with altitude. Despite this stratosphere,

  abstract = {Spitzer Space Telescope infrared observations indicate that several
	transiting extrasolar giant planets have thermal inversions in their
	upper atmospheres. Above a relative minimum, the temperature appears
	to increase with altitude. Such an inversion probably requires a
	species at high altitude that absorbs a significant amount of incident
	optical/UV radiation. Some authors have suggested that the strong
	optical absorbers titanium oxide (TiO) and vanadium oxide (VO) could
	provide the needed additional opacity, but if regions of the atmosphere
	are cold enough for Ti and V to be sequestered into solids they might
	rain out and be severely depleted. With a model of the vertical distribution
	of a refractory species in gaseous and condensed form, we address
	the question of whether enough TiO (or VO) could survive aloft in
	an irradiated planet's atmosphere to produce a thermal inversion.
	We find that it is unlikely that VO could play a critical role in
	producing thermal inversions. Furthermore, we find that macroscopic
	mixing is essential to the TiO hypothesis; without macroscopic mixing,
	such a heavy species cannot persist in a planet's upper atmosphere.
	The amount of macroscopic mixing that is required depends on the
	size of condensed titanium-bearing particles that form in regions
	of an atmosphere that are too cold for gaseous TiO to exist. We parameterize
	the macroscopic mixing with the eddy diffusion coefficient K(zz)
	and find, as a function of particle size a, the values that K(zz)
	must assume on the highly irradiated planets HD 209458b, HD 149026b,
	TrES-4, and OGLE-TR-56b to loft enough titanium to the upper atmosphere
	for the TiO hypothesis to be correct. On these planets, we find that
	for TiO to be responsible for thermal inversions K(zz) must be at
	least a few times 10(7) cm(2) s(-1), even for a = 0.1 mu m, and increases
	to nearly 10(11) cm(2) s(-1) for a = 10 mu m. Such large values may

	appear ``anomalously'' bright in the mid-infrared secondary eclipse,

	simple physical arguments, we show that they will have large day/night
	temperature contrasts and negligible phase shifts between orbital
	phase and thermal emission light curves, because radiative timescales
	are much shorter than possible dynamical timescales. The pL class
	planets absorb incident flux deeper in the atmosphere where atmospheric
	dynamics will more readily redistribute absorbed energy. This will
	lead to cooler day sides, warmer night sides, and larger phase shifts
	in thermal emission light curves. The boundary between these classes
	(similar to 0.04-0.05 AU from a Sun-like primary for solar composition)
	is particularly dependent on the incident flux from the parent star,
	and less so on other factors. We apply these results to several planets
	and note that the eccentric transiting planets HD 147506b and HD
	17156b alternate between the classes. Thermal emission in the optical
	from pM class planets is significant redward of 400 nm, making these
	planets attractive targets for optical detection. The difference

	nearly equal-mass binary with separation >0.18" and places limits
	on the existence of additional faint companions. An examination of
	TiO and CaH features in the primary's spectrum is consistent with
	solar metallicity and provides no evidence that G203-50 is metal-poor.
	We estimate an age for the primary of 1-5 Gyr based on activity.
	Assuming coevality of the companion, its age, gravity, and metallicity
	can be constrained from properties of the primary, making it a suitable
	benchmark object for the calibration of evolutionary models and for
	determining the atmospheric properties of peculiar blue L dwarfs.
	The low total mass (M(tot) = 0.21 +/- 0.03 M(circle dot)), intermediate
	mass ratio (q = 0.45 +/- 0.14), and wide separation of this system
	demonstrate that the star formation process is capable of forming
	wide, weakly bound binary systems with low-mass and brown dwarf components.
	Based on the sensitivity of our search we find that no more than
	2.2\% of the early-to-mid-M dwarfs (9.0 < M(V) < 13.0) have wide
	substellar companions with m greater than or similar to 0.06 M(circle

	recent ``dusty{''} atmospheres by Tsuji (2000) and by Allard(1999),
	and a synthesis code (Pavlenko et al. 1995) working under LTE conditions
	which considers the chemical equilibrium of more than 100 molecular
	species and the detailed opacities for the most relevant bands. Our
	computations show that the alkali elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs
	govern the optical spectra of the objects in our sample, with Na
	and K contributing significantly to block the optical emergent radiation.
	Molecular absorption bands of oxides (TiO and VO) and hydrides (CrH,
	Fell and CaH) also dominate at these wavelengths in the early L-types
	showing a strength that progressively decreases for later types.
	We find that the densities of these molecules in the atmospheres
	of our objects are considerably smaller by larger factors than those
	predicted by chemical equilibrium considerations. This is consistent
	with Ti and V atoms being depleted into grains of dust. In order
	to reproduce the overall shape of the optical spectra of our observations
	an additional opacity is required to be implemented in the computations.
	We have modelled it with a simple law of the form a(o) (nu/nu(o))(N),
	With N = 4, and found that this provides a sufficiently good fit
	to the data. This additional opacity could be due to molecular/dust
	absorption or to dust scattering. We remark that the equivalent widths
	and intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity.
	In particular, the lithium resonance line at 670.8 nm, which is widely
	used as a substellarity discriminator, is more affected by the additional
	opacity than by the natural depletion of neutral lithium atoms into
	molecular species. Our theoretical spectra displays a rather strong
	resonance feature even at very cool effective temperatures (similar
	to 1000 K); depending on the effective temperature and on the amount
	of dust in the atmospheres of very cool dwarfs, it might be possible
	to achieve the detection of lithium even at temperatures this cool.
	Changes in the physical conditions governing dust formation in L-type
	objects will cause variability of the alkali lines, particularly
	of the shorter wavelength lines.},

  pages = {900-915},
  abstract = {We examine several theories that describe how stellar magnetic fields
	on classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) interact with their surrounding
	accretion disks. We demonstrate that these theories require magnetic
	field strengths ranging from a few hundred to several thousand gauss,
	depending on which model is used and more importantly on the properties
	of individual systems. For example, the CTTS BP Tau is predicted
	to have a relatively strong magnetic field (1.4-4.1 kG), which should
	be detectable. We present infrared (IR) and optical echelle spectra
	of BP Tau and several reference stars of similar spectral class.
	Using detailed spectrum synthesis and the latest model atmospheres,
	we fitted 12 absorption features in the optical spectrum, including
	the strong titanium oxide (TiO) band head at 7055 Angstrom. For BP
	Tau we determine key stellar parameters: effective temperature (T(eff)
	= 4055 +/- 112 K), gravity (log g = 3.67 +/- 0.50), metallicity ({[}M/H]
	= 0.18 +/- 0.11), projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 10.2 +/-
	1.8 km s(-1)), and optical veiling (r = 0.00-0.15). A similar analysis
	of 61 Cyg B (K7 V) is used to validate the methodology, We then use
	the IR spectra to look for Zeeman broadening, which has a more pronounced
	effect at longer wavelengths. A Zeeman sensitive Ti I line at 2.2233
	mu m appears significantly broadened in BP Tau, relative to several
	rotationally broadened standard stars. The observed line is also
	significantly broader than predictions based on our optical analysis.
	Interpreting this excess broadening as Zeeman splitting of the Ti
	I line, we fitted the spectrum and find a distribution of field strengths
	whose surface averaged mean is (B) over bar = 2.6 +/- 0.3 kG. We
	did not use the Zeeman sensitive Fe I line at 8468.4 Angstrom when
	determining stellar or magnetic parameters for BP Tau, so this line
	provides a test of our results. The observed line profile is indeed
	broader than the nonmagnetic prediction, but the 8468.4 Angstrom
	line gives a magnetic flux lower than what was obtained in the IR,
	perhaps indicating that strong fields are concentrated into cool
	spots. Finally, we investigate an ad hoc model in which the IR line
	is assumed to form in the accretion disk itself. We discuss several
	reasons why the magnetic model is preferred, but the disk atmosphere
	example illustrates that our magnetic field measurement must still
	be tested using several IR lines with a range of Zeeman sensitivities.},

	On the other hand, the isotopes affect the synthetic spectra, and

	LL'M photometry is also given. Stars with optical spectra available
	are classified using the TiO and VO bands. The spectra and published
	measures of H-alpha widths are used to identify stars with chromospheric
	activity. Space motions are calculated for stars with radial velocities,
	proper motions, and trigonometric parallaxes, and used to estimate
	kinematic population. Binary systems, implied by variable radial
	velocity measurements or reported in infrared imaging searches, are
	noted. The kinematic information allows us to identify metallicity
	effects in the infrared color:color diagrams. Metallicity variations
	lead to changes in the H- continuum opacity, and in the strength
	of the water vapor bands, which are clearly demonstrated in the infrared
	photometry. Nonintuitively, the water band absorption strength increases
	with decreasing metallicity. These opacity effects are used to group
	the stars into five metal-rich to metal-poor categories, ranging
	from young disk to halo. The photometric errors account for an uncertainty
	in this metallicity scheme of one class. As has been found previously,
	there is not an exact correspondence between metallicity and space
	motion, although trends are clear. Absolute magnitudes are determined
	for single stars with good quality trigonometric parallaxes, and
	infrared photometric parallax relations are derived for each metallicity
	group. The position of emission-line stars in the absolute-magnitude:color
	diagrams, and the frequency of chromospheric activity, are consistent
	with current ideas associating activity with either relative ``youth{''}
	or with the presence of a companion. For young disk, old disk, and
	halo low-mass stars, we use the relatively metal-independent I -
	J as the primary temperature classifier, and give intrinsic, colors,
	spectral types and absolute magnitudes. These results will be useful
	for other observational studies and should also be used to constrain

	faint (I almost-equal-to 20m), emission-line star, PC 0025 + 0447.
	This object was discovered as part of a grism survey for high redshift
	quasars; the very strong (> 250 angstrom equivalent width) H-alpha
	emission line was detected by our automated line search algorithm.
	The spectrum has two unresolved emission lines (H-alpha and H-beta)
	near zero velocity, superposed on the absorption spectrum of a very
	red M dwarf which has strong K I, the strongest VO bands known, and
	relatively weak bands of TiO. The weakness of subordinate lines of
	Na I (lambda-8192) and other spectral features suggest that it is
	definitely a cooler, and probably fainter, analog of LHS 2924. The
	strength of the emission lines indicates that PC 0025 + 0447 is very
	young; it may be a fading, predecessor brown dwarf at an estimated
	M(bol) approaching 14m at a distance of almost-equal-to 60 pc.},

	5358.2 Angstrom, 5389.6 Angstrom and 5422.0 Angstrom and have been
	shown to belong to the 1-0 sequence of the ? system (c 1 ?-a 1 ?).
	The following constants have been calculated for the system (all
	in cm -1 ): T e ' - T e '' = 17 890.5, ? e ' = 916.7, ? e x e ' =
	4.3 3 , ? e '' = 1016.3, ? e x e '' = 3.9 3 . Morse potential Franck-Condon
	factors have been computed for the c 1 ?-a 1 ?, b 1 ?-a 1 ? and b
	1 ?-d 1 ? systems and the theoretical intensity distributions for
	each system calculated. Measured relative integrated intensities
	of the ? system compared well with theoretical values calculated
	from the Franck-Condon factors and confirm the identification of
	the new bands. Expected positions of unobserved sequences of each
	system are indicated and tentative assignments have been made for
	some previously unidentified bands},
