abstract = {We report the observation and analysis of a new electronic transition in gas-phase vanadium hydride (VH), identified as the C′5Δ–X5Δ (1,0) band with an origin at 14,015 cm−1 (714 nm). The spectrum was recorded by laser excitation spectroscopy, with laser-induced fluorescence detected to the X5Δ (v = 1) level. Dispersed fluorescence measurements enabled a detailed characterization of the vibrationally excited ground state, yielding a vibrational interval of ΔG1/2 = 1606.6(2) cm−1. Despite the presence of significant local perturbations—particularly in the Ω = 0 and 1 spin components of the C′5Δ state—a full rotational analysis of the spectrum using a Hund's case (a) Hamiltonian was achieved. Spectroscopic constants including rotational, spin–orbit, spin–rotation, and Λ-doubling parameters are reported for both the new C′5Δ state and the X5Δ (v = 1) level. Additionally, we observed a small local perturbation in the X5Δ₁ (v = 1) level near J = 9, attributed to homogeneous spin–orbit and heterogeneous L-uncoupling interactions with the previously analyzed A5Π (v = 0) state. An X5Δ ∼ A5Π coupled Hamiltonian was used to model this perturbation and yielded interaction parameters roughly consistent with semi-empirical estimates. This work represents only the second analyzed spectroscopic transition of gas-phase VH.}

  abstract = {We investigate gas-phase neutral and cationic hydrides formed by 3d
	transition metals from Sc to Cu with density functional theory (DFT)
	methods. The performance of two exchange-correlation functionals,
	Boese-Martin for kinetics (BMK) and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
	(TPSS), in predicting bond lengths and energetics, electronic structures,
	dipole moments, and ionization potentials is evaluated in comparison
	with available experimental data. To ensure a unique self-consistent
	field (SCF) solution, we use stability analysis, Fermi smearing,
	and continuity analysis of the potential energy curves. Broken-symmetry
	approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively correct description
	of the bond dissociation. We found that on average BMK predicted
	values of dissociation energies and ionization potentials are closer
	to experiment than those obtained with high level wave function theory
	methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the fraction of
	the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased. Natural
	bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the details
	of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference character
	in the wave function description of the hydrides is reproduced in
	broken-symmetry DFT description, as evidenced by NBO analysis. We
	also propose a new scheme to correct for spin contamination arising
	in broken-symmetry DFT approach. Unlike conventional schemes, our
	spin correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
	individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
	values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure
	singlet state from the energy of the broken-symmetry DFT description
	of the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
	and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized
	electron pairs). The high spin states are build with canonical natural
	orbitals and do not require SCF convergence.},

  abstract = {The dissociation energy curves of low-lying spin-mixed states for
	Group 5 hydrides (VH, NbH, and TaH), as well as Group 3 hydrides
	(ScH, YH, and LaH), have been calculated by using both effective
	core potential (ECP) and all-electron (AE) approaches. The two approaches
	are based on the multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF)
	method, followed by second-order configuration interaction (SOCI)
	calculations: the first method employs an ECP basis set proposed
	by Stevens and co-workers (SBKJC) augmented by a set of polarization
	functions, and spin-orbit coupling effects are estimated with a one-electron
	approximation, using effective nuclear charges. The second method
	employs a double-zeta basis set developed by Huzinaga (MIDI) and
	three sets of p functions are added to both transition element and
	hydrogen and one set of f functions is also added to the transition
	element. The relativistic elimination of small components (RESC)
	scheme and full Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian are employed in the AE approaches
	to incorporate relativistic effects. The present paper reports a
	comprehensive set of theoretical results including the dissociation
	energies, equilibrium distances, electronic transition energies,
	harmonic frequencies, anharmonicities, and rotational constants for
	several low-lying spin-mixed states in the hydrides, filling a considerable
	gap in available data for these molecules. Transition moments are
	also computed among the spin-mixed states, and qualitative agreement
	is obtained for Group 3 hydrides in comparison with the experimental
	results reported by Ram and Bernath. Peak positions of emission spectra
	in Group 5 hydrides are also predicted.},
