abstract  ="Velocity map imaging has been employed to study multi-photon fragmentation of vanadium monoxide (VO) via the C 4Σ− state. The fragmentation dynamics are interpreted in terms of dissociation at the three-photon level{,} with the first photon weakly resonant with transitions to vibrational energy levels of the C 4Σ− state. The dissociation channels accessed are shown to depend strongly on the vibrational level via which excitation takes place. Analysis of the evolution of the kinetic energy release spectrum with photon energy leads to a refined value for the dissociation energy of ground state VO of D0(VO) = 53 126 ± 263 cm−1."}

   high-resolution synthetic spectral library using PHOENIX model
   atmospheres and develop a reliable tool to estimate stellar parameters
   from high-resolution optical and/or near-infrared spectra of M dwarfs.
   We report here the preliminary results of tests characterizing main
   sequence G-K stars from high-resolution spectra. We anchored the atomic
   line-list using the stellar standards Sun, xi Boo A, and epsilon Eri to
   ensure the synthetic spectra computed with PHOENIX reproduce their
   observed counterparts. These stars were chosen because their parameters
   are very well characterized, and on which the absolute accuracy of our
   method depends on.
   We successfully estimated the stellar parameters with associated error
   bars for 17 stars. Using a pseudo Monte Carlo statistical analysis, we
   present overall improved uncertainties on the stellar parameters
   compared to those in the literature (on average 9 K, 0.014 dex, and
   0.008 dex for the effective temperature, the surface gravity, and the
   metallicity, respectively). Our estimated stellar parameters are also in
   good agreement with values found in the literature.}},

eq ∼ 2400 K) gas giant expolanet WASP-121b, made using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 in spectroscopic mode across the 1.12–1.64 μm wavelength range. The 1.4 μm water absorption band is detected at high confidence (5.4σ) in the planetary atmosphere. We also reanalyze ground-based photometric light curves taken in the B, r′, and z′ filters. Significantly deeper transits are measured in these optical bandpasses relative to the near-infrared wavelengths. We conclude that scattering by high-altitude haze alone is unlikely to account for this difference and instead interpret it as evidence for titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption. Enhanced opacity is also inferred across the 1.12–1.3 μm wavelength range, possibly due to iron hydride absorption. If confirmed, WASP-121b will be the first exoplanet with titanium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission. The latter are important species in M/L dwarfs and their presence is likely to have a significant effect on the overall physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, including the production of a strong thermal inversion.}

WASP-33b is the most highly irradiated hot Jupiter discovered to date, and the only exoplanet known to orbit a δ -Scuti star. We observed in spatial scan mode to decrease instrument systematic effects in the data, and removed fluctuations in the data due to stellar pulsations. The rms for our final, binned spectrum is 1.05 times the photon noise. We compare our final spectrum, along with previously published photometric data, to atmospheric models of WASP-33b spanning a wide range in temperature profiles and chemical compositions. We find that the data require models with an oxygen-rich chemical composition and a temperature profile that increases at high altitude. We find that our measured spectrum displays an excess in the measured flux toward short wavelengths that is best explained as emission from TiO. If confirmed by additional measurements at shorter wavelengths, this planet would become the first hot Jupiter with a thermal inversion that can be definitively attributed to the presence of TiO in its dayside atmosphere.},

	Abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is predicted to make great advances in the field of exoplanet atmospheres. Its 25 m2 mirror means that it can reach unprecedented levels of precision in observations of transit spectra, and can thus characterize the atmospheres of planets orbiting stars several hundred pc away. Its coverage of the infrared spectral region between 0.6 and 28 μm allows the abundances of key molecules to be probed during the transit of a planet in front of the host star, and when the same planet is eclipsed constraints can be placed on its temperature structure. In this work, we explore the possibility of using low-spectral-resolution observations by JWST/Near-Infrared Spectrograph and JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrumen-Low Resolution Spectrometer together to optimize wavelength coverage and break degeneracies in the atmospheric retrieval problem for a range of exoplanets from hot Jupiters to super-Earths. This approach involves stitching together non-simultaneous observations in different wavelength regions, rendering it necessary to consider the effect of time-varying instrumental and astrophysical systematics. We present the results of a series of retrieval feasibility tests examining the effects of instrument systematics and starspots on the recoverability of the true atmospheric state, and demonstrate that correcting for these systematics is key for successful exoplanet science with JWST.},

abstract = {More than a thousand exoplanets have been discovered over the last decade.
Perhaps more excitingly, probing their atmospheres has become possible. With current
data we have glimpsed the diversity of exoplanet atmospheres that will be revealed
over the coming decade. However, numerous questions concerning their chemical composition,
thermal structure, and atmospheric dynamics remain to be answered. More observations
of higher quality are needed. In the next years, the selection of a space-based
mission dedicated to the spectroscopic characterization of exoplanets would revolutionize
our understanding of the physics of planetary atmospheres. Such a mission was
proposed to the ESA cosmic vision program in 2014. Our paper is therefore based on
the planned capabilities of the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory (EChO), but
it should equally apply to any future mission with similar characteristics. With
its large spectral coverage (0.4 − 16 μm), high spectral resolution (λ/Δλ > 300
below 5 μm and λ/Δλ > 30 above 5 μm) and 1.5m mirror, a future mission such as
EChO will provide spectrally resolved transit lightcurves, secondary eclipses
lightcurves, and full phase curves of numerous exoplanets with an unprecedented
signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we review some of today’s main scientific
questions about gas giant exoplanets atmospheres, for which a future mission such
as EChO will bring a decisive contribution.},

	Abstract = {We report Gemini-North Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph observations of the inflated hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b during two primary transits. We simultaneously observed two comparison stars and used differential spectrophotometry to produce multiwavelength light curves. `White' light curves and 29 `spectral' light curves were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the system parameters and produce transmission spectra from 520 to 930 nm in ≈14 nm bins. The light curves contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise, and we used a Gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. Common mode corrections derived from the white light-curve fits were applied to the spectral light curves which significantly improved our precision, reaching typical uncertainties in the transit depth of ∼2 × 10−4, corresponding to about half a pressure scale height. The low-resolution transmission spectra are consistent with a featureless model, and we can confidently rule out broad features larger than about one scale height. The absence of Na/K wings or prominent TiO/VO features is most easily explained by grey absorption from clouds in the upper atmosphere, masking the spectral features. However, we cannot confidently rule out clear atmosphere models with low abundances (∼10−3 solar) of TiO, VO or even metal hydrides masking the Na and K wings. A smaller scale height or ionization could also contribute to muted spectral features, but alone are unable to account for the absence of features reported here.},

	Abstract = {We present transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b taken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectra cover the wavelength range 5808--6380 {\AA} with a resolving power of R= 5000. We detect absorption from the Na i doublet within the exoplanet's atmosphere at the 9σ confidence level within a 5 {\AA} band (absorption depth 0.09 $\pm$ 0.01 per cent) and use the data to measure the doublet's spectral absorption profile. We detect only the narrow cores of the doublet. The narrowness of the feature could be due to an obscuring high-altitude haze of an unknown composition or a significantly sub-solar Na i abundance hiding the line wings beneath an H2 Rayleigh signature. These observations are consistent with previous broad-band spectroscopy from Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and STIS, where a featureless spectrum was seen. We also investigate the effects of starspots on the Na i line profile, finding that their impact is minimal and within errors in the sodium feature.We compare the spectral absorption profile over 5.5 scale heights with model spectral absorption profiles and constrain the temperature at different atmospheric regions, allowing us to construct a vertical temperature profile. We identify two temperature regimes: a 1280 $\pm$ 240 K region derived from the Na i doublet line wings corresponding to altitudes below ∼500 km, and a 2800 $\pm$ 400 K region derived from the Na i doublet line cores corresponding to altitudes from ∼500 to 4000 km. The zero altitude is defined by the white-light radius of RP/R★= 0.15628 $\pm$ 0.00009. The temperature rises with altitude, which is likely evidence of a thermosphere.The absolute pressure scale depends on the species responsible for the Rayleigh signature and its abundance. We discuss a plausible scenario for this species, a high-altitude silicate haze and the atmospheric temperature--pressure profile that results. In this case, the high-altitude temperature rise for HD 189733b occurs at pressures of 10−5 to 10−8 bar.},

   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental

	Abstract = {The 3d-element transition metal dioxide MO(2), peroxide M(O(2)), and
   superoxide MOO clusters (M=Sc-Zn), are studied by density functional
   theory with the B1LYP functional. The reliability of the methods and
   basis sets employed was tested by a reinvestigation of the monoxides,
   for which a database of experimental data is available. The global
   minima on the M+O(2) potential energy surfaces correspond to dioxide
   structure, the only exception being CuOO, with a superoxide structure.
   All Zn dioxygen clusters are thermodynamically unstable-their ground
   states lie higher than the dissociation limit to Zn+O(2). Our
   calculations are in favor of the high-spin configurations for the
   FeO(2), CoO(2), and NiO(2) ground states, which are still a subject of
   extensive theoretical and experimental studies. These assignments are
   confirmed by the coupled-cluster method, CCSD(T), except for NiO(2).
   Based on the existence of a stable NiO(2) monoanion in a (4)B(1) state,
   however, it can be concluded that NiO(2) in its (5)A(1) state should
   also be stable. The vibrational frequencies are calculated for clusters
   entrapped in the cubic cell of solid Ar matrix and compared with those
   obtained for gas-phase clusters. The matrix has no influence on the
   vibrations of the monoxides and most of the dioxides; however, Co and
   Ni-dioxoclusters interact strongly with the atoms from the noble gas
   matrix. The most intense frequencies in the IR spectra are shifted to
   lower energies and the ordering of the low-lying electronic states by
   stability is also reversed. According to the electrostatic potential
   maps, the oxygen atoms in the peroxides are more nucleophilic than those
   in the dioxides and superoxides. The terminal oxygen atom in superoxides
   is more nucleophilic than its M-bonded oxygen atom, though charge
   distribution analysis predicts a smaller negative charge on the terminal
   oxygen. TiO(2) is the only dioxide in which nucleophilic character in
   the vicinity of the metal cation is induced. },

   in both sets of spectra, fine and hyperfine structures were resolved.
   The data sets for VN and VO were fit with Hund's case (a) and case (b)
   Hamiltonians, respectively, and rotational, fine structure, and
   hyperfine constants determined. For VN, however, an additional hyperfine
   parameter, Delta a, was necessary for the analysis of the Omega = 2
   sublevel to account for perturbations from a nearby (1)Delta state, in
   addition to the usual Frosch and Foley constants. Determination of Delta
   a suggests that the (1)Delta state lies similar to 3000 cm(-1) above the
   ground state. In VO, the hyperfine structure in the F-2 and F-3
   components was found to become heavily mixed due to an avoided crossing,
   predicted by previous optical studies to be near the N = 15 level. The

These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L -band spectra. The near-infrared spectra are combined with previously published red-optical spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to ~0.6 μm. Prominent atomic and molecular absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti, Na, and K and 19 new weak CH 4 absorption features in the H -band spectra of mid- to late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0-0 band of the A 4 Π- X 4 Σ - transition of VO at ~1.06 μm in the spectra of L dwarfs and the P - and R -branches of the ν 3 band of CH 4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf. The equivalent widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type and are absent by a spectral type of ~L0, except for the 1.189 μm Fe I line, which persists to at least ~L3. We compute the bolometric luminosities of the dwarfs in our sample with measured parallaxes and find good agreement with previously published results that use L '-band photometry to account for the flux emitted from 2.5 to 3.6 μm. Finally, 2MASS J2224381-0158521 (L4.5) has an anomalously red spectrum and the strongest Δν = +2 CO bands in our sample.

	Abstract = {First-principles calculations of nondefective VO in the Fm (3) over barm
   structure based on a range of single-particle Hamiltonians containing
   varying amounts of exact exchange indicate that the ground electronic
   state is that of a d(3) high spin, antiferromagnetic (AF), Mott-Hubbard
   insulator with an AF(1) spin alignment of the local cation moments. This
   description remains essentially unchanged down to 10\% exact exchange,
   and only for the pure density functional theory (DFT) potential is the
   AF(1) phase found to be metallic. Strong spin-lattice interaction is
   predicted with differences in lattice constant of up to 1.6\% between
   AF(1) and FM (ferromagnetic) order. The AF(1) lattice constant is
   predicted to be similar to4.37 Angstrom, which is roughly 7\% greater
   than the reported lattice constants for the defective material. The bulk
   modulus is comparable to those of CaO, MnO, and NiO. A mapping of total
   energies onto an Ising spin Hamiltonian containing both direct and
   superexchange interactions reveals the dominant magnetic interaction to
   be the direct coupling of antiferromagnetically aligned nearest-neighbor
   cation spins, which leads to the stability of the AF(1) phase. Direct
   coupling energies are found in the range -11.1 to -44.3 meV as the
   proportion of exact exchange is reduced, leading to an estimated
   critical disorder temperature in the range 300-450 K. However, the
   limitations of such mapping are exposed by a consideration of the
   relative stabilities of the AF(1) and AF(3) alignments. Orbital
   projected densities of states reveal filled to unfilled gaps which
   depend strongly on the proportion of exact exchange and for the B3LYP
   potential (20\% exact exchange) are similar to2.5 eV for the
   spin-forbidden xy(up arrow)-->xy(down arrow) excitation, similar to3.0
   eV for xy(up arrow)-->z(2)(up arrow), and similar to3.5 eV for V-->O
   charge transfer. Variationally stable, highly local crystal-field
   excited states ranging in energy from similar to0.6 to similar to2.7 eV
   are predicted for exchange-correlation potentials down to 30\% exact
   exchange and from comparisons with the corresponding band excitation
   estimates of similar to1 to similar to2 eV are obtained for the
   localization energy of Frenkel excitons. From a mapping of the excited
   crystal-field energies onto a Kanamori Hamiltonian, values are obtained
   for the lattice Racah B and C parameters and the d-orbital averaged
   exchange and crystal-field energies. A comparison of mapped and directly

Various ways are discussed to develop DFT for multi-reference systems. The restricted
open-shell singlet (ROSS) formalism is a modification of the conventional open-shell
KS formalism, which makes a reliable, but still economical treatment of open-shell
singlet biradicals possible. The complete-active-space DFT (CAS-DFT) method combines
an explicit treatment of multi-configurational character with the DFT treatment of
dynamic electron correlation effects. Due to the flexibility in the choice of the
active space, this method is in principle appropriate for all kinds of multi-reference
problems. Based on sample calculations for carbenes and organic biradicals, the
advantages and limitations of ROSS-DFT and CAS-DFT are discussed. Some possibilities
for future improvements of DFT methods for multi-reference problems are pointed out.},

Abstract = {Non-local, density functional calculations have been performed on the
   ground and low-lying excited states of the 3d transition metal monoxide
   and monosulfide molecules. Periodic trends in properties such as bond
   lengths, bond energies, vibrational force constants and dipole moments

   compared to those in the monoxide and monosulfide solids. Analysis of
   the electronic structures of the molecules reveals the d-orbital
   splitting to be d(pi)> d(sigma)greater than or equal to d(delta) and
   shows the non-bonding role of the d(sigma) and d(delta) functions. This
   sequence mirrors that in the electronically related dichloride molecules
   and leads to similarities in the periodic trends with those in the
   solids. Systematic errors in the calculated bond energies and
   vibrational frequencies are identified. The successful use of a
   correctly parameterized ligand-field model is reported allowing
   quantitative reproduction of the `d-d' spectra of the monoxide molecules

@article{95AdBaBe.VO,
	Abstract = {The (0,0) band of the (BII)-I-4-X(4) Sigma(-) system of VO near 7900
   Angstrom has been analyzed from Doppler-limited Fourier transform
   emission spectra, together with wavelength-resolved laser-induced
   fluorescence and sub-Doppler intermodulated fluorescence spectra. The
   (BII)-I-4, v = 0 level is heavily perturbed by the a(2) Sigma(+), v = 2
   level. Because the 3d delta(2) 4s sigma a(2) Sigma(+) and 3d delta(2) 3d
   pi B4II states have very different hyperfine parameters, the hyperfine
   patterns of the rotational lines vary dramatically with J at the
   perturbations. The observed hyperfine structure of the band, including
   the lowest-J perturbation, near J = 381/2, could be explained in detail
   by a model Hamiltonian that takes the interactions into account: 3211
   hyperfine line frequencies have been fitted with an rms error of 11 MHz.
   The b parameter (the coefficient of I.S in the magnetic hyperfine
   Hamiltonian) is well determined for the a(2) Sigma(+) state and provides
   the evidence for its electron configuration. The hyperfine structure of
   the (BII)-I-4 state shows no effects of spin-orbit distortion and is
   well explained by the standard case (a(beta J)) model. Only the
   spin-orbit operator is needed to describe the interaction between the a
   and B states; the parameter for the direct dipolar interaction between
   them is too small to be determined. A fit to the higher-J rotational
   data showed that the spin-orbit interaction matrix element, which arises
   as a result of configuration interaction in the two states, has an
   apparent J dependence; this presumably means that the mixing is r
   dependent, Improved values for the ground state hyperfine parameters
   have been obtained from the new data, supplemented by the three very
   precise microwave frequencies measured by Suenram el al. (J. Mel.
   Spectrosc. 148, 114, 1991). (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

@article{95BaMaxx.VO,
	Abstract = {The first transition row oxides and sulfides are studied using several
   different levels of theory. The calculations show the bonding mechanism
   in the sulfides and oxides to be very similar. For the oxides, accurate
   experimental data anew the theoretical methods to be calibrated. The
   same level of theory is used to study the sulfides where there is far
   less experimental information. For ScO through MnO and CuO the coupled
   cluster singles and doubles technique including a perturbational
   estimate of the connected triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)] yields
   spectroscopic constants (r(c), omega(c), and D-o) in good agreement with
   experiment. The triple excitations are found to be very important in
   achieving this accuracy. For FeO to NiO, the self-consistent-field (SCF)
   approach yields pi. orbitals that are localized on the metal or oxygen.
   This appears to cause problems for the single reference techniques; this
   is discussed in detail for NiO. The complete-active-space SCF/internally
   contracted averaged coupled pair functional approach (CASSCF/ICACPF)
   works well for FeO to NiO. The calculation of accurate dipole moments is
   found to be very difficult.},
