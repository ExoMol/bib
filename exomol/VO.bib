Title = {{The bond dissociation energy of VO measured by resonant three-photon
   ionization spectroscopy}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {153},
pages = {024303},
Abstract = {The predissociation threshold of VO has been measured using resonant
   three-photon ionization (R3PI) spectroscopy. Given the high density of
   electronic states in the molecule, it is argued that the molecule
   dissociates rapidly as soon as the thermochemical bond dissociation
   energy (BDE) is exceeded, allowing the measured predissociation
   threshold to be assigned as the BDE. This is the first time a BDE has
   been measured using the R3PI method. The first photon is provided by an
   optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser that promotes VO into a
   high-energy, discrete vibronic state. A tunable dye laser then excites
   the molecule further to a resonant state close to the dissociation limit
   where there is a quasi-continuum of states. A second photon from the
   same dye laser pulse ionizes the molecule, generating VO+ ions. The dye
   laser is then scanned to higher energies, and when the energy of one OPO
   photon plus one dye photon exceeds the BDE, the molecule dissociates
   before another dye photon can be absorbed to induce ionization. The
   combined photon energy at the sharp drop in the ion signal is assigned
   as the BDE. The experiment has been repeated using four different
   intermediate states, all yielding the same BDE, D-0(VO) = 6.545(2) eV.
   Using thermochemical cycles, a revised value for the BDE of cationic VO
   is obtained, D-0(V+-O) = 6.053(2) eV. The 0 K enthalpy of formation for
   VO(g) is also derived as Delta fH0K0 mml:mfenced close={''}){''}
   open={''}({''}VO(g)mml:mfenced = 128.6(1.0) kJ mol(-1). Previous

Title = {{A library of self-consistent simulated exoplanet atmospheres}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2020},
Volume = {498},
Pages = {4680-4704},
Abstract = {We present a publicly available library of model atmospheres with
   radiative-convective equilibrium pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles
   fully consistent with equilibrium chemical abundances, and the
   corresponding emission and transmission spectrum with R similar to 5000
   at 0.2 mu m decreasing to R similar to 35 at 30 mu m, for 89 hot Jupiter
   exoplanets, for four recirculation factors, six metallicities, and six
   C/O ratios. We find the choice of condensation process (local/rainout)
   alters the P-T profile and thereby the spectrum substantially,
   potentially detectable by James Webb Space Telescope. We find H- opacity
   can contribute to form a strong temperature inversion in ultrahot
   Jupiters for C/O ratios >= 1 and can make transmission spectra features
   flat in the optical, alongside altering the entire emission spectra. We
   highlight how adopting different model choices such as thermal
   ionization, opacities, line-wing profiles and the methodology of varying
   the C/O ratio, effects the P-T structure, and the spectrum. We show the
   role of Fe opacity to form primary/secondary inversion in the
   atmosphere. We use WASP-17b and WASP-121b as test cases to demonstrate
   the effect of grid parameters across their full range, while
   highlighting some important findings, concerning the overall atmospheric
   structure, chemical transition regimes, and their observables. Finally,
   we apply this library to the current transmission and emission spectra
   observations of WASP-121b, which shows H2O and tentative evidence for VO
   at the limb, and H2O emission feature indicative of inversion on the
   dayside, with very low energy redistribution, thereby demonstrating the
   applicability of library for planning and interpreting observations of
   transmission and emission spectrum.},

We also reanalyze ground-based photometric light curves taken in the B, r′, and z′

is also inferred across the 1.12–1.3 μm wavelength range, possibly due to iron
hydride absorption. If confirmed, WASP-121b will be the first exoplanet with titanium
oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission. The latter are
important species in M/L dwarfs and their presence is likely to have a significant
effect on the overall physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, including the production

of HD 209458b: Hindrance due to inaccuracies in the line database}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {575},
Pages = {A20},
abstract = {Context. The spectral signature of an exoplanet can be separated from
the spectrum of its host star using high-resolution spectroscopy. During these
observations, the radial component of the planet’s orbital velocity changes,
resulting in a significant Doppler shift that allows its spectral features to be
extracted. Aims. In this work, we aim to detect TiO in the optical transmission
spectrum of HD 209458b. Gaseous TiO has been suggested as the cause of the thermal
inversion layer invoked to explain the dayside spectrum of this planet. Methods.
We used archival data from the 8.2 m Subaru telescope taken with the High Dispersion
Spectrograph of a transit of HD 209458b in 2002. We created model transmission
spectra that include absorption by TiO, and cross-correlated them with the residual
spectral data after removal of the dominating stellar absorption features. We
subsequently co-added the correlation signal in time, taking the change in Doppler
shift due to the orbit of the planet into account. Results. We detect no significant
cross-correlation signal due to TiO, though artificial injection of our template
spectra into the data indicates a sensitivity down to a volume-mixing ratio of ~10-10.
However, cross-correlating the template spectra with a HARPS spectrum of Barnard’s
star yields only a weak wavelength-dependent correlation, even though Barnard’s
star is an M4V dwarf that exhibits clear TiO absorption. We infer that the TiO
line list poorly matches the real positions of TiO lines at spectral resolutions
of ~100 000. Similar line lists are also used in the PHOENIX and Kurucz stellar
atmosphere suites and we show that their synthetic M-dwarf spectra also correlate
poorly with the HARPS spectra of Barnard’s star and five other M dwarfs. We conclude
that the lack of an accurate TiO line list is currently critically hampering this
high-resolution retrieval technique.},

Abstract = {We present observations of two occultations of the extrasolar planet
WASP-33b using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope , which
allow us to constrain the temperature structure and composition of its dayside
atmosphere. WASP-33b is the most highly irradiated hot Jupiter discovered to date,
and the only exoplanet known to orbit a δ -Scuti star. We observed in spatial scan
mode to decrease instrument systematic effects in the data, and removed fluctuations
in the data due to stellar pulsations. The rms for our final, binned spectrum
is 1.05 times the photon noise. We compare our final spectrum, along with previously
published photometric data, to atmospheric models of WASP-33b spanning a wide range
in temperature profiles and chemical compositions. We find that the data require
models with an oxygen-rich chemical composition and a temperature profile that
increases at high altitude. We find that our measured spectrum displays an excess
in the measured flux toward short wavelengths that is best explained as emission
from TiO. If confirmed by additional measurements at shorter wavelengths, this
planet would become the first hot Jupiter with a thermal inversion that can be
definitively attributed to the presence of TiO in its dayside atmosphere.},

Abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is predicted to make great advances
in the field of exoplanet atmospheres. Its 25 m2 mirror means that it can reach
unprecedented levels of precision in observations of transit spectra, and can thus
characterize the atmospheres of planets orbiting stars several hundred pc away.
Its coverage of the infrared spectral region between 0.6 and 28 μm allows the
abundances of key molecules to be probed during the transit of a planet in front
of the host star, and when the same planet is eclipsed constraints can be placed
on its temperature structure. In this work, we explore the possibility of using
low-spectral-resolution observations by JWST/Near-Infrared Spectrograph and JWST/Mid-Infrared
Instrumen-Low Resolution Spectrometer together to optimize wavelength coverage
and break degeneracies in the atmospheric retrieval problem for a range of exoplanets
from hot Jupiters to super-Earths. This approach involves stitching together
non-simultaneous observations in different wavelength regions, rendering it necessary
to consider the effect of time-varying instrumental and astrophysical systematics.
We present the results of a series of retrieval feasibility tests examining the
effects of instrument systematics and starspots on the recoverability of the true
atmospheric state, and demonstrate that correcting for these systematics is key
for successful exoplanet science with JWST.},

thermal structure, and atmospheric dynamics remain to be answered. More observations

our understanding of the physics of planetary atmospheres. Such a mission was
proposed to the ESA cosmic vision program in 2014. Our paper is therefore based on
the planned capabilities of the Exoplanet Characterization Observatory (EChO), but
it should equally apply to any future mission with similar characteristics. With
its large spectral coverage (0.4 − 16 μm), high spectral resolution (λ/Δλ > 300
below 5 μm and λ/Δλ > 30 above 5 μm) and 1.5m mirror, a future mission such as
EChO will provide spectrally resolved transit lightcurves, secondary eclipses
lightcurves, and full phase curves of numerous exoplanets with an unprecedented

Abstract = {We report Gemini-North Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph observations
of the inflated hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b during two primary transits. We simultaneously
observed two comparison stars and used differential spectrophotometry to produce
multiwavelength light curves. `White' light curves and 29 `spectral' light curves
were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the system parameters and
produce transmission spectra from 520 to 930 nm in ≈14 nm bins. The light curves
contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise, and we used a
Gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. Common mode corrections
derived from the white light-curve fits were applied to the spectral light curves
which significantly improved our precision, reaching typical uncertainties in the
transit depth of ∼2 × 10−4, corresponding to about half a pressure scale height.
The low-resolution transmission spectra are consistent with a featureless model,
and we can confidently rule out broad features larger than about one scale height.
The absence of Na/K wings or prominent TiO/VO features is most easily explained
by grey absorption from clouds in the upper atmosphere, masking the spectral features.
However, we cannot confidently rule out clear atmosphere models with low abundances
(∼10−3 solar) of TiO, VO or even metal hydrides masking the Na and K wings. A smaller
scale height or ionization could also contribute to muted spectral features, but
alone are unable to account for the absence of features reported here.},

0.09 $\pm$ 0.01 per cent) and use the data to measure the doublet's spectral
absorption profile. We detect only the narrow cores of the doublet. The narrowness
of the feature could be due to an obscuring high-altitude haze of an unknown

beneath an H2 Rayleigh signature. These observations are consistent with previous
broad-band spectroscopy from Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and STIS, where a
featureless spectrum was seen. We also investigate the effects of starspots on
the Na i line profile, finding that their impact is minimal and within errors in
the sodium feature.We compare the spectral absorption profile over 5.5 scale heights
with model spectral absorption profiles and constrain the temperature at different
atmospheric regions, allowing us to construct a vertical temperature profile. We
identify two temperature regimes: a 1280 $\pm$ 240 K region derived from the Na i
doublet line wings corresponding to altitudes below ∼500 km, and a 2800 $\pm$ 400 
K region derived from the Na i doublet line cores corresponding to altitudes
from ∼500 to 4000 km. The zero altitude is defined by the white-light radius of
RP/R★= 0.15628 $\pm$ 0.00009. The temperature rises with altitude, which is likely
evidence of a thermosphere.The absolute pressure scale depends on the species
responsible for the Rayleigh signature and its abundance. We discuss a plausible
scenario for this species, a high-altitude silicate haze and the atmospheric
temperature--pressure profile that results. In this case, the high-altitude temperature
rise for HD 189733b occurs at pressures of 10−5 to 10−8 bar.},

A self-consistent DFT plus U approach}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {133},
pages = {114103},
Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

the 3d elements: A comparative density functional study}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {128},
pages = {094307},
Abstract = {The 3d-element transition metal dioxide MO(2), peroxide M(O(2)), and
   superoxide MOO clusters (M=Sc-Zn), are studied by density functional
   theory with the B1LYP functional. The reliability of the methods and
   basis sets employed was tested by a reinvestigation of the monoxides,
   for which a database of experimental data is available. The global
   minima on the M+O(2) potential energy surfaces correspond to dioxide
   structure, the only exception being CuOO, with a superoxide structure.
   All Zn dioxygen clusters are thermodynamically unstable-their ground
   states lie higher than the dissociation limit to Zn+O(2). Our
   calculations are in favor of the high-spin configurations for the
   FeO(2), CoO(2), and NiO(2) ground states, which are still a subject of
   extensive theoretical and experimental studies. These assignments are
   confirmed by the coupled-cluster method, CCSD(T), except for NiO(2).
   Based on the existence of a stable NiO(2) monoanion in a (4)B(1) state,
   however, it can be concluded that NiO(2) in its (5)A(1) state should
   also be stable. The vibrational frequencies are calculated for clusters
   entrapped in the cubic cell of solid Ar matrix and compared with those
   obtained for gas-phase clusters. The matrix has no influence on the
   vibrations of the monoxides and most of the dioxides; however, Co and
   Ni-dioxoclusters interact strongly with the atoms from the noble gas
   matrix. The most intense frequencies in the IR spectra are shifted to
   lower energies and the ordering of the low-lying electronic states by
   stability is also reversed. According to the electrostatic potential
   maps, the oxygen atoms in the peroxides are more nucleophilic than those
   in the dioxides and superoxides. The terminal oxygen atom in superoxides
   is more nucleophilic than its M-bonded oxygen atom, though charge
   distribution analysis predicts a smaller negative charge on the terminal
   oxygen. TiO(2) is the only dioxide in which nucleophilic character in
   the vicinity of the metal cation is induced. },

Abstract = {The pure rotational spectra of VN (X-3 Delta(r)) and VO (X-4 Sigma(-))
   have been recorded in the frequency range 290-520 GHz using direct
   absorption spectroscopy. These radicals were synthesized in the
   gas-phase from the reaction Of VCl4 with either N-2 or H2O in an AC
   discharge. Seven rotational transitions were recorded for each molecule;
   in both sets of spectra, fine and hyperfine structures were resolved.
   The data sets for VN and VO were fit with Hund's case (a) and case (b)
   Hamiltonians, respectively, and rotational, fine structure, and
   hyperfine constants determined. For VN, however, an additional hyperfine
   parameter, Delta a, was necessary for the analysis of the Omega = 2
   sublevel to account for perturbations from a nearby (1)Delta state, in
   addition to the usual Frosch and Foley constants. Determination of Delta
   a suggests that the (1)Delta state lies similar to 3000 cm(-1) above the
   ground state. In VO, the hyperfine structure in the F-2 and F-3
   components was found to become heavily mixed due to an avoided crossing,
   predicted by previous optical studies to be near the N = 15 level. The
   hyperfine constants established for these two molecules are consistent
   with the proposed sigma(1)delta(1) and sigma(1)delta(2) electron
   configurations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We present a 0.6-4.1 μm spectroscopic sequence of M, L, and T dwarfs.
The spectra have R ≡ λ/Δλ ≈ 2000 from 0.9 to 2.4 μm and R = 2500-200 from 2.9 to 4.1 μm.
These new data nearly double the number of L and T dwarfs that have reported L -band
spectra. The near-infrared spectra are combined with previously published red-optical
spectra to extend the wavelength coverage to ~0.6 μm. Prominent atomic and molecular
absorption features are identified including neutral lines of Al, Fe, Mg, Ca, Ti,
Na, and K and 19 new weak CH 4 absorption features in the H -band spectra of mid-
to late-type T dwarfs. In addition, we detect for the first time the 0-0 band of
the A 4 Π- X 4 Σ - transition of VO at ~1.06 μm in the spectra of L dwarfs and the
P - and R -branches of the ν 3 band of CH 4 in the spectrum of a T dwarf. The equivalent
widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type
and are absent by a spectral type of ~L0, except for the 1.189 μm Fe I line, which
persists to at least ~L3. We compute the bolometric luminosities of the dwarfs in
our sample with measured parallaxes and find good agreement with previously published
results that use L '-band photometry to account for the flux emitted from 2.5 to 3.6 μm.
Finally, 2MASS J2224381-0158521 (L4.5) has an anomalously red spectrum and the strongest
Δν = +2 CO bands in our sample. This may be indicative of unusually thick condensate

Journal = JMS,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {229},
Pages = {57-62},
Abstract = {High-resolution spectra of VO have been reinvestigated in the
   12000-31000 cm(-1) region. VO was produced in a vanadium hollow cathode
   lamp by discharging 1.5 Torr of Ar and the spectra were recorded using a
   Fourier transform spectrometer. The oxygen needed to produce VO was
   present in the system as an impurity. Three new bands observed in the
   21000-22100 cm(-1) region have been attributed to a new
   (2)Delta-1(2)Delta electronic transition of VO. Two bands, with origins
   near 21044 and 22038 cm(-1), have been assigned as the 0-1 and 0-0 bands
   of the (2)A(3/2)-1(2)Delta(3/2) sub-band while a weak band with an
   origin near 21975 cm(-1) has been assigned as the 0-0 band of the
   corresponding (2)Delta(5/2)-1(2)Delta(5/2) sub-band. A rotational
   analysis of these sub-bands has been obtained and spectroscopic
   constants have been extracted. The 1(2)Delta state is known from the
   previous analyses of the doublet transitions of VO in the near infrared.
   The present observation has allowed the determination of the vibrational
   interval DeltaG(1/2) and the equilibrium rotational constants for the
   1(2)Delta(3/2) state.},

Title = {{Hybrid density functional theory study of vanadium monoxide}},
Journal = PRB,
Year = {2004},
Volume = {69},
pages = {115119},
Abstract = {First-principles calculations of nondefective VO in the Fm (3) over barm
   structure based on a range of single-particle Hamiltonians containing
   varying amounts of exact exchange indicate that the ground electronic
   state is that of a d(3) high spin, antiferromagnetic (AF), Mott-Hubbard
   insulator with an AF(1) spin alignment of the local cation moments. This
   description remains essentially unchanged down to 10\% exact exchange,
   and only for the pure density functional theory (DFT) potential is the
   AF(1) phase found to be metallic. Strong spin-lattice interaction is
   predicted with differences in lattice constant of up to 1.6\% between
   AF(1) and FM (ferromagnetic) order. The AF(1) lattice constant is
   predicted to be similar to4.37 Angstrom, which is roughly 7\% greater
   than the reported lattice constants for the defective material. The bulk
   modulus is comparable to those of CaO, MnO, and NiO. A mapping of total
   energies onto an Ising spin Hamiltonian containing both direct and
   superexchange interactions reveals the dominant magnetic interaction to
   be the direct coupling of antiferromagnetically aligned nearest-neighbor
   cation spins, which leads to the stability of the AF(1) phase. Direct
   coupling energies are found in the range -11.1 to -44.3 meV as the
   proportion of exact exchange is reduced, leading to an estimated
   critical disorder temperature in the range 300-450 K. However, the
   limitations of such mapping are exposed by a consideration of the
   relative stabilities of the AF(1) and AF(3) alignments. Orbital
   projected densities of states reveal filled to unfilled gaps which
   depend strongly on the proportion of exact exchange and for the B3LYP
   potential (20\% exact exchange) are similar to2.5 eV for the
   spin-forbidden xy(up arrow)-->xy(down arrow) excitation, similar to3.0
   eV for xy(up arrow)-->z(2)(up arrow), and similar to3.5 eV for V-->O
   charge transfer. Variationally stable, highly local crystal-field
   excited states ranging in energy from similar to0.6 to similar to2.7 eV
   are predicted for exchange-correlation potentials down to 30\% exact
   exchange and from comparisons with the corresponding band excitation
   estimates of similar to1 to similar to2 eV are obtained for the
   localization energy of Frenkel excitons. From a mapping of the excited
   crystal-field energies onto a Kanamori Hamiltonian, values are obtained
   for the lattice Racah B and C parameters and the d-orbital averaged
   exchange and crystal-field energies. A comparison of mapped and directly
   calculated energies of the two-electron excitation (xz,yz)-->(z(2),x(2)-y(2))
   confirms the validity of Kanamori mapping, notably in the limit of exact exchange.},

   observed for VO at 5630 and 14 920 cm(-1) above the ground state. These
   states are assigned to two doublet states, (2) Sigma(-) and (2) Phi,
   respectively. The 532 and 355 nm spectra of VO2- reveal a single
   vibrational progression for the ground state with a frequency of 970
   cm(-1) (nu(1)). Three electronic excited states are observed for VO2 in
   the 193 nm spectrum. For VO3-, three surprisingly sharp detachment
   transitions are observed at 193 nm, The two excited states of VO3 are
   measured to be 0.59 and 0.79 eV above the ground state. The spectra of

   frequencies and 121 degrees from DFT calculations. New absorptions
   appear on annealing to 35 K that can be assigned to two V2O2 isomers and
   the superoxo adduct to VO2, namely the OOVO2 molecule. Both VO2 and
   OOVO2 reveal weak v(1) + v(3) combination bands, which support the
   assignment of v(1) and v(3) fundamental vibrations.},

Abstract = {The ground and selected low-lying electronic states of the entire series
   of the first-row transition-metal neutral oxides are investigated by the
   use of an improved atom superposition and electron delocalization
   molecular orbital (ASED-MO) approach. Two quantities are found to be
   very important in achieving agreement with experiment: these are the
   (kappa,delta) parameter set - involved in the Wolfsberg-Helmholz
   constant, K - and the charge dependent Slater-type orbital exponents.
   For SeO through CrO the optimum (kappa,delta) set of (0.87, 0.24
   Angstrom(-1)) yields ground states and spectroscopic constants (R(e),
   D-0, omega(e) and mu) in good agreement with experiment. The set (1.00,
   0.35 Angstrom(-1)) works well for MnO to CuO and (0.75, 0.13
   Angstrom(-1)) for ZnO. Calculations are consistent with both ionic and
   covalent bonding contributions in the monoxides. The M-O bond strengths
   exhibit the `'double humped'' shape, characteristic of many periodic
   properties of the transition metals. Moreover, the sharp contrast in the
   calculated bond energies between the early and late transition-metal
   oxides accounts well for the pronounced differences in their
   reactivities.},

Abstract = {The first spectroscopic characterization of the VO2 radical is reported
   along with new results for (VO)-O-17 and tentative assignments for the
   VO3 and V-2(+) radicals. These vanadium radicals were investigated in
   neon matrices at 4 K by electron spin resonance utilizing conventional
   high temperature vaporization and pulsed laser ablation generation
   methods. A detailed ESR study of VO, showed it to be nonlinear with a
   (2)A(1) ground state; the g tensor analysis reveals the presence of an
   excited electronic state (B-2(1)) approximately 1 eV above the ground
   state. This excited state prediction and the observed nuclear hyperfine
   interactions (A tensors) for V-51 and O-17 were compared with
   theoretical results obtained from various ab initio computational
   methods. Ab initio calculations with an extended basis set were
   performed at various levels of theory including UHF, ROHF, CAS-SCF, and
   MR-SDCI (multireference single and double configuration interaction).
   While UHF calculations of the hyperfine interaction were grossly in
   error, the better levels of theory gave qualitative agreement with
   experiment and provided an aid to interpretation. VO2 is predicted to be
   a bent (2)A(1) state, correlating with the linear (2) Delta
   configuration having the odd electron predominantly in the V 3d orbital.
   VO3 is predicted to be planar C-2 upsilon, with the odd electron in a
   b(2) orbital localized in the oxygen in-plane n-type p orbitals. (C)

band of VO at 7900 Angstrom: Perturbations by the A(2)SIGMA(+), V=2 level}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {1995},
Volume = {170},
Pages = {94-130},
Abstract = {The (0,0) band of the (BII)-I-4-X(4) Sigma(-) system of VO near 7900
   Angstrom has been analyzed from Doppler-limited Fourier transform
   emission spectra, together with wavelength-resolved laser-induced
   fluorescence and sub-Doppler intermodulated fluorescence spectra. The
   (BII)-I-4, v = 0 level is heavily perturbed by the a(2) Sigma(+), v = 2
   level. Because the 3d delta(2) 4s sigma a(2) Sigma(+) and 3d delta(2) 3d
   pi B4II states have very different hyperfine parameters, the hyperfine
   patterns of the rotational lines vary dramatically with J at the
   perturbations. The observed hyperfine structure of the band, including
   the lowest-J perturbation, near J = 381/2, could be explained in detail
   by a model Hamiltonian that takes the interactions into account: 3211
   hyperfine line frequencies have been fitted with an rms error of 11 MHz.
   The b parameter (the coefficient of I.S in the magnetic hyperfine
   Hamiltonian) is well determined for the a(2) Sigma(+) state and provides
   the evidence for its electron configuration. The hyperfine structure of
   the (BII)-I-4 state shows no effects of spin-orbit distortion and is
   well explained by the standard case (a(beta J)) model. Only the
   spin-orbit operator is needed to describe the interaction between the a
   and B states; the parameter for the direct dipolar interaction between
   them is too small to be determined. A fit to the higher-J rotational
   data showed that the spin-orbit interaction matrix element, which arises
   as a result of configuration interaction in the two states, has an
   apparent J dependence; this presumably means that the mixing is r
   dependent, Improved values for the ground state hyperfine parameters
   have been obtained from the new data, supplemented by the three very
   precise microwave frequencies measured by Suenram el al. (J. Mel.
   Spectrosc. 148, 114, 1991). (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Year = {1995},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {189-203},
Abstract = {The first transition row oxides and sulfides are studied using several
   different levels of theory. The calculations show the bonding mechanism
   in the sulfides and oxides to be very similar. For the oxides, accurate
   experimental data anew the theoretical methods to be calibrated. The
   same level of theory is used to study the sulfides where there is far
   less experimental information. For ScO through MnO and CuO the coupled
   cluster singles and doubles technique including a perturbational
   estimate of the connected triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)] yields
   spectroscopic constants (r(c), omega(c), and D-o) in good agreement with
   experiment. The triple excitations are found to be very important in
   achieving this accuracy. For FeO to NiO, the self-consistent-field (SCF)
   approach yields pi. orbitals that are localized on the metal or oxygen.
   This appears to cause problems for the single reference techniques; this
   is discussed in detail for NiO. The complete-active-space SCF/internally
   contracted averaged coupled pair functional approach (CASSCF/ICACPF)
   works well for FeO to NiO. The calculation of accurate dipole moments is
   found to be very difficult.},
