Abstract = {{Tungsten (W) is a preferred plasma-facing material for areas of high
   particle and power impact in present day and future fusion devices. The
   lifetime of W plasma-facing components (PFCs) under steady-state
   conditions is limited by erosion processes induced by energetic
   impinging particles such as impurities (carbon C, oxygen O, nitrogen N,
   etc.) and hydrogen isotopes above the threshold energy for Physical
   Sputtering (PS). We discovered for the first time, in addition to the
   bare physical sputtering process of W, a second W erosion mechanism at
   PFCs in TEXTOR (limiter surfaces) and ASDEX Upgrade (divertor target
   plates) during deuterium plasma bombardment. The tungsten deuteride
   molecule WD has been identified spectroscopically via the (6)Pi ->(6)
   Sigma(+) transition in parallel to ordinary neutral W line emission of
   the WI transition (5d(5)(S-6)6s S-7(3) -> 5d(5)(S-6)6(P) P-7(4)) at
   lambda = 400.9nm used as measure to quantify the bare PS process or,
   more precisely, the gross erosion of W. We identified the underlying
   process for the molecular release as Chemically Assisted Physical
   Sputtering (CAPS) as observed also in the case of beryllium or
   lanthanum. Measurements in TEXTOR and ASDEX Upgrade showed a dependence
   of the WD band emission on the surface temperature - connected to the
   deuterium content in the near W surface - as well as on the flux and
   energy of impinging energetic particles. A quantification of the
   released WD is not yet possible due to lack of appropriate molecular
   data for the conversion of photons into particles, but the spatially
   resolved ratio of atomic (WI) and molecular photon flux (WD) indicates
   that the release takes place at the same time, but differently
   distributed along the target plates and limiters reflecting the
   variation in the described critical parameters (impinging ion flux, ion
   impact energy, and material temperature) along the surface. The plasma
   conditions in front of the interaction zone are in both cases fully
   ionising with an electron temperature T-e > 10eV, thus, recombination
   into WD can be excluded.}},

Abstract = {Spectroscopic constants and potential energy curves of 15 electronic
   states of WH are obtained using the complete-active-space
   multi-configuration self-consistent field (CAS MCSCF) followed by full
   second-order configuration-interaction (SOCI) calculations. The
   spin-orbit effects are introduced using the
   relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) method. Our computations
   confirm the assignment of the observed emission spectrum at 6800
   angstrom but yield different vibrational frequencies for the two
   observed states.},
