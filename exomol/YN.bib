Abstract = {Our aim in this study is to investigate the electronic structure of the
   gaseous YN molecule and provide an accurate molecular line list of
   spectroscopic transitions between the five lowest singlet states. The
   calculations were done by using large basis set for yttrium
   aug-cc-pVQZ-PP with relativistic effective core potentials at the
   spin-free level. We first used the method of complete active space
   self-consistent field, which was followed by the multireference singles
   and doubles configuration interaction. Potential energy curves and
   permanent and transition dipole moments were calculated at the
   internuclear distance range of 1.3-2.96 \& Aring;. For each state, we
   calculated the spectroscopic constants (T-e, omega(e), omega(e)x(e),
   omega(e)y(e), B-e, alpha(e), R-e). The calculated values of the
   spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with the experimental
   constants available, with a relative difference of less than 5 cm(-1).
   We further calculated the transition intensities of allowed transitions,
   and we provided the absorption spectra up to a temperature of 4000 K.
   The computed molecular line list contains 2.6 million transitions
   calculated between almost 18 186 vibro-rotational energy levels. It
   covers the frequency range between 0 and 30 000 cm(-1). The effect of
   temperature on the spectra of hot YN was investigated with partition
   functions calculated between 298 and 4000 K. This study should help in
   identifying the singlet state spectrum of the hot YN molecule, which is
   possibly found in the atmospheres of cool stars and hot rocky
   super-Earths.},
