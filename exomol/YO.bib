Abstract = {Complex molecular structure demands customized solutions to laser
   cooling by extending its general set of principles and practices.
   Compared with other laser-cooled molecules, yttrium monoxide (YO)
   exhibits a large electron-nucleus interaction, resulting in a dominant
   hyperfine interaction over the electron spin-rotation coupling. The YO
   ground state is thus comprised of two manifolds of closely spaced
   states, with one of them possessing a negligible Lande g factor. This
   unique energy level structure favors dual-frequency dc magneto-optical
   trapping (MOT) and gray molasses cooling (GMC). We report exceptionally
   robust cooling of YO at 4 mu K over a wide range of laser intensity,
   detunings (one- and two-photon), and magnetic field. The magnetic
   insensitivity enables the spatial compression of the molecular cloud by
   alternating GMC and MOT under the continuous operation of the quadrupole
   magnetic field. A combination of these techniques produces a
   laser-cooled molecular sample with the highest phase space density in free space.},

Abstract = {We report three-dimensional trapping of an oxide molecule (YO), using a
   radio-frequency magneto-optical trap (MOT). The total number of
   molecules trapped is similar to 1.5 x 10(4), with a temperature of
   4.1(5) mK. This diversifies the frontier of molecules that are laser
   coolable and paves the way for the second-stage narrow-line cooling in
   this molecule to the microkelvin regime. Futhermore, the new challenges
   of creating a 3D MOT of YO resolved here indicate that MOTs of more
   complex nonlinear molecules should be feasible as well.},

Journal = ApJS,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {33-50},
Abstract = {V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted at the beginning of 2002 becoming an
   extremely luminous star with L similar or equal to 10(6)L(circle dot) .
   Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the outburst,
   the most promising is a stellar merger event. In this paper, we
   investigate the observational properties of the star and its
   surroundings in the post outburst phase. We have obtained a
   high-resolution optical spectrum of V838 Mon in 2005 October using the
   Keck I telescope. We have identified numerous atomic features and
   molecular bands present in the spectrum and provided an atlas of those
   features. In order to improve the spectrum interpretation, we have
   performed simple modeling of the molecular bands. Our analysis indicates
   that the spectrum is dominated by molecular absorption features arising
   in photospheric regions with temperatures of similar to 2400 K and in
   colder outer layers, where the temperature decreases to similar to 500
   K. A number of resonance lines of neutral alkali metals are observed to
   show P Cygni profiles. Particularly interesting are numerous prominent
   emission lines of {[}Fe II]. All of them show practically the same
   profile, which can be well described by a Lorentzian profile. In the
   blue part of the spectrum, photospheric signatures of the B-type
   companion are easily seen. We have fitted the observed spectrum with a
   synthetic one and the obtained parameters are consistent with the B3V
   type. We have also estimated radial and rotational velocities of the
   companion.},

Journal = {Astron. Rep.},

Pages = {126-142},
Abstract = {We analyze spectra of V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr taken in 2004-2005 using
   the 6 m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory with the UAGS
   and SCORPIO spectrographs; the spectra have a resolution of 4.6 angstrom
   and a high signal-to-noise ratio. We confirm that V838 Mon is a spectral
   binary containing a B3V star and cool oxygen-rich star. We identify AlO,
   TiO, VO, ScO, BaO, ZrO, and YO molecular bands in the cool star's
   spectrum. The TiO absorption band at lambda 4423 angstrom overlaps the
   continuum of the hot B3V star, testifying that the hot star and its cool
   companion form a wide physical pair. Further evidence for the
   components' interaction is the presence of forbidden {[}Fell] lines that
   become stronger in the blue. We detected significant spectral
   variability of the cool star during 10 months in 2004. The spectrum of
   V4332 Sgr in 2005 (11 years after the outburst) contains emission lines
   of neutral metal atoms and of metal oxides against a photospheric
   continuum with a blackbody temperature of 2700 K. We identify the AlI,
   CaI, CrI, MnI, and SrI resonance lines and molecular emission lines of
   AlO, TiO, and VO, along with numerous emission lines of CrI in the
   spectrum. The MgI lambda 4571 angstrom intercombination line is present.
   The emission lines are formed in a large volume of cool low-density gas.
   We conclude based on spectroscopy combined with archive photographs and
   modern CCD photometry that both peculiar red novae were binaries prior
   to their outbursts, and contained blue hot components that exploded. The
   secondary of V838 Mon is a hot B3V star, and that of V4332 Sgr is a cool
   M7 star.},

   D-0(0)(Y-O)=7.14 +/- 0.18 eV. The PFI-ZEKE spectra display an
   interesting channel-coupling effect so that all rotational levels with
   J(+)less than or equal to J(')(A)+0.5 are observed with high intensity,
   where J(+) is the angular momentum of the YO+ cation that is produced
   and J(')(A) is the angular momentum of the A (2)Pi(1/2) state that is
   reached when the first photon is absorbed. This is thought to result
   from the interaction between the dipole moment of the rotating YO+ core
   and the Rydberg electron, which can induce changes in l and J(+) subject
   to the dipolar coupling matrix element selection rule, Delta J(+)=+/- 1,
   Delta l=+/- 1. The channel-coupling mechanism also appears to induce an
   inverse autoionization process in which an unbound electron with a low
   value of l is captured either by its low-J(+) YO+ cation or by a second
   YO+ cation with the same value of J(+). This inverse autoionization
   process is extremely sensitive to the electron kinetic energy, leading
   to narrow peaks in the PFI-ZEKE spectrum which are only slightly broader
   than the laser linewidth employed for this study (0.25 cm(-1)).},

   nm laser ablation of Y2O3. Time-of-Eight (TOF) measurements of the

   During the initial expansion of YO in vacuum, the center-of-mass
   velocity and the expansion velocity increase with distance up to the
   boundary of the Knudsen layer. In the presence of oxygen, reactions of
   the ablated atomic species with oxygen take place, resulting in the
   formation of YO with broad velocity distribution. From the peak time of
   the observed TOF distributions, the most probable velocities of YO are
   found to be 2.6 km/s in vacuum, 2.2 km/s in 50 mTorr Ar, and 1.8 km/s in
   50 mTorr O-2, respectively. The dependence of the peak time on distance
   shows that the experimental data can be well fitted with a shock wave

   spectrometry (ICP-AES). The spectral interferences for 200-pm wide
   windows centred (+/- 100 pm) around the prominent lines of the analytes,
   due to matrix lines and oxide radicals (LuO or YO) that emit band
   spectra depending on the excitation temperature (T-exc.) in ICP were
   investigated. The main result is that for T-exc. = 7200 K, LuO and YO
   band components can be eliminated so that prominent analysis lines of
   La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu and Sm were observed on at smooth background. T-exc..
   = 7200 K was chosen as the optimal excitation temperature in the
   determination of traces of REEs in Lu2O3 and Y2O3. respectively. The
   quantification of the interferences in terms of e-value was used in
   accordance with Boumans and Vrakking {[}Spectrochimica Acta Part B 42

   interferences and negligibly influenced by wing interferences and Lu2O3
   and Y2O3 as matrices do not raise the real detection limits.},

   of YBa2Cu3O7-delta, are reported. In addition, the translational energy
   distributions of Y, Y+, Ba, Ba+, and Cu are reported. Measurements made
   at low and high fluences on YO indicate that there are very large
   differences in the `'temperatures'' inferred between the translational
   and the vibrational/rotational energy channels, implying that energy is
   partitioned in a very nonequilibrium fashion in the expanding plume. A
   measurement of the rotational and vibrational temperatures shows that
   the internal degrees of freedom are equilibrated in the expansion plume
   (Boltzmann distributions) with a temperature of approximately 1000 K
   being observed at normal processing fluences. The translational energy
   distributions of YO are observed to fit a shifted Boltzmann distribution
   at high fluences. The atomic species monitored all display non-Boltzmann
   velocity distributions at high fluences. The peak of the observed
   velocity distributions corresponds to energies as high as 10 eV for the
   YO neutral diatomic and up to several hundred eV for Ba+ at ablation
   fluences of 5 J/cm2. Bimodal velocity distributions are observed for the
   Cu, Ba, and Y neutral atoms at high incident fluences, implying
   ion-electron recombination as a partial source of the high neutral
   velocities.},

   unpaired spin in oxygen, matrix and metal p and 4d orbitals.  An yttrium

   orbital with the rest pressumed to be in metal 4d orbitals.  A different
   Y cluster is formed in cyclohexane that could be a rigid pentemer or
   septemer with a trigonal bipyamidal or pentagonal bipyramidal structure.
