Abstract = {V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted at the beginning of 2002 becoming an
   extremely luminous star with L similar or equal to 10(6)L(circle dot) .
   Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the outburst,
   the most promising is a stellar merger event. In this paper, we
   investigate the observational properties of the star and its
   surroundings in the post outburst phase. We have obtained a
   high-resolution optical spectrum of V838 Mon in 2005 October using the
   Keck I telescope. We have identified numerous atomic features and
   molecular bands present in the spectrum and provided an atlas of those
   features. In order to improve the spectrum interpretation, we have
   performed simple modeling of the molecular bands. Our analysis indicates
   that the spectrum is dominated by molecular absorption features arising
   in photospheric regions with temperatures of similar to 2400 K and in
   colder outer layers, where the temperature decreases to similar to 500
   K. A number of resonance lines of neutral alkali metals are observed to
   show P Cygni profiles. Particularly interesting are numerous prominent
   emission lines of {[}Fe II]. All of them show practically the same
   profile, which can be well described by a Lorentzian profile. In the
   blue part of the spectrum, photospheric signatures of the B-type
   companion are easily seen. We have fitted the observed spectrum with a
   synthetic one and the obtained parameters are consistent with the B3V
   type. We have also estimated radial and rotational velocities of the
   companion.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {126-142},
Abstract = {We analyze spectra of V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr taken in 2004-2005 using
   the 6 m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory with the UAGS
   and SCORPIO spectrographs; the spectra have a resolution of 4.6 angstrom
   and a high signal-to-noise ratio. We confirm that V838 Mon is a spectral
   binary containing a B3V star and cool oxygen-rich star. We identify AlO,
   TiO, VO, ScO, BaO, ZrO, and YO molecular bands in the cool star's
   spectrum. The TiO absorption band at lambda 4423 angstrom overlaps the
   continuum of the hot B3V star, testifying that the hot star and its cool
   companion form a wide physical pair. Further evidence for the
   components' interaction is the presence of forbidden {[}Fell] lines that
   become stronger in the blue. We detected significant spectral
   variability of the cool star during 10 months in 2004. The spectrum of
   V4332 Sgr in 2005 (11 years after the outburst) contains emission lines
   of neutral metal atoms and of metal oxides against a photospheric
   continuum with a blackbody temperature of 2700 K. We identify the AlI,
   CaI, CrI, MnI, and SrI resonance lines and molecular emission lines of
   AlO, TiO, and VO, along with numerous emission lines of CrI in the
   spectrum. The MgI lambda 4571 angstrom intercombination line is present.
   The emission lines are formed in a large volume of cool low-density gas.
   We conclude based on spectroscopy combined with archive photographs and
   modern CCD photometry that both peculiar red novae were binaries prior
   to their outbursts, and contained blue hot components that exploded. The
   secondary of V838 Mon is a hot B3V star, and that of V4332 Sgr is a cool
   M7 star.},

Journal = JCP,

Pages = {5017-5026},
Abstract = {A spectroscopic study of the Rydberg states of YO accessed from
   particular rotational levels of the A (2)Pi(1/2), v=0 state has been
   combined with a pulsed field ionization, zero electron kinetic energy
   (PFI-ZEKE) investigation. The results provide accurate values of the
   ionization energy of YO, ionization energy I.E.(YO)=49 304.316(31)
   cm(-1) {[}6.112 958(4) eV], and of the rotational constant (and bond
   length) of the YO+ cation in its X (1)Sigma(+), v=0 ground state,
   B-0(+)=0.4078(3) cm(-1) {[}r(0)=1.7463(6) Angstrom]. The improved value
   of I.E.(YO) combined with the known ionization energy of atomic yttrium
   then leads to the result D-0(0)(Y-O)-D-0(0)(Y-O)=0.1041 +/- 0.0001 eV.
   Combining this result with the value of D-0(0)(Y+-O) obtained from
   guided ion beam mass spectrometry yields an improved value of
   D-0(0)(Y-O)=7.14 +/- 0.18 eV. The PFI-ZEKE spectra display an
   interesting channel-coupling effect so that all rotational levels with
   J(+)less than or equal to J(')(A)+0.5 are observed with high intensity,
   where J(+) is the angular momentum of the YO+ cation that is produced
   and J(')(A) is the angular momentum of the A (2)Pi(1/2) state that is
   reached when the first photon is absorbed. This is thought to result
   from the interaction between the dipole moment of the rotating YO+ core
   and the Rydberg electron, which can induce changes in l and J(+) subject
   to the dipolar coupling matrix element selection rule, Delta J(+)=+/- 1,
   Delta l=+/- 1. The channel-coupling mechanism also appears to induce an
   inverse autoionization process in which an unbound electron with a low
   value of l is captured either by its low-J(+) YO+ cation or by a second
   YO+ cation with the same value of J(+). This inverse autoionization
   process is extremely sensitive to the electron kinetic energy, leading
   to narrow peaks in the PFI-ZEKE spectrum which are only slightly broader
   than the laser linewidth employed for this study (0.25 cm(-1)).},

   governed by the dynamics of the shock wave generated in the excimer
   ablation. This shock wave compresses the ambient oxygen and leaves a

Year = {1993},

Pages = {1957-1964},
Abstract = {The first simultaneous measurements of the ground-state translational,
   rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of a laser ablated
   diatomic molecule (YO) liberated during a 351 nm excimer laser ablation
   of YBa2Cu3O7-delta, are reported. In addition, the translational energy
   distributions of Y, Y+, Ba, Ba+, and Cu are reported. Measurements made
   at low and high fluences on YO indicate that there are very large
   differences in the `'temperatures'' inferred between the translational
   and the vibrational/rotational energy channels, implying that energy is
   partitioned in a very nonequilibrium fashion in the expanding plume. A
   measurement of the rotational and vibrational temperatures shows that
   the internal degrees of freedom are equilibrated in the expansion plume
   (Boltzmann distributions) with a temperature of approximately 1000 K
   being observed at normal processing fluences. The translational energy
   distributions of YO are observed to fit a shifted Boltzmann distribution
   at high fluences. The atomic species monitored all display non-Boltzmann
   velocity distributions at high fluences. The peak of the observed
   velocity distributions corresponds to energies as high as 10 eV for the
   YO neutral diatomic and up to several hundred eV for Ba+ at ablation
   fluences of 5 J/cm2. Bimodal velocity distributions are observed for the
   Cu, Ba, and Y neutral atoms at high incident fluences, implying
   ion-electron recombination as a partial source of the high neutral
   velocities.},

Abstract = {Deposits given by condensing resistively heated yttrium metal into
   cyclohexane and adamantane matrices under high vacuum and at 77 K on a
   rotating cryostat have been examined by EPR spectroscopy.  The principle
   aramagnetic products under these conditions are YO in at least two
   distinct trapping sites and yttrium clusters, Y(n), where n = 5 or 7.
   Analysis of the yttrium hyperfine interaction for YO indicates that the
   unpaired electron has 60\% metal 5s character with the remainder of the
   unpaired spin in oxygen, matrix and metal p and 4d orbitals.  An yttrium
   cluster, Y(n), is produced in adamantane that is tumbling freely or
   pseudorotating above 205 K and has ca. 10\% unpaired spin in the Y 5s
   orbital with the rest pressumed to be in metal 4d orbitals.  A different
   Y cluster is formed in cyclohexane that could be a rigid pentemer or
   septemer with a trigonal bipyamidal or pentagonal bipyramidal structure.
   It is tentatively suggested that Y5 is formed in adamantane and that Y7
   is formed in cyclohexane.},
