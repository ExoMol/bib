Abstract = {The electronic energy level structure of yttrium monoxide (YO) provides
   a long-lived, low-lying (2)Delta state ideal for high-precision
   molecular spectroscopy, narrowline laser cooling at the single
   photon-recoil limit, and studying dipolar physics with unprecedented
   interaction strength. High-resolution laser spectroscopy of ultracold
   laser-cooled YO molecules is used to study the Stark effect in the A `
   (2)Delta(3/2) J = 3/2 state. An immediate onset of the linear Stark
   effect is observed in the presence of weak applied electric fields due
   to the near-degenerate Lambda doublet and the large electric dipole
   moment. By applying a small electric field the Stark-insensitive state
   is spectroscopically isolated and the absolute transition frequency to
   the X-2 Sigma(+) electronic ground state is determined with a fractional
   frequency uncertainty of 9 x 10(-12). This electric field control is
   necessary to implement a quasi-closed photon-cycling scheme that
   preserves parity. With this scheme the first narrowline laser cooling of
   a molecule is demonstrated, reducing the temperature of sub-Doppler
   cooled YO in two dimensions.},

abstract = {The YO molecules in gas-phase were formed by the reaction of the laser produced yttrium plasma with molecular oxygen and subsequently cooled by free-jet expansion. The YO molecules were studied by laser-induced excitation and dispersed fluorescence (DF) spectroscopy at 0.1 cm-1 spectral resolution. The B2Σ+ state was observed in vibrations v=5 and 6 from the X2Σ+ ground state. The anomalously low spin-rotation constant of the B2Σ+, v=6 level compared to the v=0-5 vibrational levels of the B state indicated perturbation. Investigation of the wavelength filtered excitation spectra led to the observation of the A2Π1/2,v=11 spin-orbit component lying 28.5 cm-1 below the B2Σ+,v=6 state. The deperturbation analysis of the interacting pair of B2Σ+,v=6 ∼ A2Π1/2,v=11 states was carried out by incorporating the spin-orbit, spin-electronic and L-uncouple interaction parameters as off-diagonal matrix elements in the 2Σ+-2Π Hamiltonian. The molecular constants of v=11 of the A and v=6 of the B states followed the vibrational trend after deperturbation. The e-parity level of the B2Σ+, v=6 and A2Π1/2, v=11 crossed after J=25.5 and deperturbation analysis estimated J-dependent configuration mixing up to ∼50% for the e-parity and 16% for the f-parity levels. The value of the configuration mixing coefficient of the interacting A and the B states, obtained from the intensity analysis of the observed vibronic bands in the DF spectra, is in agreement with the depertubation analysis. In addition, the Ω=½ spin-orbit components of the A2Π state was observed in v=12 and 13 vibrations and were found to be unperturbed.}

pages = {021049},
Abstract = {Complex molecular structure demands customized solutions to laser
   cooling by extending its general set of principles and practices.
   Compared with other laser-cooled molecules, yttrium monoxide (YO)
   exhibits a large electron-nucleus interaction, resulting in a dominant
   hyperfine interaction over the electron spin-rotation coupling. The YO
   ground state is thus comprised of two manifolds of closely spaced
   states, with one of them possessing a negligible Lande g factor. This
   unique energy level structure favors dual-frequency dc magneto-optical
   trapping (MOT) and gray molasses cooling (GMC). We report exceptionally
   robust cooling of YO at 4 mu K over a wide range of laser intensity,
   detunings (one- and two-photon), and magnetic field. The magnetic
   insensitivity enables the spatial compression of the molecular cloud by
   alternating GMC and MOT under the continuous operation of the quadrupole
   magnetic field. A combination of these techniques produces a
   laser-cooled molecular sample with the highest phase space density in free space.},

Abstract = {V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted at the beginning of 2002 becoming an
   extremely luminous star with L similar or equal to 10(6)L(circle dot) .
   Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the outburst,
   the most promising is a stellar merger event. In this paper, we
   investigate the observational properties of the star and its
   surroundings in the post outburst phase. We have obtained a
   high-resolution optical spectrum of V838 Mon in 2005 October using the
   Keck I telescope. We have identified numerous atomic features and
   molecular bands present in the spectrum and provided an atlas of those
   features. In order to improve the spectrum interpretation, we have
   performed simple modeling of the molecular bands. Our analysis indicates
   that the spectrum is dominated by molecular absorption features arising
   in photospheric regions with temperatures of similar to 2400 K and in
   colder outer layers, where the temperature decreases to similar to 500
   K. A number of resonance lines of neutral alkali metals are observed to
   show P Cygni profiles. Particularly interesting are numerous prominent
   emission lines of {[}Fe II]. All of them show practically the same
   profile, which can be well described by a Lorentzian profile. In the
   blue part of the spectrum, photospheric signatures of the B-type
   companion are easily seen. We have fitted the observed spectrum with a
   synthetic one and the obtained parameters are consistent with the B3V
   type. We have also estimated radial and rotational velocities of the
   companion.},

Abstract = {We analyze spectra of V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr taken in 2004-2005 using
   the 6 m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory with the UAGS
   and SCORPIO spectrographs; the spectra have a resolution of 4.6 angstrom
   and a high signal-to-noise ratio. We confirm that V838 Mon is a spectral
   binary containing a B3V star and cool oxygen-rich star. We identify AlO,
   TiO, VO, ScO, BaO, ZrO, and YO molecular bands in the cool star's
   spectrum. The TiO absorption band at lambda 4423 angstrom overlaps the
   continuum of the hot B3V star, testifying that the hot star and its cool
   companion form a wide physical pair. Further evidence for the
   components' interaction is the presence of forbidden {[}Fell] lines that
   become stronger in the blue. We detected significant spectral
   variability of the cool star during 10 months in 2004. The spectrum of
   V4332 Sgr in 2005 (11 years after the outburst) contains emission lines
   of neutral metal atoms and of metal oxides against a photospheric
   continuum with a blackbody temperature of 2700 K. We identify the AlI,
   CaI, CrI, MnI, and SrI resonance lines and molecular emission lines of
   AlO, TiO, and VO, along with numerous emission lines of CrI in the
   spectrum. The MgI lambda 4571 angstrom intercombination line is present.
   The emission lines are formed in a large volume of cool low-density gas.
   We conclude based on spectroscopy combined with archive photographs and
   modern CCD photometry that both peculiar red novae were binaries prior
   to their outbursts, and contained blue hot components that exploded. The
   secondary of V838 Mon is a hot B3V star, and that of V4332 Sgr is a cool
   M7 star.},

   hyperfine interactions available has permitted a more thorough
   description of the electronic structure and charge distribution in these
   metal oxide molecules. An electronic structure comparison with the AlO,

Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {A spectroscopic study of the Rydberg states of YO accessed from
   particular rotational levels of the A (2)Pi(1/2), v=0 state has been
   combined with a pulsed field ionization, zero electron kinetic energy
   (PFI-ZEKE) investigation. The results provide accurate values of the
   ionization energy of YO, ionization energy I.E.(YO)=49 304.316(31)
   cm(-1) {[}6.112 958(4) eV], and of the rotational constant (and bond
   length) of the YO+ cation in its X (1)Sigma(+), v=0 ground state,
   B-0(+)=0.4078(3) cm(-1) {[}r(0)=1.7463(6) Angstrom]. The improved value
   of I.E.(YO) combined with the known ionization energy of atomic yttrium
   then leads to the result D-0(0)(Y-O)-D-0(0)(Y-O)=0.1041 +/- 0.0001 eV.
   Combining this result with the value of D-0(0)(Y+-O) obtained from
   guided ion beam mass spectrometry yields an improved value of
   D-0(0)(Y-O)=7.14 +/- 0.18 eV. The PFI-ZEKE spectra display an
   interesting channel-coupling effect so that all rotational levels with
   J(+)less than or equal to J(')(A)+0.5 are observed with high intensity,
   where J(+) is the angular momentum of the YO+ cation that is produced
   and J(')(A) is the angular momentum of the A (2)Pi(1/2) state that is
   reached when the first photon is absorbed. This is thought to result
   from the interaction between the dipole moment of the rotating YO+ core
   and the Rydberg electron, which can induce changes in l and J(+) subject
   to the dipolar coupling matrix element selection rule, Delta J(+)=+/- 1,
   Delta l=+/- 1. The channel-coupling mechanism also appears to induce an
   inverse autoionization process in which an unbound electron with a low
   value of l is captured either by its low-J(+) YO+ cation or by a second
   YO+ cation with the same value of J(+). This inverse autoionization
   process is extremely sensitive to the electron kinetic energy, leading
   to narrow peaks in the PFI-ZEKE spectrum which are only slightly broader
   than the laser linewidth employed for this study (0.25 cm(-1)).},

   During the initial expansion of YO in vacuum, the center-of-mass
   velocity and the expansion velocity increase with distance up to the
   boundary of the Knudsen layer. In the presence of oxygen, reactions of
   the ablated atomic species with oxygen take place, resulting in the
   formation of YO with broad velocity distribution. From the peak time of
   the observed TOF distributions, the most probable velocities of YO are
   found to be 2.6 km/s in vacuum, 2.2 km/s in 50 mTorr Ar, and 1.8 km/s in
   50 mTorr O-2, respectively. The dependence of the peak time on distance

   due to matrix lines and oxide radicals (LuO or YO) that emit band
   spectra depending on the excitation temperature (T-exc.) in ICP were

   at low and high fluences on YO indicate that there are very large
   differences in the `'temperatures'' inferred between the translational

   distributions of YO are observed to fit a shifted Boltzmann distribution

   fluences of 5 J/cm2. Bimodal velocity distributions are observed for the
