abstract = {The electronic structure of the ground and excited states of the ZnS species has been investigated by variational multireference and, in some cases, coupled-cluster techniques employing augmented basis sets of quintuple-ζ quality. Full potential energy curves are reported for 18 states. The nature of the bonding for the lowest electronic states is discussed in some detail. }
