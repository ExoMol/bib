Abstract = {{A detailed line list of spectroscopic transitions between the triplet
   states of the ZrS molecule at high temperature is presented. Transitions
   were calculated between the rotational and vibrational energy levels of
   the five triplet states (1)(3)Delta, (1)(3)Pi, (2)(3)Pi, (1)(3)Phi, and
   (1)(3)Sigma(+). The potential energy curves were calculated by using the
   method of Multireference Configuration Interaction (MRSDCI). In the
   calculations we used the augmented basis set aug-cc-pVQZ-PP with
   relativistic effective core potentials (ECPs). Spin-orbit calculations
   were then included by using a spin-orbit pseudo-potential (ECP) for
   zirconium and the Breit-Pauli operator for sulfur. The obtained ab
   initio potential energy curves were corrected by fitting to experimental
   results. Permanent and transition dipole moments were further computed
   in MRSDCI+Q calculations. These calculations were then used to obtain an
   accurate absorption line list of hot ZrS up to a temperature of 4000 K.
   The calculated spectroscopic line list is formed from over 7.5 million
   transitions between almost 22 619 rovibrational energy levels. The
   calculated line lists have a frequency range between 0 and 20 000 cm(-1)
   formed by including all transitions within the lowest five triplet
   states. To investigate the effect of temperature on the spectrum we
   calculated the partition function within the temperature range 10 to
   4000 K. The presented line list is the most complete list available for
   the triplet states of ZrS at high temperature. The presentwork should
   help to identify the spectrum of gaseous ZrS in cool stars and
   exoplanetary atmospheres.}},

Full potential energy curves are reported for 18 states. The nature of the bonding for the lowest electronic states is discussed in some detail. }
