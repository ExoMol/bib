Abstract = {ZrO has many low-lying states, and its spectra are essential for the
   characterization of S-type stars. A high-resolution emission spectrum
   recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer at the National Solar
   Observatory is used for the analysis. The 0-0 and 1-0 bands of the f3
   Delta-a3 Delta system (alpha system) and the 0-0 band of the e3 Pi-a3
   Delta system (beta system) have been rotationally analyzed using the
   modern spectral fitting program PGOPHER. New ab initio calculations of
   transition dipole moments have been performed to determine the band
   strengths. These band strengths are used to produce line lists that are
   suitable for the simulation of stellar spectra.},

Abstract = {ZrO is a well-studied metal monoxide because of its astrophysical
   importance in characterizing S stars. The bands of the d 3 Phi-a3 Delta
   system (gamma system) with v `<= 4 and v `' <= 5 are rotationally
   analyzed using the PGOPHER program to provide spectroscopic constants.
   The high-resolution ZrO emission spectrum was recorded with a Fourier
   transform spectrometer using a high-temperature carbon furnace source.
   New ab initio calculations of the transition dipole moment were carried
   out in order to determine the vibronic band strengths. The spectroscopic
   constants, along with the band strengths, are used to calculate a line
   list for the gamma system. This line list can be used to determine Zr
   abundances in S stars. We also correct the line strengths for the B 1
   Pi-A 1 Delta transition calculated in our previous work.},

A total of 21 rovibronic bands with v″ ≤ 7 and  were observed and fit for the B 1Π–X 1Σ+ transition, five bands for the 90ZrO B 1Π–A 1Δ transition and one band for the 90ZrO C 1Σ+–X 1Σ+ transition. All band systems were analyzed using high-temperature, high-resolution emission spectra collected at the National Solar Observatory (Kitt Peak). A modern spectroscopic analysis was performed using the PGOPHER program to provide updated spectroscopic constants. In general, we improve the accuracy of the line positions reported in the literature and slightly extend the vibrational analysis. Equilibrium molecular constants were then derived and combined with new ab initio calculations of transition dipole moment functions to produce line lists with line strengths.}

Title = {{Full spectroscopic model and trihybrid
   experimental-perturbative-variational line list for ZrO}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {524},
Pages = {4631-4641},
Abstract = {Zirconium monoxide (ZrO) absorption lines define rare S-type stars and
   are currently being sought on exoplanets. Successful detection is
   dependent on an accurate and comprehensive line list, with existing data
   not ideal for many applications. Specifically, the Plez et al. line list
   is near-complete but has insufficient accuracy for high-resolution
   cross-correlation, while the Sorensen \& Bernath data have high accuracy
   but only consider a small number of spectral bands. This article
   presents a novel spectroscopic model, variational line list, and
   trihybrid line list for the main (ZrO)-Zr-90-O-16 isotopologue, as well
   as isotopologue-extrapolated hybrid line lists for the (ZrO)-Zr-91-O-16,
   (ZrO)-Zr-92-O-16, (ZrO)-Zr-93-O-16, (ZrO)-Zr-94-O-16, and
   (ZrO)-Zr-96-O-16 isotopologues. These were constructed using Duo based
   on icMRCI-SD/CASSCF ab initio electronic data calculated using molpro,
   experimental energies obtained from a previous MARVEL data compilation,
   and perturbative energies from Sorensen \& Bernath. The new
   (ZrO)-Zr-90-O-16 ExoMol-style trihybrid line list, ZorrO, comprises 227
   118 energies (13 075 experimental) and 47 662 773 transitions up to 30
   000 cm (-1) (333 nm) between 10 low-lying electronic states (X (1)\&
   sigma;(+), a (3)\& UDelta;, A (1)\& UDelta;, b (3)\& pi;, B (1)\& pi;, C
   (1)\& sigma;(+), d (3)\& phi;, e (3)\& pi;, f (3)\& UDelta;, and F (1)\&
   UDelta;). The inclusion of experimental energy levels in ZorrO means ZrO
   will be much easier to detect using high-resolution ground-based
   telescopes in the 12 500-17 500 cm(-1) (571-800 nm) spectral region. The
   inclusion of variational energy levels means that the ZorrO line list
   has very high completeness and can accurately model molecular absorption
   cross-sections even at high temperatures. The ZorrO data will hopefully
   facilitate the first detection of ZrO in the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter
   exoplanet, or alternatively more conclusively exclude its presence.},
