Abstract = {Correlation consistent basis sets have been optimized for accurately
describing core-core and core-valence correlation effects with explicitly correlated
F12 methods. The new sets, denoted cc-pCVnZ-F12 (n=D, T, Q) and aug-cc-pC(F12)VnZ
(n=D, T, Q, 5), were developed by augmenting the cc-pVnZ-F12 and aug-cc-pVnZ families
of basis sets with additional functions whose exponents were optimized based on
the difference between all-electron and valence-electron correlation energies.
The number of augmented functions added is fewer, in general, than in the standard
cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ families of basis sets. Optimal values of the geminal Slater
exponent for use with these basis sets in MP2-F12 calculations are presented and
are also recommended for CCSD-F12b calculations. Auxiliary basis sets for use in
the resolution of the identity approximation in explicitly correlated calculations
have also been optimized and matched to the new cc-pCVnZ-F12 series of orbital
basis sets. The cc-pCVnZ-F12 basis sets, along with the new auxiliary sets, were
benchmarked in CCSD(T)-F12b calculations of spectroscopic properties on a series
of homo- and heteronuclear first and second row diatomic molecules. Comparing the
effects of correlating the outer core electrons in these molecules with those from
conventional CCSD(T) at the complete basis set limit, which involved calculations
with new cc-pCV6Z basis sets for the second row elements that were also developed
in the course of this work, it is observed that the F12 values are reasonably well
converged already at just the triple-zeta level. (c) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {Accurate extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit of valence
correlation energies calculated with explicitly correlated MP2-F12 and CCSD(T)-F12b
methods have been investigated using a Schwenke-style approach for molecules
containing both first and second row atoms. Extrapolation coefficients that are
optimal for molecular systems containing first row elements differ from those
optimized for second row analogs, hence values optimized for a combined set of first
and second row systems are also presented. The new coefficients are shown to produce
excellent results in both Schwenke-style and equivalent power-law-based two-point
CBS extrapolations, with the MP2-F12/cc-pV(D,T)Z-F12 extrapolations producing an
average error of just 0.17 mE(h) with a maximum error of 0.49 for a collection of
23 small molecules. The use of larger basis sets, i.e., cc-pV(T,Q)Z-F12 and aug-cc-pV(Q,5)Z,
in extrapolations of the MP2-F12 correlation energy leads to average errors that
are smaller than the degree of confidence in the reference data (similar to 0.1 mE(h)).
The latter were obtained through use of very large basis sets in MP2-F12 calculations
on small molecules containing both first and second row elements. CBS limits obtained
from optimized coefficients for conventional MP2 are only comparable to the accuracy
of the MP2-F12/cc-pV(D,T)Z-F12 extrapolation when the aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z and aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z
basis sets are used. The CCSD(T)-F12b correlation energy is extrapolated as two
distinct parts: CCSD-F12b and (T). While the CCSD-F12b extrapolations with smaller
basis sets are statistically less accurate than those of the MP2-F12 correlation
energies, this is presumably due to the slower basis set convergence of the CCSD-F12b
method compared to MP2-F12. The use of larger basis sets in the CCSD-F12b extrapolations
produces correlation energies with accuracies exceeding the confidence in the reference
data (also obtained in large basis set F12 calculations). It is demonstrated that
the use of the 3C(D) Ansatz is preferred for MP2-F12 CBS extrapolations. Optimal
values of the geminal Slater exponent are presented for the diagonal, fixed amplitude
Ansatz in MP2-F12 calculations, and these are also recommended for CCSD-F12b calculations.},

Abstract = {The theory and implementation of approximate coupled-cluster (CC), in
particular approximate CC singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples methods, are
discussed for general single-determinant reference functions. While the extension
of iterative approximate models to the non-Hartree-Fock case is straightforward,
the generalization of perturbative approaches is not trivial. In contrast to the
corresponding perturbative triples methods, there are additional terms required
for non-Hartree Fock reference functions, and there are several possibilities to
derive approximations to these terms. As it turns out impossible to develop an
approach that is consistent with the canonical Hartree Fock- based theory, several
new approximations have been implemented and their performance for total energies
and heats of formation has been assessed. The numerical results show that the
performance of the methods does not depend strongly on the approximations assumed.
Furthermore, the new perturbative quadruples methods, when applied to canonical
Hartree-Fock reference functions, outperform at least for absolute energies the
existing ones without increasing the computational costs. (C) 2008 American Institute

Abstract = {The possibilities for the approximate treatment of higher excitations

of corresponding approximations to lower-level CC methods are analyzed for higher
excitations. A general string-based algorithm is presented for the evaluation of
the special contractions appearing in the equations specific to those approximate

and that the coding effort is mostly reduced to the generation of the corresponding
formulas. The performance of the proposed and implemented methods for total energies
is assessed with special regard to quadruple and pentuple excitations. The applicability
of our approach is illustrated by benchmark calculations for the butadiene molecule.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables us to consider the effect
of quadruple excitations for molecular systems consisting of up to 10-12 atoms. (c)

   The first-order wavefunction is expanded in terms of the union of internally contracted

   of the theory with respect to unitary rotations of the reference functions. The method
   yields improved potentials in the vicinity of avoided crossings and conical intersections.
   The theory for computing nuclear energy gradients for MS-CASPT2 and XMS-CASPT2 is also
   presented and the first implementation of these gradient methods is reported. A number

Abstract = {Structures, accurate relative energies, equilibrium and vibrationally
   averaged rotational constants, quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion
   constants, dipole moments, N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants,
   anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and double-harmonic infrared
   intensities have been determined from ab initio electronic structure
   computations for conformers of the neutral form of the natural amino
   acid L-cysteine (Cys). A systematic scan located 71 unique conformers of
   Cys using the MP2(FC)/cc-pVTZ method. The large number of structurally
   diverse low-energy conformers of Cys necessitates the highest possible
   levels of electronic structure theory to determine their relative
   energies with some certainty. For this reason, we determined the
   relative energies of the lowest-energy eleven conformers, accurate
   within a standard error (11 or) of about 0.3 kJ mol(-1), through
   first-principles composite focal-point analyses (FPA), which employed
   extrapolations using basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z and
   correlation treatments as extensive as CCSD(T). Three and eleven
   conformers Of L-cysteine fall within a relative energy of 6 and 10 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. The vibrationally averaged rotational constants
   computed in this study agree well with Fourier-transform microwave
   spectroscopy results. The effects determining the relative energies of
   the low-energy conformers of cysteine are analyzed in detail on the
   basis of hydrogen bond additivity schemes and natural bond orbital
   analysis.},

   abstract = {In an attempt to improve on our earlier W3 theory [A. D. Boese et al.,
   J. Chem. Phys. 120, 4129 (2004)] we consider such refinements as more accurate
   estimates for the contribution of connected quadruple excitations (T̂ 4), inclusion
   of connected quintuple excitations (T̂ 5), diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (DBOC),
   and improved basis set extrapolation procedures. Revised experimental data for
   validation purposes were obtained from the latest version of the Active Thermochemical
   Tables thermochemical network. The recent CCSDT(Q) method offers a cost-effective
   way of estimating T̂ 4, but is insufficient by itself if the molecule exhibits
   some nondynamical correlation. The latter considerably slows down basis set
   convergence for T̂ 4, and anomalous basis set convergence in highly polar systems
   makes two-point extrapolation procedures unusable. However, we found that the
   CCSDTQ−CCSDT(Q) difference converges quite rapidly with the basis set, and that
   the formula 1.10[CCSDT(Q)∕cc-pVTZ+CCSDTQ∕cc-pVDZ-CCSDT(Q)∕cc-pVDZ] offers a
   very reliable as well as fairly cost-effective estimate of the basis set limit
   T̂ 4 contribution. The T̂ 5 contribution converges very rapidly with the basis
   set, and even a simple double-zeta basis set appears to be adequate. The largest T̂ 5
   contribution found in the present work is on the order of 0.5kcal∕mol (for ozone).
   DBOCs are significant at the 0.1kcal∕mol level in hydride systems. Post-CCSD(T)
   contributions to the core-valence correlation energy are only significant at that
   level in systems with severe nondynamical correlation effects. Based on the
   accumulated experience, a new computational thermochemistry protocol for first-
   and second-row main-group systems, to be known as W4 theory, is proposed. Its
   computational cost is not insurmountably higher than that of the earlier W3
   theory, while performance is markedly superior. Our W4 atomization energies
   for a number of key species are in excellent agreement (better than 0.1kcal∕mol
   on average, 95% confidence intervals narrower than 1kJ∕mol) with the latest
   experimental data obtained from Active Thermochemical Tables. Lower-cost variants
   are proposed: the sequence W1→W2.2→W3.2→W4lite→W4 is proposed as a converging
   hierarchy of computational thermochemistry methods. A simple a priori estimate
   for the importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation contributions (and hence a
   pessimistic estimate for the error in a W2-type calculation) is proposed},

	basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard
	correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the
	exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized
	with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence--electron
	correlated calculations, i.e., for the core--core plus core--valence
	correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets,
	which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first
	row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103,
	4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence
	to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set
	limit, the intershell (core--valence) correlation energy converges
	more slowly than the intrashell (core--core) correlation energy.
	Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation
	of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core--valence correlation
	effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions
	was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions
	to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just
	the core--valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a
	small amount of core--core correlation energy was included in order
	to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit.
	These new sets, denoted weighted core--valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ),
	significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties
	with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also
	developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ
	basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations
	on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al2, Si2,
	P2, S2, and Cl2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving

theory with variationally optimized orbitals. The simplest member of this hierarchy
involves connected double excitations within the variationally optimized valence
active space and may be denoted as VOO-CCD, or VOD. VOO-CCD is size-consistent,
has computational complexity proportional to the sixth power of molecule size,
and is expected to accurately approximate the nondynamical correlation energy in
such cases as single bond dissociation, diradicals, and anti-ferromagnetic coupling.
We report details of our implementation of VOO-CCD and illustrate that it does
indeed accurately recover the nondynamical correlation energy for challenging
multireference problems such as the torsion of ethylene and chemical bond breaking.},

  abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations
  have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf,
  Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived
  from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of
  molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation
  effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian
  functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the
  exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations,
  although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be
  taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is
  used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive
  basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of
  Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in
  correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first
  row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations,
  it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating
  functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent
  basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all
  functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of
  the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g],
  consistently yield 99% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding
  ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50% more primitive functions and twice
  as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields
  94%–97% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

  abstract = {A density matrix formulation of the super-CI MCSCF method is presented.
  The MC expansion is assumed to be complete in an active subset of the orbital space,
  and the corresponding CI secular problem is solved by a direct scheme using the unitary
  group approach. With a density matrix formulation the orbital optimization step becomes
  independent of the size of the CI expansion. It is possible to formulate the super-CI in
  terms of density matrices defined only in the small active subspace; the doubly occupied
  orbitals (the inactive subspace) do not enter. Further, in the unitary group formalism it
  is straightforward and simple to obtain the necessary density matrices from the symbolic
  formula list. It then becomes possible to treat very long MC expansions, the largest so
  far comprising 726 configurations. The method is demonstrated in a calculation of the
  potential curves for the three lowest states (1Σ+g, 3Σ+u and 3Πg) of the N2 molecule,
  using a medium-sized gaussian basis set. Seven active orbitals were used yielding the
  following results: De: 8.76 (9.90), 2.43 (3.68) and 3.39 (4.90) eV; re: 1.108 (1.098),
  1.309 (1.287) and 1.230 (1.213) Å; ωe: 2333 (2359), 1385 (1461) and 1680 (1733) cm−1,
  for the three states (experimental values within parentheses). The results of these
  calculations indicate that it is important to consider not only the dissociation limit
  but also the united atom limit in partitioning the occupied orbital space into an
  active and an inactive part.},
