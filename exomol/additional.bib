abstract = "The spectroscopic database HITEMP 2010 is used to upgrade
the parameters of the statistical molecular
band model which is part of the infrared signature prediction code
NIRATAM (NATO InfraRed Air TArget Model).
This band model was recommended by NASA and is applied in several
codes that determine the infrared emission of combustion gases.
The upgrade regards spectral absorption coefficients and line
densities of the gases H2O, CO2, and CO in the spectral region
400-5000 ( 2 25)
with a spectral resolution of xxx. The temperature range 100--3000K is covered.
Two methods to update the database are presented: the usually applied
method as provided in the literature
and an alternative, more laborious procedure that employs least
squares fitting. The achieved improvements
resulting from both methods are demonstrated by comparisons of
radiance spectra obtained from the band model
 to line-by-line results. The performance in a realistic scenario is
investigated on the basis
 of measured and predicted spectra of a jet aircraft plume in afterburner mode."

Title = {A grid of MARCS model atmospheres for late-type stars},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {486},
Pages = {951-970},
Abstract = {Context. In analyses of stellar spectra and colours, and for the
   analysis of integrated light from galaxies, a homogeneous grid of model
   atmospheres of late-type stars and corresponding flux spectra is needed.
   Aims. We construct an extensive grid of spherically-symmetric models
   (supplemented with plane-parallel ones for the highest surface
   gravities), built on up-to-date atomic and molecular data, and make it
   available for public use.
   Methods. The most recent version of the MARCS program is used.
   Results. We present a grid of about 104 model atmospheres for stars with
   2500K <= T(eff) <= 8000 K, -1 <= log g = log (GM/R(2)) <= 5 (cgs) with
   various masses and radii, -5 <= {[}Me/H] <= + 1, with {[}alpha/Fe] = 0.0
   and 0.4 and different choices of C and N abundances. This includes
   ``CN-cycled{''} models with C/N=4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging
   from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R,
   S and N, and with 1.0 <= xi(t) = 5km s(-1). We also list thermodynamic
   quantities (T, P(g), P(e), rho, partial pressures of molecules, etc.)
   and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated fluxes in
   approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in
   addition to 1D stratification (spherical or plane-parallel) include
   hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local
   thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of
   the models, in particular in relation to the effects of changing
   abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and
   negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We
   compare the models with those of other available grids and find
   excellent agreement with planeparallel models of Castelli \& Kurucz (if
   convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter
   range. Although there are considerable departures from the
   spherically-symmetric NextGen models, the agreement with more recent
   PHOENIX models is gratifying.
   Conclusions. The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but
   some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest
   models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of
   approximate ``rules of thumb{''} concerning effects of blanketing and
   sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some
   interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the
   intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong
   effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further
   details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of
   models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.}}

leading inverse-power terms in the long-range potential is introduced and applied to a recently reported data set for the ground state of Ca2. the new function yields an accurate representation of data which span 99.97% of the well depth and involves only a fraction as many (between 1/3 and 2/3 fewer) parameters as were needed to define published potential functions for these systems based on the same data. Fits using this form also allow a robust determination of the dissociation energy and C. 6 dispersion coefficient, and the resulting function is easier to use than other potential functions which have been determined for this system. }

Recent experimental and theoretical papers concerned with matrix shift phenomena are also discussed. The vibrational fundamentals of most molecules appear at somewhat lower frequencies in an argon matrix than in a neon matrix. Distributions of the matrix shifts have been obtained for stretching, hydrogen-stretching, and bending fundamentals. Neon-matrix shifts are typically smaller than argon-matrix shifts. There is a slight tendency for stretching vibrations observed in an argon matrix to lie below the gas-phase band centers."
