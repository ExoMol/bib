abstract = {The precision of modern length interferometry and geodetic surveying far exceeds the accuracy, which is ultimately limited by the inadequacy of currently used equations for the refractive index of the atmosphere. I have critically reviewed recent research at the National Physical Laboratory, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and elsewhere that has led to revised formulas and data for the dispersion and density of the major components of the atmosphere. I have combined selected formulas from these sources to yield a set of equations that match recently reported measurements to within the experimental error, and that are expected to be reliable over very wide ranges of atmospheric parameters and wavelength.},
