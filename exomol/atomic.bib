Abstract = {{We present results of extensive configuration interaction calculations
   of absorption oscillator strengths for transitions in Mn II from the
   ground a S-7(3) state to the lower P-7(J)o and P-5(J)o, states. Of
   particular importance are the weak transitions to the y P-7(J)o and x
   P-7(J)o levels, which themselves strongly interact. These weaker lines
   are important in determining the interstellar abundance of Mn. We have
   also extended these calculations to examine intercombination lines of
   the form S-7(3) - P-5(J)o.}},

Abstract = {{Individual orbital optimization of wave functions for the initial and
   final states produces the most accurate wave functions for given
   expansions, but complicates the calculation of transition-matrix
   elements since the two sets of orbitals will be nonorthogonal. The
   orbital sets can be transformed to become biorthonormal, in which case
   the evaluation of any matrix element can proceed as in the orthonormal
   case. The transformation of the wave-function expansion to the new basis
   imposes certain requirements on the wave function, depending on the type
   of transformation. An efficient and general method was found a few years
   ago for expansions in determinants, spin-coupled configurations, or
   configuration state functions for molecules belonging to the D-2h point
   group or its subgroups. The method requires only that the expansions are
   closed under deexcitation and thus applies to restricted active space
   wave functions. This type of expansion is efficient for correlation
   studies and includes many types of expansions as special cases. The
   above technique has been generalized to the atomic, symmetry adapted
   case requiring the treatment of degenerate shells nl(N), with arbitrary
   occupation numbers 0 less than or equal to N less than or equal to 4l+2.
   A computer implementation of the algorithm in the multiconfiguration
   Hartree-Fock atomic-structure package for atoms allows the calculation
   of transition moments for individually optimized states. An application
   is presented for the BI 1s(2)2s(2)2P(2)P(o)-->1s(2)2s2p(22)D electric
   dipole transition probability, which is highly sensitive to
   core-polarization effects.}},
