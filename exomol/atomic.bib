Title = {New theoretical study of potassium perturbed by He and a comparison to
   laboratory spectra},
Journal =AA,
Year = {2024},
Volume = {683},
Abstract = {The visible and near-infrared spectra of late L- and T-type dwarf stars
   are dominated in large part by the resonance lines of neutral Na and K.
   It is the collision broadening of these atomic lines by H-2 and He in
   the stellar atmosphere that determines the continuum from below 0.5 mu m
   to above 0.9 mu m in the spectrum. Their line profiles can be detected
   as far as 3000 cm(-1) from the line center in T dwarfs and consequently
   an accurate and detailed determination of the complete profile,
   including the extreme far wing, is required to model the contribution of
   these strong alkali resonance lines to brown dwarf spectra. We report on
   our new calculations of unified line profiles of K perturbed by He using
   ab initio potential data for the conditions prevailing in cool
   substellar brown dwarfs and hot dense planetary atmospheres with
   temperatures from T-eff = 500 to 3000 K. For such objects with
   atmospheres of H-2 and He, conventional laboratory absorption
   spectroscopy can be used to examine the line wings and test the line
   shape theories and molecular potentials. We find that an analytical
   Lorentzian profile is useful for a few cm(-1) from the line center, but
   not in the line wings, where the radiative transfer is a consequence of
   the K-He radiative collisions that are sensitive to the interaction
   potentials. Tables of the K-He absorption coefficients of the resonance
   lines allow accurate model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. For this
   purpose, we present new opacities from comprehensive line shape theory
   incorporating accurate ab initio potentials. Use of these new tables for
   the modeling of emergent spectra will be an improvement over previous
   line shape approximations based on incomplete or inaccurate potentials.
   We also present Lorentzian impact parameters obtained in the
   semi-classical and quantum theory for the K 4s - 4p resonance line
   centered at 0.77 mu m specifically for the line core regime.},

It is found that Li-rich stars [log € (Li) \\&gt; 1] usually have low 12C/13C ratios ( \\&lt; 15). The great majority of the Li-rich and low 12C/13C stars are of J type, although this correlation can also be found in normal (N-type) C stars. If these stars were indeed low-mass C stars, these results would require the existence of a deep- mixing mechanism able to operate in low-mass (M≲ 2 M⊙) C stars as an alternative for Li production by the hot bottom burning mechanism proposed in asymptotic giant branch stars with larger mass. We show observational evidence suggesting that high mass loss appears to act against such a mechanism.}",

Title = {TRANSITION-PROBABILITY CALCULATIONS FOR ATOMS USING NONORTHOGONAL
   ORBITALS},
Journal = {Phys. Rev. E},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {4499-4508},
Abstract = {{Individual orbital optimization of wave functions for the initial and
   final states produces the most accurate wave functions for given
   expansions, but complicates the calculation of transition-matrix
   elements since the two sets of orbitals will be nonorthogonal. The
   orbital sets can be transformed to become biorthonormal, in which case
   the evaluation of any matrix element can proceed as in the orthonormal
   case. The transformation of the wave-function expansion to the new basis
   imposes certain requirements on the wave function, depending on the type
   of transformation. An efficient and general method was found a few years
   ago for expansions in determinants, spin-coupled configurations, or
   configuration state functions for molecules belonging to the D-2h point
   group or its subgroups. The method requires only that the expansions are
   closed under deexcitation and thus applies to restricted active space
   wave functions. This type of expansion is efficient for correlation
   studies and includes many types of expansions as special cases. The
   above technique has been generalized to the atomic, symmetry adapted
   case requiring the treatment of degenerate shells nl(N), with arbitrary
   occupation numbers 0 less than or equal to N less than or equal to 4l+2.
   A computer implementation of the algorithm in the multiconfiguration
   Hartree-Fock atomic-structure package for atoms allows the calculation
   of transition moments for individually optimized states. An application
   is presented for the BI 1s(2)2s(2)2P(2)P(o)-->1s(2)2s2p(22)D electric
   dipole transition probability, which is highly sensitive to
   core-polarization effects.}},
