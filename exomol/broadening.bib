Title = {Ab Initio Quantum Dynamics as a Scalable Solution to the Exoplanet
   Opacity Challenge: A Case Study of {CO$_2$} in a Hydrogen
   Atmosphere},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {981},
Abstract = {Light-matter interactions lie at the heart of our exploration of
   exoplanetary atmospheres. Interpreting data obtained by remote sensing
   is enabled by meticulous, time- and resource-consuming work aiming at
   deepening our understanding of such interactions (i.e., opacity models).
   Recently, P. Niraula et al. pointed out that due primarily to
   limitations on our modeling of broadening and far-wing behaviors,
   opacity models needed a timely update for exoplanet exploration in the
   JWST era, and thus argued for a scalable approach. In this
   proof-of-concept study, we introduce an end-to-end solution from ab
   initio calculations to pressure broadening, and use a perturbation
   framework to address the need for precision to a level of similar to
   10\%. We focus on the CO2-H2 system as CO2 is a key absorption feature
   for exoplanet research (primarily in many gas giants) at similar to 4.3
   mu m as pressure-broadening parameters required for interpreting such
   observations remain sparse. We compute elastic and inelastic cross
   sections for the collisions of ortho-H2 with CO2, in the ground
   vibrational state, and at the coupled-channel fully converged level. For
   scattering energies above similar to 20 cm-1, moderate precision
   intermolecular potentials are indistinguishable from high-precision ones
   in cross sections. Our calculations agree with the currently available
   measurements within 7\%, i.e., well beyond the precision requirements.},

Title = {Experimental study on mid-infrared CO transition lines broadened by N2,
   He, and H2 at elevated temperatures},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {242},
Abstract = {Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) has been established
   as a strong technique for high-fidelity measurements at elevated
   temperatures. However, the accuracy of the measured data using TDLAS
   depends on the accuracy of the spectroscopic parameters. In this paper,
   the N2-, He-, and H2-perturbed collisional broadening coefficients of
   the CO P(0, 21), P(1, 21), and P(0, 37) lines were measured at 1040-2980
   K. Ar-diluted mixtures were applied to measure these spectroscopic
   parameters at elevated temperatures up to 3000 K. Validation experiments
   highlighted that the measured temperatures and CO concentrations agreed
   well with the known values under thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium
   conditions. Comparisons of residuals in Voigt fitting highlighted that
   the N2-perturbed Dicke narrowing effects are stronger than the He- and
   H2-perturbed phenomena. The differences among species-perturbed
   high-temperature collisional broadening coefficients for the three
   transition lines were found to be closely related to the intermolecular
   forces and effective collision crosssections.},

Journal = JQSRT,

Abstract = {The amount of water vapor in the terrestrial atmosphere is highly
  variable both spatially and temporally. In the tropics it sometimes
  constitutes 4-5\% of the atmosphere. At the same time collisional
  broadening of spectral lines by water vapor is much larger than that by
  nitrogen and oxygen. Therefore, in order to accurately characterize and
  model spectra of the atmospheres with significant amounts of water
  vapor, the line-shape parameters for spectral lines broadened by water
  vapor are required. In this work, the pressure-broadening parameters
  (and their temperature-dependent exponents) due to the pressure of water
  vapor for spectral lines of CO2, N2O, CO, CH4, O-2, NH3, and H2S from
  both experimental and theoretical studies were collected and carefully
  reviewed. A set of semiempirical models based on these collected data
  was proposed and then used to estimate water broadening and its
  temperature dependence for all transitions of selected molecules in the
  HITRAN2016 database.},
