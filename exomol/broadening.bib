  II. Line Lists of CO2, N2O, CO, SO2, OH, OCS, H2CO, HCN, PH3, H2S, and
  GeH4},

Abstract = {In recent years, extended efforts have been made to increase the
  potential for modeling and interpreting the spectra of planetary
  atmospheres using the HITRAN database. A significant objective is to
  provide broadening parameters due to the ambient pressure of He, H-2,
  and CO2 gases. Since hydrogen and helium are the main constituents in
  the atmospheres of gas giants, and carbon dioxide dominates the
  atmospheres of many rocky planets, these spectroscopic data are
  essential for radiative transfer models dedicated to planetary
  atmospheres. In HITRAN2016, the He-, H-2- and CO2-broadening parameters
  and their temperature dependencies, and in some cases pressure-induced
  shifts, were added to the line lists of CO, SO2, NH3, HF, HCl, OCS, and
  C2H2. This work describes a further expansion introduced in the
  HITRAN2020 edition. In particular, relevant data for the line lists of
  CO2, N2O, OH, H2CO, HCN, PH3, H2S, and GeH4 were added, while those for
  CO, SO2, and OCS were revised. The new data are based on the
  semiempirical models constructed on available and validated experimental
  measurements and theoretical predictions. These models strongly depend
  on the extent and quality of the available data. The paper explains how
  to use the online interface or the HITRAN Application Programming
  Interface (HAPI) to retrieve these data from the database. Examples of
  calculating a molecule's spectra in a mixture of buffer-gases using HAPI
  are also provided. We also provide a set of Python codes allowing one to
  populate any line list of corresponding molecules with relevant
  broadening parameters.},

Title = {The first comprehensive dataset of beyond-Voigt line-shape parameters
  from ab initio quantum scattering calculations for the HITRAN database:
  He-perturbed H-2 case study},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {260},
Abstract = {We demonstrate a new method for populating line-by-line spectroscopic
  databases with beyond-Voigt line-shape parameters, which is based on ab
  initio quantum scattering calculations. We report a comprehensive
  dataset for the benchmark system of He-perturbed H-2 (we cover all the
  rovibrational bands that are present in the HITRAN spectroscopic
  database). We generate the entire dataset of the line-shape parameters
  (broadening and shift, their speed dependence, and the complex Dicke
  parameter) from fully ab initio quantum-scattering calculations. We
  extend the previous calculations by taking into account the centrifugal
  distortion for all the bands and by including the hot bands. The results
  are projected on a simple structure of the quadratic speed-dependent
  hard-collision profile. We report a simple and compact formula that
  allows the speed-dependence parameters to be calculated directly from
  the generalized spectroscopic cross sections. For each line and each
  line-shape parameter, we provide a full temperature dependence within
  the double-power-law (DPL) representation, which makes the dataset
  compatible with the HITRAN database. The temperature dependences cover
  the range from 20 to 1000 K, which includes the low temperatures
  relevant for the studies of the atmospheres of giant planets. The final
  outcome from our dataset is validated on highly accurate experimental
  spectra collected with cavity ring-down spectrometers. The methodology
  can be applied to many other molecular species important for atmospheric
  and planetary studies.},

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The amount of water vapor in the terrestrial atmosphere is highly
  variable both spatially and temporally. In the tropics it sometimes
  constitutes 4-5\% of the atmosphere. At the same time collisional
  broadening of spectral lines by water vapor is much larger than that by
  nitrogen and oxygen. Therefore, in order to accurately characterize and
  model spectra of the atmospheres with significant amounts of water
  vapor, the line-shape parameters for spectral lines broadened by water
  vapor are required. In this work, the pressure-broadening parameters
  (and their temperature-dependent exponents) due to the pressure of water
  vapor for spectral lines of CO2, N2O, CO, CH4, O-2, NH3, and H2S from
  both experimental and theoretical studies were collected and carefully
  reviewed. A set of semiempirical models based on these collected data
  was proposed and then used to estimate water broadening and its
  temperature dependence for all transitions of selected molecules in the
  HITRAN2016 database.},
