Abstract = {{Radiative heat transfer (RHT) is often the dominant mode of heat
   transfer in flames, fires, and combustion systems and affects
   significantly temperature distributions directly and kinetically
   controlled chemical processes indirectly. Modeling RHT accurately in
   multidimensional flames and combustion systems is challenging mainly due
   to the highly spectrally dependent radiative properties of combustion
   products, the high computational cost of solving the radiative transfer
   equation (RTE), and the strong turbulence and radiation interactions
   (TRI). Significant progress has been made in all three aspects in the
   last three decades and the state-of-the-art models and methods have been
   incorporated into CFD practice for modeling fires, turbulent jet flames,
   and turbulent combustion in combustion systems. In this article, we
   first discuss the coupling between RHT and combustion and the important
   role played by RHT in some fundamental flame phenomena. Then we discuss
   the state-of-theart radiation models with a focus on RTE solvers,
   radiative property models and TRI. Next, we review the recent
   simulations of turbulent combustion systems involving these
   state-of-the-art radiation models. Finally, we provide concluding
   remarks and some potential research areas to advance RHT modeling in
   multiphase reacting flows.}},
