Title = {{The source of electrons at comet 67P}},

Pages = {5041-5065},
Abstract = {We examine the origin of electrons in a weakly outgassing comet, using
   Rosetta mission data and a 3D collisional model of electrons at a comet.
   We have calculated a new data set of electron-impact ionization (EII)
   frequency throughout the Rosetta escort phase, with measurements of the
   Rosetta Plasma Consortium's Ion and Electron Sensor (RPC/IES). The EII
   frequency is evaluated in 15-min intervals and compared to other Rosetta
   data sets. EII is the dominant source of electrons at 67P away from
   perihelion and is highly variable (by up to three orders of magnitude).
   Around perihelion, EII is much less variable and less efficient than
   photoionization at Rosetta. Several drivers of the EII frequency are
   identified, including magnetic field strength and the outgassing rate.
   Energetic electrons are correlated to the Rosetta-upstream solar wind
   potential difference, confirming that the ionizing electrons are solar
   wind electrons accelerated by an ambipolar field. The collisional test
   particle model incorporates a spherically symmetric, pure water coma and
   all the relevant electron-neutral collision processes. Electric and
   magnetic fields are stationary model inputs, and are computed using a
   fully kinetic, collision-less Particle-in-Cell simulation. Collisional
   electrons are modelled at outgassing rates of Q = 10(26) s(-1 )and Q =
   1.5 x 10(27) s(-1). Secondary electrons are the dominant population
   within a weakly outgassing comet. These are produced by collisions of
   solar wind electrons with the neutral coma. The implications of large
   ion flow speed estimates at Rosetta, away from perihelion, are discussed
   in relation to multi-instrument studies and the new results of the EII
   frequency obtained in this study.},

Title = {A collisional test-particle model of electrons at a comet},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2022},
Volume = {511},
Pages = {4090-4108},
Abstract = {We have developed the first 3D collisional model of electrons at a
   comet, which we use to examine the impact of electron-neutral collisions
   in the weakly outgassing regime. The test-particle Monte Carlo model
   uses electric and magnetic fields from a fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell
   (PiC) model as an input. In our model, electrons originate from the
   solar wind or from ionization of the neutral coma, either by electron
   impact or absorption of an extreme ultraviolet photon. All relevant
   electron-neutral collision processes are included in the model including
   elastic scattering, excitation, and ionization. Trajectories of
   electrons are validated against analytically known drifts and the
   stochastic energy degradation used in the model is compared to the
   continuous slowing down approximation. Macroscopic properties of the
   solar wind and cometary electron populations, such as density and
   temperature, are validated with simple known cases and via comparison
   with the collisionless PiC model. We demonstrate that electrons are
   trapped close to the nucleus by the ambipolar electric field, causing an
   increase in the efficiency of electron-neutral collisions. Even at a
   low-outgassing rate (Q = 10(26) s(-1)), electron-neutral collisions are
   shown to cause significant cooling in the coma. The model also provides
   a multistep numerical framework that is used to assess the influence of
   the electron-to-ion mass ratio, enabling access to electron dynamics
   with a physical electron mass.},

Title = {{A high-spectral-resolution catalog of emission lines in the visible
   spectrum of comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{656}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Aims. Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) is considered to be the brightest comet
   observed in the northern hemisphere since the passage of comet C/1995 O1
   (Hale-Bopp) in 1997. Since the study of comets offers a unique
   opportunity to investigate the early stages of the formation and
   evolution of our Sun and the Solar System, we obtained high-resolution
   optical spectra (R = lambda/Delta lambda = 11 5000) of comet NEOWISE.
   The unique passage and its brightness yielded spectra with a large
   number of emission lines, providing information on the coma composition
   and the physical and chemical processes occurring in the nucleus. The
   spectra have been used to generate a catalog of emission lines to be
   used for future studies of comets since there are no catalogs in the
   literature with such a high spectral resolution.
   Methods. Two high-resolution spectra of comet NEOWISE were obtained, on
   26 July 2020 (geocentric distance of 0.7 AU) and 5 August 2020
   (geocentric distance of 0.89 AU), with the High Accuracy Radial velocity
   Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N) echelle
   spectrograph installed on the 360 cm Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. The
   spectra cover the range between 383 and 693 nm, and have been extracted
   using the HARPS-N Data Reduction Pipeline. To analyze the spectra and
   compile the high-resolution catalog, we collected several laboratory
   molecular line lists that cover the same wavelength range as that of our
   spectra. To validate the final identification, we compared our catalog
   with other atlases that resulted from the spectral analysis of other
   comets.
   Results. We generate a high-spectral-resolution catalog of emission
   lines observed in comet NEOWISE, providing the identification for 4488
   lines. We found cometary lines due to CN, CH, C-2, C-3, and NH2 and
   atomic lines due to Nat and {[}OI].}},

Abstract = {{Surface material on a remote target can be characterized by using a
   spectrometer to view a laser-heated spot on the target surface through
   the plume of ejected material. The concept is described as Remote Laser
   Evaporative Molecular Absorption (R-LEMA) spectroscopy.(1,2) The
   proposed method is distinct from current stand-off approaches to
   composition analysis, such as Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy
   (LIBS), which atomizes and ionizes target material and observes emission
   spectra to determine bulk atomic composition. Initial simulations of
   R-LEMA absorption profiles based on theoretical models show great
   promise for the proposed method. This paper describes an experimental
   setup being developed to acquire R-LEMA spectra in the laboratory under
   controlled conditions that will allow comparison to theoretically
   predicted spectral profiles. A sample is placed in a vacuum space; a
   laser beam is directed at the sample, through an optical window. As the
   sample is heated, and evaporation begins, thermal emission from the
   heated spot passes through the molecular plume, then out of the vacuum
   space via infrared windows. The thermal emission is directed into a
   FT-IR spectrometer, which is equipped with a source-brightness
   comparator to correct for changes in source intensity during a scan.
   Targets of known composition are tested and laboratory measurements are
   compared to the theoretically predicted spectra. Laboratory spectra for
   composite targets are also presented, including terrestrial rocks and
   asteroid regolith simulant.}},

abstract = {In order to understand the cometary plasma environment it is important to track the closely linked chemical reactions that dominate ion evolution. We used a coupled MHD ion-chemistry model to analyze previously unpublished Giotto High Intensity Ion Mass Spectrometer (HIS-IMS) data. In this way we study the major species, but we also try to match some minor species like the CHx and the NHx groups. Crucial for this match is the model used for the electrons since they are important for ion–electron recombination. To further improve our results we included an enhanced density of supersonic electrons in the ion pile-up region which increases the local electron impact ionization. In this paper we discuss the results for the following important ions: C+, CH+, CH+2, CH+3, N+, NH+, NH+2, NH+3, NH+4, O+, OH+, H2O+, H3O+, CO+, HCO+, H3CO+, and CH3OH+2. We also address the inner shock which is very distinctive in our MHD model as well as in the IMS data. It is located just inside the contact surface at approximately 4550 km. Comparisons of the ion bulk flow directions and velocities from our MHD model with the data measured by the HIS-IMS give indication for a solar wind magnetic field direction different from the standard Parker angle at Halley's position. Our ion-chemical network model results are in a good agreement with the experimental data. In order to achieve the presented results we included an additional short lived inner source for the C+, CH+, and CH+2 ions. Furthermore we performed our simulations with two different production rates to better match the measurements which is an indication for a change and/or an asymmetric pattern (e.g. jets) in the production rate during Giotto's fly-by at Halley's comet.}

Abstract = {We present a comparative study on molecular abundances in comets based
   on millimetre/submillimetre observations made with the IRAM 30-m, JCMT,
   CSO and SEST telescopes. This study concerns a sample of 24 comets (6
   Jupiter-family, 3 Halley-family, 15 long-period) observed from 1986 to
   2001 and 8 molecular species (HCN, HNC, CH3CN, CH3OH, H2CO, CO, CS,
   H2S). HCN was detected in all comets, while at least 2 molecules were
   detected in 19 comets.
   From the sub-sample of comets for which contemporary H2O production
   rates are available, we infer that the HCN abundance relative to water
   varies from 0.08\% to 0.25\%. With respect to other species, HCN is the
   molecule which exhibits the lowest abundance variation from comet to
   comet. Therefore, production rates relative to that of HCN can be used
   for a comparative study of molecular abundances in the 19 comets. It is
   found that: CH3OH/HCN varies from less than or equal to9 to 64; CO/HCN
   varies from less than or equal to24 to 180; H2CO/HCN varies between 1.6
   and 10; and H2S/HCN varies between 1.5 and 7.6.
   This study does not show any clear correlation between the relative
   abundances and the dynamical origins of the comets, or their dust-to-gas
   ratios.},
