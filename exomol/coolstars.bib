Title = {{Chemical equilibrium in AGB atmospheres: successes, failures, and
   prospects for small molecules, clusters, and condensates}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{637}},
Abstract = {{Chemical equilibrium has proven extremely useful for predicting the
   chemical composition of AGB atmospheres. Here we use a recently
   developed code and an updated thermochemical database that includes
   gaseous and condensed species involving 34 elements to compute the
   chemical equilibrium composition of AGB atmospheres of M-, S-, and
   C-type stars. We include for the first time TixCy clusters, with x = 1-4
   and y = 1-4, and selected larger clusters ranging up to Ti13C22, for
   which thermochemical data are obtained from quantum-chemical
   calculations. Our main aims are to systematically survey the main
   reservoirs of each element in AGB atmospheres, review the successes and
   failures of chemical equilibrium by comparing it with the latest
   observational data, identify potentially detectable molecules that have
   not yet been observed, and diagnose the most likely gas-phase precursors
   of dust and determine which clusters might act as building blocks of
   dust grains. We find that in general, chemical equilibrium reproduces
   the observed abundances of parent molecules in circumstellar envelopes
   of AGB stars well. There are, however, severe discrepancies of several
   orders of magnitude for some parent molecules that are observed to be
   anomalously overabundant with respect to the predictions of chemical
   equilibrium. These are HCN, CS, NH3, and SO2 in M-type stars, H2O and
   NH3 in S-type stars, and the hydrides H2O, NH3, SiH4, and PH3 in C-type
   stars. Several molecules have not yet been observed in AGB atmospheres
   but are predicted with non-negligible abundances and are good candidates
   for detection with observatories such as ALMA. The most interesting ones
   are SiC5, SiNH, SiCl, PS, HBO, and the metal-containing molecules MgS,
   CaS, CaOH, CaCl, CaF, ScO, ZrO, VO, FeS, CoH, and NiS. In agreement with
   previous studies, the first condensates predicted to appear in C-rich
   atmospheres are found to be carbon, TiC, and SiC, while Al2O3 is the
   first major condensate expected in O-rich outflows. According to our
   chemical equilibrium calculations, the gas-phase precursors of carbon
   dust are probably acetylene, atomic carbon, and/or C-3, while for
   silicon carbide dust, the most likely precursors are the molecules SiC2
   and Si2C. In the case of titanium carbide dust, atomic Ti is the major
   reservoir of this element in the inner regions of AGB atmospheres, and
   therefore it is probably the main supplier of titanium during the
   formation of TiC dust. However, chemical equilibrium predicts that large
   titanium-carbon clusters such as Ti8C12 and Ti13C22 become the major
   reservoirs of titanium at the expense of atomic Ti in the region where
   condensation of TiC is expected to occur. This suggests that the
   assembly of large TixCy clusters might be related to the formation of
   the first condensation nuclei of TiC. In the case of Al2O3 dust,
   chemical equilibrium indicates that atomic Al and the carriers of Al-O
   bonds AlOH, AlO, and Al2O are the most likely gas-phase precursors.}},
