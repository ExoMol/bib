Abstract = {Context. Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photons are important drivers of
   chemical processes in space. Thus, it is important to accurately
   characterize and constrain photorates in different radiation fields, via
   the photodissociation and photoionization cross sections of individual
   atoms and molecules. These have been available in the Leiden VUV
   photodissocation and photoionization cross section database.
   Aims. Experimental and theoretical advances in the past decade or so
   have allowed multiple new cross sections to be obtained, particularly
   photoionization cross sections of radicals. The database is hereby
   updated by including these more recent cross sections and is also
   expanded with several astronomically relevant species.
   Methods. The cross sections have been used to calculate
   photodissociation and photoionization rates in several different
   radiation fields as well as from cosmic-ray-induced VUV fluxes. The
   reduction of rates in shielded regions was calculated as a function of
   dust, molecular and atomic hydrogen, atomic carbon, and self-shielding
   column densities. The relative importance of these shielding types is
   molecule and atom dependent, as well as the assumed dust absorbance. All
   the data are publicly available from the Leiden VUV cross section
   database.
   Results. The Leiden VUV cross section database has been updated with 14
   new astrophysically relevant molecular species and 16 updates to
   previous entries. The database update is accompanied by a brief review
   of the basic physical processes, particularly photoionization processes
   which have not been reviewed in the context of previous database
   updates.},
