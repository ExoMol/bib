Abstract = {Description of a large number of datasets related to gas-phase reaction
   kinetics (Re), high-resolution molecular spectroscopy (Spec), and
   thermochemistry (Th), called ReSpecTh, is presented. The datasets
   contain accurate and validated experimental, empirical, and computed,
   machine-searchable data, and, whenever possible, the corresponding
   metadata. ReSpecTh data and the accompanying utility codes can be used
   in several engineering and scientific fields either separately or
   simultaneously, such as simulation of combustion reactions, atmospheres
   of planets and exoplanets, and stellar and interstellar environments.},

	abstract = {The Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, CDMS, was founded 1998 to provide in its catalog section line lists of mostly molecular species which are or may be observed in various astronomical sources (usually) by radio astronomical means. The line lists contain transition frequencies with qualified accuracies, intensities, quantum numbers, as well as further auxiliary information. They have been generated from critically evaluated experimental line lists, mostly from laboratory experiments, employing established Hamiltonian models. Separate entries exist for different isotopic species and usually also for different vibrational states. As of December 2015, the number of entries is 792. They are available online as ascii tables with additional files documenting information on the entries. The Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre, VAMDC, was founded more than 5years ago as a common platform for atomic and molecular data. This platform facilitates exchange not only between spectroscopic databases related to astrophysics or astrochemistry, but also with collisional and kinetic databases. A dedicated infrastructure was developed to provide a common data format in the various databases enabling queries to a large variety of databases on atomic and molecular data at once. For CDMS, the incorporation in VAMDC was combined with several modifications on the generation of CDMS catalog entries. Here we introduce related changes to the data structure and the data content in the CDMS. The new data scheme allows us to incorporate all previous data entries but in addition allows us also to include entries based on new theoretical descriptions. Moreover, the CDMS entries have been transferred into a mySQL database format. These developments within the VAMDC framework have in part been driven by the needs of the astronomical community to be able to deal efficiently with large data sets obtained with the Herschel Space Telescope or, more recently, with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array.}

	abstract = {A new 626-based Ames-2 PES refinement and Ames-2016 line lists for 13 CO2 isotopologues are reported. A consistent σRMS=±0.02 cm−1 is established for hundreds of isotopologue band origins using the Ames-2 PES. Ames-2016 line lists are computed at 296K, 1000K and 4000K using the Ames-2 PES and the same DMS-N2 dipole surface used previously, with J up to 150, E′ up to 24,000 cm−1 or 18,000 cm−1 and appropriate intensity cutoffs. The lists are compared to the CDSD-296, CDSD-4000 databases, UCL line lists, and a few recent highly accurate CO2 intensity measurements. Both agreements and discrepancies are discussed. Compared to the old Ames CO2 lists, the Ames-2016 line lists have line position deviations reduced by 50% or more, which consequently leads to more reliable intensities. The line shape parameters in the Ames-2016 line lists are predicted using the newly assigned conventional vibrational polyad quantum numbers for rovibrational levels below 12,000 cm−1 so the quality of the line shape parameters is similar to that of CDSD or HITRAN. This study further proves that a semi-empirically refined PES (Ames-1 and Ames-2) coupled with a high quality ab initio DMS (DMS-N2 and UCL) may generate IR predictions with consistent accuracy and is thus helpful in the analysis of laboratory spectra and simulations of various isotopologues. The Ames-2016 lists based on DMS-N2 have reached the ∼1% intensity prediction accuracy level for the recent 626 30013-00001 and 20013-00001 bands, but further quantification and improvements require sub-percent or sub-half-percent accurate experimental intensities. The inter-isotopologue consistency of the intensity prediction accuracies should have reached better than 1–3% for regular bands not affected by resonances. Since the Effective Dipole Models (EDM) in CDSD and HITRAN have 1–20% or even larger uncertainties, we show that the Ames lists can provide better alternative IR data for many hard-to-determine isotopologue bands. Comparison at 4000K suggests that the Ames-4000K 12C16O2 line list is reliable and consistent within the current cutoffs of J ≤ 150 and E′ ≤ 24,000 cm−1, but intensity contributions involving higher energy levels should not be omitted and future computations need to be converged up to at least 32,000 cm−1 or higher. The remaining issues are discussed regarding the source of energy level discrepancies, intensity underestimations by ∼50% for some weak bands, etc. and also future work.}

Title = {Photodissociation and photoionization of molecules of astronomical
   interest Updates to the Leiden photodissociation and photoionization
   cross section database},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {675},
Abstract = {Context. Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photons are important drivers of
   chemical processes in space. Thus, it is important to accurately
   characterize and constrain photorates in different radiation fields, via
   the photodissociation and photoionization cross sections of individual
   atoms and molecules. These have been available in the Leiden VUV
   photodissocation and photoionization cross section database.
   Aims. Experimental and theoretical advances in the past decade or so
   have allowed multiple new cross sections to be obtained, particularly
   photoionization cross sections of radicals. The database is hereby
   updated by including these more recent cross sections and is also
   expanded with several astronomically relevant species.
   Methods. The cross sections have been used to calculate
   photodissociation and photoionization rates in several different
   radiation fields as well as from cosmic-ray-induced VUV fluxes. The
   reduction of rates in shielded regions was calculated as a function of
   dust, molecular and atomic hydrogen, atomic carbon, and self-shielding
   column densities. The relative importance of these shielding types is
   molecule and atom dependent, as well as the assumed dust absorbance. All
   the data are publicly available from the Leiden VUV cross section
   database.
   Results. The Leiden VUV cross section database has been updated with 14
   new astrophysically relevant molecular species and 16 updates to
   previous entries. The database update is accompanied by a brief review
   of the basic physical processes, particularly photoionization processes
   which have not been reviewed in the context of previous database
   updates.},
