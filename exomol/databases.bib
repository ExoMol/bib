Abstract = {Context. Detailed astrochemical models are a key component to interpret
   the observations of interstellar and circumstellar molecules since they
   allow important physical properties of the gas and its evolutionary
   history to be deduced.
   Aims. We update one of the most widely used astrochemical databases to
   reflect advances in experimental and theoretical estimates of rate
   coefficients and to respond to the large increase in the number of
   molecules detected in space since our last release in 2013.
   Methods. We present the sixth release of the UMIST Database for
   Astrochemistry (UDfA), a major expansion of the gas-phase chemistry that
   describes the synthesis of interstellar and circumstellar molecules.
   Since our last release, we have undertaken a major review of the
   literature which has increased the number of reactions by over 40\% to a
   total of 8767 and increased the number of species by over 55\% to 737.
   We have made a particular attempt to include many of the new species
   detected in space over the past decade, including those from the QUIJOTE
   and GOTHAM surveys, as well as providing references to the original data
   sources.
   Results. We use the database to investigate the gas-phase chemistries
   appropriate to both O-rich and C-rich conditions in TMC-1 and to the
   circumstellar envelope of the C-rich AGB star IRC+10216 and identify
   successes and failures of gas-phase only models.
   Conclusions. This update is a significant improvement to the UDfA
   database. For both the dark cloud and C-rich circumstellar envelope
   models, calculations match around 60\% of the abundances of observed
   species to within an order of magnitude. There are a number of detected
   species, however, that are not included in the model either because
   their gas-phase chemistry is unknown or because they are likely formed
   via surface reactions on icy grains. Future laboratory and theoretical
   work is needed to include such species in reaction networks.},

Title = {Photodissociation and photoionization of molecules of astronomical
   interest Updates to the Leiden photodissociation and photoionization
   cross section database},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {675},
Abstract = {Context. Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photons are important drivers of
   chemical processes in space. Thus, it is important to accurately
   characterize and constrain photorates in different radiation fields, via
   the photodissociation and photoionization cross sections of individual
   atoms and molecules. These have been available in the Leiden VUV
   photodissocation and photoionization cross section database.
   Aims. Experimental and theoretical advances in the past decade or so
   have allowed multiple new cross sections to be obtained, particularly
   photoionization cross sections of radicals. The database is hereby
   updated by including these more recent cross sections and is also
   expanded with several astronomically relevant species.
   Methods. The cross sections have been used to calculate
   photodissociation and photoionization rates in several different
   radiation fields as well as from cosmic-ray-induced VUV fluxes. The
   reduction of rates in shielded regions was calculated as a function of
   dust, molecular and atomic hydrogen, atomic carbon, and self-shielding
   column densities. The relative importance of these shielding types is
   molecule and atom dependent, as well as the assumed dust absorbance. All
   the data are publicly available from the Leiden VUV cross section
   database.
   Results. The Leiden VUV cross section database has been updated with 14
   new astrophysically relevant molecular species and 16 updates to
   previous entries. The database update is accompanied by a brief review
   of the basic physical processes, particularly photoionization processes
   which have not been reviewed in the context of previous database
   updates.},
