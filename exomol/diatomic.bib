PAGES = {1--15},
ABSTRACT = {This work communicates line-strength data and associated scripts for the computation and spectroscopic fitting of selected transitions of diatomic molecules. The scripts for data analysis are designed for inclusion in various software packages or program languages. Selected results demonstrate the applicability of the program for data analysis in laser-induced optical breakdown spectroscopy primarily at the University of Tennessee Space Institute, Center for Laser Applications. Representative spectra are calculated and referenced to measured data records. Comparisons of experiment data with predictions from other tabulated diatomic molecular databases confirm the accuracy of the communicated line-strength data.},

The IHH analytical potential function that involves a variable parameter, four empirically determined low-order molecular vibrational and rotational spectral constants and the dissociation energy was applied to the ground electronic states of HF and HCl, yielding a good agreement between the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential energy points and the calculations. Correspondingly, with the determined IHH PECs, the partition functions at temperatures 300–6000 Kelvin (K) and rovibrational line intensities are evaluated, and coincide well with those quoted in the HITRAN2020 database compilation. The methodology could be valuable for the detection of molecules in interstellar clouds using infrared spectroscopy, as well as thermochemical reactions.},

   performance of diatomic vibrational energies},
Journal = IJQC,
Abstract = {Through the comprehensive analysis of ab initio and experimental results
   of a large number of diatomic systems, the systematic deviation of ab
   initio method in vibrational energies prediction caused by
   physical/mathematical simplification is located. A joint ab initio and
   machine learning method based on information across molecules is
   proposed to deal with the problem. Starting from an ab initio model, and
   then systematically modifying it through machine learning, the
   vibrational energies prediction of many diatomic systems (SiC, HBr, NO,
   PC, N-2, SiO, O-2, ClF, etc.) have been improved, and significantly
   surpassed the more complex ab initio model. In addition to the
   improvement of accuracy, the new method also greatly reduces the
   computational expense, and is applicable for the systems without

Title = {VIBFREQ1295: A New Database for Vibrational Frequency Calculations},
Journal = JPCA,
Abstract = {High-throughput approaches for producing approximate vibrational
   spectral data for molecules of astrochemistry interest rely on harmonic
   frequency calculations using computational quantum chemistry. However,
   model chemistry recommendations (i.e., a level of theory and basis set
   pair) for these calculations are not yet available and, thus, thorough
   benchmarking against comprehensive benchmark databases is needed. Here,
   we present a new database for vibrational frequency calculations
   (VIBFREQ1295) storing 1295 experimental fundamental frequencies and
   CCSD(T)(F12{*})/cc-pVDZ-F12 ab initio harmonic frequencies from 141
   molecules. VIBFREQ1295-s experimental data was complied through a
   comprehensive review of contemporary experimental data, while the ab
   initio data was computed here. The chemical space spanned by the
   molecules chosen is considered in-depth and is shown to have good
   representation of common organic functional groups and vibrational
   modes. Scaling factors are routinely used to approximate the effect of
   anharmonicity and convert computed harmonic frequencies to predicted
   fundamental frequencies. With our experimental and high-level ab initio
   data, we find that a single global uniform scaling factor of 0.9617(3)
   results in median differences of 15.9(5) cm(-1). A far superior
   performance with a median difference of 7.5(5) cm(-1) can be obtained,
   however, by using separate scaling factors (SFs) for three regions:
   frequencies less than 1000 cm(-1) (SF = 0.987(1)), between 1000 and 2000
   cm(-1) (SF = 0.9727(6)), and above 2000 cm(-1) (SF = 0.9564(4)). This
   sets a lower bound for the performance that could be reliably obtained
   using scaling of harmonic frequency calculations to predict experimental
   fundamental frequencies. VIBFREQ1295-s most important purpose is to
   provide a robust database for benchmarking the performance of any
   vibrational frequency calculations. VIBFREQ1295 data could also be used
   to train machine-learning models for the prediction of vibrational
   spectra and as a reference and data starting point for more detailed
   spectroscopic modeling of particular molecules. The database can be
   found as part of the Supporting Information for this paper or in the
   Harvard DataVerse at https://doi.org/10.7910/ DVN/VLVNU7.},

abstract = {Abstract Accurate and comprehensive diatomic molecular spectroscopic data have long been vital in a wide variety of applications for measuring and monitoring astrophysical, industrial, and other gaseous environments. These data are also used extensively for benchmarking quantum chemistry and applications from quantum computers, ultracold chemistry and the search for physics beyond the standard model. Useful data can be highly detailed like line lists or summative like molecular constants, and obtained from theory, experiment, or a combination. There are plentiful (though not yet sufficient) data available, but these data are often scattered. For example, molecular constants have not been compiled since 1979 despite the existing compilation still being cited more than 200 times annually. Furthermore, the data are interconnected but updates in one type of data are not yet routinely applied to update interconnected data: in particular, new experimental and ab initio data are not routinely unified with other data on the molecule. This paper provides information and strategies to strengthen the connection between data producers (e.g., ab initio electronic structure theorists and experimental spectroscopists), data modelers (e.g., line list creators and others who connect data on one aspect of the molecule to the full energetic and spectroscopic description) and data users (astronomers, chemical physicists, etc.). All major data types are described including their source, use, compilation, and interconnectivity. Explicit advice is provided for theoretical and experimental data producers, data modelers, and data users to facilitate optimal use of new data with appropriate attribution.

Abstract={{Interatomic potentials laid at the heart of molecular physics. They are a bridge between the spectroscopic and structural properties of molecular systems. In this paper, a century-old review from 1920 to 2020, of functional forms used to analytically represent potential energy as a function of interatomic distance for diatomic systems is presented. With such a purpose fifty functions were selected. For all of them, motivation and the main mathematical features are discussed. Our goal is to provide a chronological pathway to the reader, even with little knowledge on the subject, to understand how to calculate each parameter that composes the interatomic potentials, as well as obtain spectroscopic constants from them. Comparative evaluation for the N2, CO, and HeH+ systems in their ground electronic states are also presented.}},

Title = {{Molecules as magnetic probes of starspots}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{576}},
Abstract = {{Context. Stellar dynamo processes can be explored by measuring the
   magnetic field. This is usually obtained using the atomic and molecular
   Zeeman effect in spectral lines. While the atomic Zeeman effect can only
   access warmer regions, the use of molecular lines is of advantage for
   studying cool objects. The molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH are suited
   to probe stellar magnetic fields, each one for a different range of
   spectral types, by considering the signal that is obtained from modeling
   various spectral types.
   Aims. We have analyzed the usefulness of different molecules (MgH, TiO,
   CaH, and FeH) as diagnostic tools for studying stellar magnetism on
   active G-K-M dwarfs. We investigate the temperature range in which the
   selected molecules can serve as indicators for magnetic fields on highly
   active cool stars and present synthetic Stokes profiles for the modeled
   spectral type.
   Methods. We modeled a star with a spot size of 10\% of the stellar disk
   and a spot comprising either only longitudinal or only transverse
   magnetic fields and estimated the strengths of the polarization Stokes V
   and Q signals for the molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH. We combined
   various photosphere and spot models according to realistic scenarios.
   Results. In G dwarfs, the molecules MgH and FeH show overall the
   strongest Stokes V and Q signals from the starspot, whereas FeH has a
   stronger Stokes V signal in all G dwarfs with a spot temperature of 3800
   K. In K dwarfs, CaH signals are generally stronger, and the TiO
   signature is most prominent in M dwarfs.
   Conclusions. Modeling synthetic polarization signals from starspots for
   a range of G-K-M dwarfs leads to differences in the prominence of
   various molecular signatures in different wavelength regions, which
   helps to efficiently select targets and exposure times for observations.}},

Abstract = {A new formalism for the accurate treatment of adiabatic effects in the

Title = {Magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {512},
Pages = {286+},
Abstract = {Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. The
   most used technique in cold-atomphysics is the magneto-optical trap
   (MOT), which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from
   radiation pressure. For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture
   and cool large numbers of particles to ultracold temperatures (less than
   similar to 1 millikelvin); this has enabled advances in areas that range
   fromoptical clocks to the study of ultracold collisions, while also
   serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the
   regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules
   could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and
   manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. The additional degrees of
   freedom associated with the vibration and rotation of molecules,
   particularly their permanent electric dipole moments, allow a broad
   array of applications not possible with ultracold atoms(1). Spurred by
   these ideas, a variety of methods has been developed to create ultracold
   molecules. Temperatures below 1 microkelvin have been demonstrated for
   diatomic molecules assembled from pre-cooled alkali atoms(2,3), but for
   the wider range of species amenable to direct cooling and trapping, only
   recently have temperatures below 100 millikelvin been achieved(4,5). The
   complex internal structure of molecules complicates magneto-optical
   trapping. However, ideas and methods necessary for creating a molecular
   MOT have been developed(6-11) recently. Here we demonstrate three
   dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium
   monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 millikelvin,
   the lowest yet achieved by direct cooling of a molecule. This method is
   a straightforward extension of atomic techniques and is expected to be
   viable for a significant number of diatomic species(6,7). With further
   development, we anticipate that this techniquemay be employed in any
   number of existing and proposed molecular experiments, in applications
   ranging from precision measurement(12) to quantum simulation(13) and
   quantum information(14) to ultracold chemistry(15).},

Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {We present quantum-chemical calculations for the ground and some
   low-lying excited states of isolated LiCa and LiSr molecules using
   multi-state complete active space second-order perturbation theory
   (MS-CASPT2). The potential energy curves (PECs) and their corresponding
   spectroscopic constants, obtained at the spin-free (SF) and spin-orbit
   (SO) levels, agree well with available experimental values. Our
   SO-MS-CASPT2 calculation at the atomic limit (R = 100 a.u.) with the
   largest basis set reproduces experimental atomic excitation energies
   within 3\% for both LiCa and LiSr. In addition, permanent dipole moments
   and transition dipole moments at the SF level are also obtained.
   Rovibrational calculations of the ground and selected excited states,
   together with the spontaneous emission rates, demonstrate that the
   formation of ultracold LiCa and LiSr molecules in low-lying vibrational
   levels of the electronic ground state may be possible.},

Journal = JPCA,
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{A new spectrum of the autoionizing triplet states of gerade symmetry of
   H-2 has been recorded from the upsilon `' = 1-4, N `' = 1-3
   rovibrational levels of the metastable c 3 Pi(-)(u) state in a
   supersonic beam. The spectrum consists of overlapping ns and nd Rydberg
   series with n in the range between 4 and 45 converging to the upsilon(+)
   = 1-4, N+ = 0-5 levels of the X+ 2 Sigma(+)(g) ground state of H-2(+).
   Numerous perturbations caused by s-d and rovibrational channel
   interactions are revealed in the spectrum and were fully assigned by
   combining double-resonance experiments and ab initio multichannel
   quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The energy- and
   internuclear-distance-dependent eigenquantum-defect parameters of MQDT
   were derived from available,ab initio calculations of the low-lying
   electronic states of H-2 and the ground state of H-2(+) and were
   subsequently refined in a global fit to experimental data. The positions
   of 552 triplet ns and nd Rydberg levels of H-2 (361 of which were
   measured in the present study) could be reproduced with a
   root-mean-square deviation of 0.2 cm(-1).}},

Abstract = {We present high-level four-component coupled cluster and multireference

   dipole moment, Franck-Condon factors and spectroscopic constants of the
   newly formed RbYb molecule From finite-field calculations we obtain an

   magnetic dipole moment this makes RbYb an excellent candidate for
   trapping and for studying dipolar interaction in the ultracold regime.
   Significant Franck-Condon factors are found between the rovibronic
   ground state mid the lowest rovibrational levels of the first excited
   (2)Sigma(+)(1/2) state but also between a broad range of rovibrational
   levels of the (2)Pi(1/2) and (2)Pi(3/2) states This allows for several
   two-step approaches to reach the rovibronic ground state after initial

Title = {Avoided crossings between bound states of ultracold cesium dimers},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {78},
Abstract = {We present an efficient computational method for calculating the binding
   energies of the bound states of ultracold alkali-metal dimers in the
   presence of magnetic fields. The method is based on propagation of
   coupled differential equations and does not use a basis set for the
   interatomic distance coordinate. It is much more efficient than the
   previous method based on a radial basis set and allows many more spin
   channels to be included. This is particularly important in the vicinity
   of avoided crossings between bound states. We characterize a number of
   different avoided crossings in Cs-2 and compare our converged
   calculations with experimental results. Small but significant
   discrepancies are observed in both crossing strengths and level
   positions, especially for levels with l symmetry (rotational angular
   momentum L=8). The discrepancies should allow the development of
   improved potential models in the future.},

DOI = {10.1086/497892},
  abstract={This paper describes a very general approach to the calculation of the Zeeman splitting effect produced by an external magnetic field on the rotational levels of diatomic molecules. The method is valid for arbitrary values of the total electronic spin and of the magnetic field strength—that is, it holds for molecular electronic states of any multiplicity and for both the Zeeman and incomplete Paschen-Back regimes. It is based on an efficient numerical diagonalization of the effective Zeeman Hamiltonian, which can incorporate easily all the contributions one may eventually be interested in, such as the hyperfine interaction of the external magnetic field with the spin motions of the nuclei. The reliability of the method is demonstrated by comparing our results with previous ones obtained via formulae valid only for doublet states. We also present results for molecular transitions arising between nondoublet electronic states, illustrating that their Zeeman patterns show signatures produced by the Paschen-Back effect.}
