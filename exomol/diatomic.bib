Abstract = {{The coupled channel method for solving the bound-state Schrodinger equation is described. The method has been widely applied to the vibrational-rotational levels of floppy molecules such as Van der Waals complexes, but is also applicable in other areas of physics. It uses a basis set expansion for all degrees of freedom except a radial coordinate, and produces a set of coupled differential equations in the radial coordinate. In modern methods of solution, the coupled equations are solved by propagating the log-derivative of the wavefunction. Eigenvalues are located by searching for zeroes of: the determinant of the ''log-derivative matching matrix'' The resulting methods are very stable, and are the method of choice for providing eigenvalues to very high precision. Some recent advances in the methods, which provide improved convergence on eigenvalues and allow the calculation of wavefunctions, are described.}},

   compute the splitting of levels of any multiplicity and the transitions
   between them. We also introduce a generalized description of the
   effective magnetic Lande factor applicable not just in the Zeeman

   of the partial Paschen-Back effect strongly asymmetric Stokes profiles
   are produced, whose strengths and asymmetries depend sensitively on the
   magnetic field. In the regime of the complete Paschen-Back e.ect the
   profiles become symmetric again (although they may be strongly shifted).
   The strength of the forbidden and satellite transitions increases
   rapidly with field strength in the partial Paschen-Back regime, while
   the strength of the main branch transitions decreases. These signatures
   hold promise to form the basis of new diagnostics of solar and stellar

Title = {Magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {512},
Pages = {286+},
Abstract = {Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. The
   most used technique in cold-atomphysics is the magneto-optical trap
   (MOT), which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from
   radiation pressure. For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture
   and cool large numbers of particles to ultracold temperatures (less than
   similar to 1 millikelvin); this has enabled advances in areas that range
   fromoptical clocks to the study of ultracold collisions, while also
   serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the
   regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules
   could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and
   manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. The additional degrees of
   freedom associated with the vibration and rotation of molecules,
   particularly their permanent electric dipole moments, allow a broad
   array of applications not possible with ultracold atoms(1). Spurred by
   these ideas, a variety of methods has been developed to create ultracold
   molecules. Temperatures below 1 microkelvin have been demonstrated for
   diatomic molecules assembled from pre-cooled alkali atoms(2,3), but for
   the wider range of species amenable to direct cooling and trapping, only
   recently have temperatures below 100 millikelvin been achieved(4,5). The
   complex internal structure of molecules complicates magneto-optical
   trapping. However, ideas and methods necessary for creating a molecular
   MOT have been developed(6-11) recently. Here we demonstrate three
   dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium
   monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 millikelvin,
   the lowest yet achieved by direct cooling of a molecule. This method is
   a straightforward extension of atomic techniques and is expected to be
   viable for a significant number of diatomic species(6,7). With further
   development, we anticipate that this techniquemay be employed in any
   number of existing and proposed molecular experiments, in applications
   ranging from precision measurement(12) to quantum simulation(13) and
   quantum information(14) to ultracold chemistry(15).},

Abstract = {The inversion of diatomic vibration-rotation data to give the r

   <vJ\textbackslash{}X(r)\textbackslash{}vJ> of an operator X(r), the
   inversion is unambiguous if the reduced mass is known, leading to the
   potential energy function V(r) and to X(r). The breakdown of the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation is represented in terms of three
   functions Q(i)(r), R-i(r), and S-i(r) for each atom i. The function
   Q(i)(r) can be removed by a transformation that changes the other
   functions to (R) over tilde (i)(r) and (S) over tilde (i)(r), which
   still have one degree of indeterminacy. The effects of this
   indeterminacy in fits to truncated Hamiltonians is considered for the

   relevant to a recent claim that the dipole moment and rotational g(J)
   factor of LiH can be determined from a fit to field-free
   vibration-rotation spectra. The values obtained for these quantities are
   unreliable because they are strongly dependent on the constraints used

   frequencies (with uncertainties +/- 0.001 cm(-1)) is obtained from an
   unconstrained combined-isotopomer Dunham-type analysis, it requires a
   large number (62) of expansion parameters, and the resulting empirical
   centrifugal distortion constants (CDCs) are unreliable for extrapolation
   to higher-J. Moreover, Dunham expansion fits using constrained
   theoretical values of the first six CDCs (up to O-v) fail to properly
   represent the data, as even higher-order CDCs are required. However, a
   direct fit of these data to an analytical ``modified Lennard-Jones{''}
   potential energy function involving only 16 fitted parameters yields
   essentially the same quality of fit as did the unconstrained Dunham fit,
   and should be reliable for extrapolation to arbitrarily high J. This

   spectroscopic constants, obtained at the spin-free (SF) and spin-orbit
   (SO) levels, agree well with available experimental values. Our
   SO-MS-CASPT2 calculation at the atomic limit (R = 100 a.u.) with the
   largest basis set reproduces experimental atomic excitation energies
   within 3\% for both LiCa and LiSr. In addition, permanent dipole moments

   Rovibrational calculations of the ground and selected excited states,
   together with the spontaneous emission rates, demonstrate that the
   formation of ultracold LiCa and LiSr molecules in low-lying vibrational
   levels of the electronic ground state may be possible.},

Title = {Avoided crossings between bound states of ultracold cesium dimers},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {78},
Abstract = {We present an efficient computational method for calculating the binding
   energies of the bound states of ultracold alkali-metal dimers in the
   presence of magnetic fields. The method is based on propagation of
   coupled differential equations and does not use a basis set for the
   interatomic distance coordinate. It is much more efficient than the
   previous method based on a radial basis set and allows many more spin
   channels to be included. This is particularly important in the vicinity
   of avoided crossings between bound states. We characterize a number of
   different avoided crossings in Cs-2 and compare our converged
   calculations with experimental results. Small but significant
   discrepancies are observed in both crossing strengths and level
   positions, especially for levels with l symmetry (rotational angular
   momentum L=8). The discrepancies should allow the development of
   improved potential models in the future.},

Journal = THEOCHEM,

Volume = {591},
Pages = {175-187},
Abstract = {The empirical determination of Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB)
   correction functions from the analysis of high resolution diatomic
   molecule spectra is becoming increasingly common. However, in virtually
   all applications to date, the analytic expressions used to represent
   those functions have unphysical limiting behaviour which makes the
   resulting overall potential energy functions unusable at long-range.
   This paper delineates the limiting physical constraints, which should be
   imposed on the form of such BOB correction functions, and presents
   flexible new expressions incorporating those constraints. The utility of
   these new forms is illustrated by a re-analysis of recent high
   resolution IR data for the ground electronic state of AgH, which yields
   an updated potential energy function and more meaningful adiabatic
   (potential) and non-adiabatic (centrifugal) BOB correction functions for
   this system. Further examination of this AgH system also illustrates the
   problem of model dependence associated with efforts to determine
   physically unique potential energy and centrifugal BOB correction

Abstract = {A new formalism for the accurate treatment of adiabatic effects in the
   hydrogen molecule is presented, in which the electronic wave function is

   results for the adiabatic correction to the Born-Oppenheimer interaction
   energy reveal a relative precision of 10(-12) at an arbitrary
   internuclear distance. Such calculations have been performed for 88
   internuclear distances in the range of 0 < R <= 12 bohrs to construct
   the adiabatic correction potential and to solve the nuclear Schrodinger
   equation. Finally, the adiabatic correction to the dissociation energies
   of all rovibrational levels in H-2, HD, HT, D-2, DT, and T-2 has been
   determined. For the ground state of H-2 the estimated precision is 3 x
   10(-7) cm(-1), which is almost three orders of magnitude higher than
   that of the best previous result. The achieved accuracy removes the

Rovibronic interactions between different electronic states are taken into account by transformation to an effective vibration-rotation Hamiltonian for each electronic state.

The effects of these contributions on the vibration-rotation energies are expressed in terms of two functions R̃i(r) and S̃i(r) for each atom i. The resultant formula for Ykl is Ykl=μc−(k+2l)2Ukl{1+meΔklaMa+meΔklbMb+O(me2Mi2)}, where Ukl, Δkla, and Δklb are isotopically invariant, Ma and Mb are the atomic masses, and μc = MaMb(Ma + Mb − Cme) is the atomic reduced mass, modified by the molecular charge number C for charged species. The Ukl with l ≥ 2 can be calculated from those with l = 0 and 1. The corrections UklΔkli are related to the functions R̃i(r) and S̃i(r) and to the Dunham corrections. Recent data for the \{CO\} molecule are discussed, and it is suggested that some large Δkli values are associated with accidentally small Ukl values, since the size of UklΔkli is not directly related to that of Ukl.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{576}},
Abstract = {{Context. Stellar dynamo processes can be explored by measuring the
   magnetic field. This is usually obtained using the atomic and molecular
   Zeeman effect in spectral lines. While the atomic Zeeman effect can only
   access warmer regions, the use of molecular lines is of advantage for
   studying cool objects. The molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH are suited
   to probe stellar magnetic fields, each one for a different range of
   spectral types, by considering the signal that is obtained from modeling
   various spectral types.
   Aims. We have analyzed the usefulness of different molecules (MgH, TiO,
   CaH, and FeH) as diagnostic tools for studying stellar magnetism on
   active G-K-M dwarfs. We investigate the temperature range in which the
   selected molecules can serve as indicators for magnetic fields on highly
   active cool stars and present synthetic Stokes profiles for the modeled
   spectral type.
   Methods. We modeled a star with a spot size of 10\% of the stellar disk
   and a spot comprising either only longitudinal or only transverse
   magnetic fields and estimated the strengths of the polarization Stokes V
   and Q signals for the molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH. We combined
   various photosphere and spot models according to realistic scenarios.
   Results. In G dwarfs, the molecules MgH and FeH show overall the
   strongest Stokes V and Q signals from the starspot, whereas FeH has a
   stronger Stokes V signal in all G dwarfs with a spot temperature of 3800
   K. In K dwarfs, CaH signals are generally stronger, and the TiO
   signature is most prominent in M dwarfs.
   Conclusions. Modeling synthetic polarization signals from starspots for
   a range of G-K-M dwarfs leads to differences in the prominence of
   various molecular signatures in different wavelength regions, which
   helps to efficiently select targets and exposure times for observations.}},

The method is valid for arbitrary values of the total electronic spin and of the magnetic field strength—that is, it holds for molecular electronic states of any multiplicity and for both the Zeeman and incomplete Paschen-Back regimes. It is based on an efficient numerical diagonalization of the effective Zeeman Hamiltonian, which can incorporate easily all the contributions one may eventually be interested in, such as the hyperfine interaction of the external magnetic field with the spin motions of the nuclei. The reliability of the method is demonstrated by comparing our results with previous ones obtained via formulae valid only for doublet states. We also present results for molecular transitions arising between nondoublet electronic states, illustrating that their Zeeman patterns show signatures produced by the Paschen-Back effect.}

Abstract = {{Very accurate variational calculations of the fundamental pure
   vibrational transitions of the He-3 He-4(+) and (LiH+)-Li-7 ions are
   performed within the framework that does not assume the Born-Oppenheimer
   (BO) approximation. The non-BO wave functions expanded in terms of
   one-center explicitly correlated Gaussian functions multiplied by even
   powers of the internuclear distance are used to calculate the leading
   relativistic corrections. Up to 10 000 Gaussian functions are used for
   each state. It is shown that the experimental He-3 He-4(+) fundamental
   transitions is reproduced within 0.06 cm(-1) by the calculations. A
   similar precision is expected for the calculated, but still unmeasured,
   fundamental transition of (LiH+)-Li-7. Thus, three-electron diatomic
   systems are calculated with a similar accuracy as two-electron systems.}},
