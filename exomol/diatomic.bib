The IHH analytical potential function that involves a variable parameter, four empirically determined low-order molecular vibrational and rotational spectral constants and the dissociation energy was applied to the ground electronic states of HF and HCl, yielding a good agreement between the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential energy points and the calculations. Correspondingly, with the determined IHH PECs, the partition functions at temperatures 300–6000 Kelvin (K) and rovibrational line intensities are evaluated, and coincide well with those quoted in the HITRAN2020 database compilation. The methodology could be valuable for the detection of molecules in interstellar clouds using infrared spectroscopy, as well as thermochemical reactions.},

Journal = IJQC,
Abstract = {Through the comprehensive analysis of ab initio and experimental results

   proposed to deal with the problem. Starting from an ab initio model, and

   vibrational energies prediction of many diatomic systems (SiC, HBr, NO,
   PC, N-2, SiO, O-2, ClF, etc.) have been improved, and significantly
   surpassed the more complex ab initio model. In addition to the
   improvement of accuracy, the new method also greatly reduces the
   computational expense, and is applicable for the systems without

Title = {VIBFREQ1295: A New Database for Vibrational Frequency Calculations},
Journal = JPCA,
Abstract = {High-throughput approaches for producing approximate vibrational
   spectral data for molecules of astrochemistry interest rely on harmonic
   frequency calculations using computational quantum chemistry. However,
   model chemistry recommendations (i.e., a level of theory and basis set
   pair) for these calculations are not yet available and, thus, thorough
   benchmarking against comprehensive benchmark databases is needed. Here,
   we present a new database for vibrational frequency calculations
   (VIBFREQ1295) storing 1295 experimental fundamental frequencies and
   CCSD(T)(F12{*})/cc-pVDZ-F12 ab initio harmonic frequencies from 141
   molecules. VIBFREQ1295-s experimental data was complied through a
   comprehensive review of contemporary experimental data, while the ab
   initio data was computed here. The chemical space spanned by the
   molecules chosen is considered in-depth and is shown to have good
   representation of common organic functional groups and vibrational
   modes. Scaling factors are routinely used to approximate the effect of
   anharmonicity and convert computed harmonic frequencies to predicted
   fundamental frequencies. With our experimental and high-level ab initio
   data, we find that a single global uniform scaling factor of 0.9617(3)
   results in median differences of 15.9(5) cm(-1). A far superior
   performance with a median difference of 7.5(5) cm(-1) can be obtained,
   however, by using separate scaling factors (SFs) for three regions:
   frequencies less than 1000 cm(-1) (SF = 0.987(1)), between 1000 and 2000
   cm(-1) (SF = 0.9727(6)), and above 2000 cm(-1) (SF = 0.9564(4)). This
   sets a lower bound for the performance that could be reliably obtained
   using scaling of harmonic frequency calculations to predict experimental
   fundamental frequencies. VIBFREQ1295-s most important purpose is to
   provide a robust database for benchmarking the performance of any
   vibrational frequency calculations. VIBFREQ1295 data could also be used
   to train machine-learning models for the prediction of vibrational
   spectra and as a reference and data starting point for more detailed
   spectroscopic modeling of particular molecules. The database can be
   found as part of the Supporting Information for this paper or in the
   Harvard DataVerse at https://doi.org/10.7910/ DVN/VLVNU7.},

abstract = {Abstract Accurate and comprehensive diatomic molecular spectroscopic data have long been vital in a wide variety of applications for measuring and monitoring astrophysical, industrial, and other gaseous environments. These data are also used extensively for benchmarking quantum chemistry and applications from quantum computers, ultracold chemistry and the search for physics beyond the standard model. Useful data can be highly detailed like line lists or summative like molecular constants, and obtained from theory, experiment, or a combination. There are plentiful (though not yet sufficient) data available, but these data are often scattered. For example, molecular constants have not been compiled since 1979 despite the existing compilation still being cited more than 200 times annually. Furthermore, the data are interconnected but updates in one type of data are not yet routinely applied to update interconnected data: in particular, new experimental and ab initio data are not routinely unified with other data on the molecule. This paper provides information and strategies to strengthen the connection between data producers (e.g., ab initio electronic structure theorists and experimental spectroscopists), data modelers (e.g., line list creators and others who connect data on one aspect of the molecule to the full energetic and spectroscopic description) and data users (astronomers, chemical physicists, etc.). All major data types are described including their source, use, compilation, and interconnectivity. Explicit advice is provided for theoretical and experimental data producers, data modelers, and data users to facilitate optimal use of new data with appropriate attribution.

In this paper, a century-old review from 1920 to 2020, of functional forms used to analytically represent potential energy as a function of interatomic distance for diatomic systems is presented. With such a purpose fifty functions were selected. For all of them, motivation and the main mathematical features are discussed. Our goal is to provide a chronological pathway to the reader, even with little knowledge on the subject, to understand how to calculate each parameter that composes the interatomic potentials, as well as obtain spectroscopic constants from them. Comparative evaluation for the N2, CO, and HeH+ systems in their ground electronic states are also presented.}},

Title = {{Molecules as magnetic probes of starspots}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{576}},
Abstract = {{Context. Stellar dynamo processes can be explored by measuring the
   magnetic field. This is usually obtained using the atomic and molecular
   Zeeman effect in spectral lines. While the atomic Zeeman effect can only
   access warmer regions, the use of molecular lines is of advantage for
   studying cool objects. The molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH are suited
   to probe stellar magnetic fields, each one for a different range of
   spectral types, by considering the signal that is obtained from modeling
   various spectral types.
   Aims. We have analyzed the usefulness of different molecules (MgH, TiO,
   CaH, and FeH) as diagnostic tools for studying stellar magnetism on
   active G-K-M dwarfs. We investigate the temperature range in which the
   selected molecules can serve as indicators for magnetic fields on highly
   active cool stars and present synthetic Stokes profiles for the modeled
   spectral type.
   Methods. We modeled a star with a spot size of 10\% of the stellar disk
   and a spot comprising either only longitudinal or only transverse
   magnetic fields and estimated the strengths of the polarization Stokes V
   and Q signals for the molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH. We combined
   various photosphere and spot models according to realistic scenarios.
   Results. In G dwarfs, the molecules MgH and FeH show overall the
   strongest Stokes V and Q signals from the starspot, whereas FeH has a
   stronger Stokes V signal in all G dwarfs with a spot temperature of 3800
   K. In K dwarfs, CaH signals are generally stronger, and the TiO
   signature is most prominent in M dwarfs.
   Conclusions. Modeling synthetic polarization signals from starspots for
   a range of G-K-M dwarfs leads to differences in the prominence of
   various molecular signatures in different wavelength regions, which
   helps to efficiently select targets and exposure times for observations.}},

Abstract = {A new formalism for the accurate treatment of adiabatic effects in the

   energy reveal a relative precision of 10(-12) at an arbitrary
   internuclear distance. Such calculations have been performed for 88
   internuclear distances in the range of 0 < R <= 12 bohrs to construct
   the adiabatic correction potential and to solve the nuclear Schrodinger
   equation. Finally, the adiabatic correction to the dissociation energies
   of all rovibrational levels in H-2, HD, HT, D-2, DT, and T-2 has been
   determined. For the ground state of H-2 the estimated precision is 3 x

Title = {Magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {512},
Pages = {286+},
Abstract = {Laser cooling and trapping are central to modern atomic physics. The
   most used technique in cold-atomphysics is the magneto-optical trap
   (MOT), which combines laser cooling with a restoring force from
   radiation pressure. For a variety of atomic species, MOTs can capture
   and cool large numbers of particles to ultracold temperatures (less than
   similar to 1 millikelvin); this has enabled advances in areas that range
   fromoptical clocks to the study of ultracold collisions, while also
   serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the
   regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules
   could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and
   manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. The additional degrees of
   freedom associated with the vibration and rotation of molecules,
   particularly their permanent electric dipole moments, allow a broad
   array of applications not possible with ultracold atoms(1). Spurred by
   these ideas, a variety of methods has been developed to create ultracold
   molecules. Temperatures below 1 microkelvin have been demonstrated for
   diatomic molecules assembled from pre-cooled alkali atoms(2,3), but for
   the wider range of species amenable to direct cooling and trapping, only
   recently have temperatures below 100 millikelvin been achieved(4,5). The
   complex internal structure of molecules complicates magneto-optical
   trapping. However, ideas and methods necessary for creating a molecular
   MOT have been developed(6-11) recently. Here we demonstrate three
   dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium
   monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 millikelvin,
   the lowest yet achieved by direct cooling of a molecule. This method is
   a straightforward extension of atomic techniques and is expected to be
   viable for a significant number of diatomic species(6,7). With further
   development, we anticipate that this techniquemay be employed in any
   number of existing and proposed molecular experiments, in applications
   ranging from precision measurement(12) to quantum simulation(13) and
   quantum information(14) to ultracold chemistry(15).},

Abstract = {{A new spectrum of the autoionizing triplet states of gerade symmetry of
   H-2 has been recorded from the upsilon `' = 1-4, N `' = 1-3
   rovibrational levels of the metastable c 3 Pi(-)(u) state in a
   supersonic beam. The spectrum consists of overlapping ns and nd Rydberg
   series with n in the range between 4 and 45 converging to the upsilon(+)
   = 1-4, N+ = 0-5 levels of the X+ 2 Sigma(+)(g) ground state of H-2(+).
   Numerous perturbations caused by s-d and rovibrational channel
   interactions are revealed in the spectrum and were fully assigned by
   combining double-resonance experiments and ab initio multichannel
   quantum-defect theory (MQDT). The energy- and
   internuclear-distance-dependent eigenquantum-defect parameters of MQDT
   were derived from available,ab initio calculations of the low-lying
   electronic states of H-2 and the ground state of H-2(+) and were
   subsequently refined in a global fit to experimental data. The positions
   of 552 triplet ns and nd Rydberg levels of H-2 (361 of which were
   measured in the present study) could be reproduced with a
   root-mean-square deviation of 0.2 cm(-1).}},

Abstract = {We present an efficient computational method for calculating the binding

   channels to be included. This is particularly important in the vicinity
   of avoided crossings between bound states. We characterize a number of
   different avoided crossings in Cs-2 and compare our converged
   calculations with experimental results. Small but significant
   discrepancies are observed in both crossing strengths and level
   positions, especially for levels with l symmetry (rotational angular

  abstract={This paper describes a very general approach to the calculation of the Zeeman splitting effect produced by an external magnetic field on the rotational levels of diatomic molecules. The method is valid for arbitrary values of the total electronic spin and of the magnetic field strength—that is, it holds for molecular electronic states of any multiplicity and for both the Zeeman and incomplete Paschen-Back regimes. It is based on an efficient numerical diagonalization of the effective Zeeman Hamiltonian, which can incorporate easily all the contributions one may eventually be interested in, such as the hyperfine interaction of the external magnetic field with the spin motions of the nuclei. The reliability of the method is demonstrated by comparing our results with previous ones obtained via formulae valid only for doublet states. We also present results for molecular transitions arising between nondoublet electronic states, illustrating that their Zeeman patterns show signatures produced by the Paschen-Back effect.}

Abstract = {The inversion of diatomic vibration-rotation data to give the r
   dependence of operators is considered. For the Born-Oppenheimer energy
   levels E-vJ and for the expectation values
   <vJ\textbackslash{}X(r)\textbackslash{}vJ> of an operator X(r), the
   inversion is unambiguous if the reduced mass is known, leading to the
   potential energy function V(r) and to X(r). The breakdown of the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation is represented in terms of three
   functions Q(i)(r), R-i(r), and S-i(r) for each atom i. The function
   Q(i)(r) can be removed by a transformation that changes the other
   functions to (R) over tilde (i)(r) and (S) over tilde (i)(r), which
   still have one degree of indeterminacy. The effects of this
   indeterminacy in fits to truncated Hamiltonians is considered for the
   extensive data for isotopomers of the LiH molecule. This discussion is
   relevant to a recent claim that the dipole moment and rotational g(J)
   factor of LiH can be determined from a fit to field-free
   vibration-rotation spectra. The values obtained for these quantities are
   unreliable because they are strongly dependent on the constraints used
   in the Born-Oppenheimer-breakdown functions.},

   correction functions from the analysis of high resolution diatomic

   flexible new expressions incorporating those constraints. The utility of
   these new forms is illustrated by a re-analysis of recent high

   an updated potential energy function and more meaningful adiabatic
   (potential) and non-adiabatic (centrifugal) BOB correction functions for

   direct fit of these data to an analytical ``modified Lennard-Jones{''}
   potential energy function involving only 16 fitted parameters yields
   essentially the same quality of fit as did the unconstrained Dunham fit,
   and should be reliable for extrapolation to arbitrarily high J. This
   potential form incorporates the proper R-6 asymptotic behavior of the
   potential, and is constrained to have the theoretically predicted C-6
   dispersion coefficient. Although the dataset involves the three
   isotopomers Rb-85,85(2), Rb-85,87(2), and Rb-87,87(2), none of the
   present analyses was able to determine any Born-Oppenheimer breakdown
   effects.},

   are generated in consideration of kinematic relativistic effects in a

   motion of the nuclei on the vibronic spectra by evaluating matrix
   elements of a rotational Hamiltonian in the basis of uncoupled vibronic
   Born-Oppenheimer functions, including the effects of spin-orbit coupling
   and compare our results to experiment. Moreover, we present predictions
   for experimentally yet unknown transitions by calculating energy levels,
   Omega-, and vibrational splittings of-several excited states},

Abstract = {The coupled channel method for solving the bound-state Schrodinger equation is described. The method has been widely applied to the vibrational-rotational levels of floppy molecules such as Van der Waals complexes, but is also applicable in other areas of physics. It uses a basis set expansion for all degrees of freedom except a radial coordinate, and produces a set of coupled differential equations in the radial coordinate. In modern methods of solution, the coupled equations are solved by propagating the log-derivative of the wavefunction. Eigenvalues are located by searching for zeroes of: the determinant of the ''log-derivative matching matrix'' The resulting methods are very stable, and are the method of choice for providing eigenvalues to very high precision. Some recent advances in the methods, which provide improved convergence on eigenvalues and allow the calculation of wavefunctions, are described.},

abstract = {The isotope dependence of the Dunham vibration-rotation coefficients Ykl of a diatomic molecule is studied. Rovibronic interactions between different electronic states are taken into account by transformation to an effective vibration-rotation Hamiltonian for each electronic state. This contains modified vibrational and rotational reduced masses as well as the adiabatic correction to the potential energy. The effects of these contributions on the vibration-rotation energies are expressed in terms of two functions R̃i(r) and S̃i(r) for each atom i. The resultant formula for Ykl is Ykl=μc−(k+2l)2Ukl{1+meΔklaMa+meΔklbMb+O(me2Mi2)}, where Ukl, Δkla, and Δklb are isotopically invariant, Ma and Mb are the atomic masses, and μc = MaMb(Ma + Mb − Cme) is the atomic reduced mass, modified by the molecular charge number C for charged species. The Ukl with l ≥ 2 can be calculated from those with l = 0 and 1. The corrections UklΔkli are related to the functions R̃i(r) and S̃i(r) and to the Dunham corrections. Recent data for the \{CO\} molecule are discussed, and it is suggested that some large Δkli values are associated with accidentally small Ukl values, since the size of UklΔkli is not directly related to that of Ukl.},
