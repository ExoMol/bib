    abstract = {In this study, we develop and implement a specialized coupled-cluster (CC) approach tailored for accurately describing atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields. Using the open-source Ghent Quantum Chemistry Package (GQCP) in conjunction with the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework (PySCF), we calculate potential energy curves, permanent and transient dipole moments, and vibrational spectra for the diatomic molecules H2, HeH+, and LiH under various magnetic field strengths, adopting a fully non-perturbative treatment. The main computational difficulties stem from the inclusion of the magnetic field in the Hamiltonian, in particular, from the presence of the angular momentum operator, which leads to a complication of the wave function and introduces a gauge-origin dependence. Addressing these challenges requires advanced modifications to existing routines, which we achieve by implementing gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs) by using GQCP and the capabilities offered by PySCF. This approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of the CC theory, opening pathways for more comprehensive investigations in molecular quantum chemistry at strong magnetic fields.},

Title = {{A strict and internally consistent diabatic representation for coupled
   N-state diatomics: A hybrid asymptotic-property-based
   diabatization method}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {162},
Abstract = {A robust regularization procedure for the radial non-adiabatic coupling
   (NAC) elements of the diatomic nuclear kinetic energy operator for the
   N-state diatomic problem is presented. This method ensures NACs are
   internally consistent with each other and with corresponding adiabatic
   properties, such as potentials or dipoles. Constructing a diabatic
   representation-where all components of the (radial) nuclear derivative
   couplings vanish-that is both physical and exactly equivalent to the
   adiabatic representation can be impossible due to inconsistencies
   between NACs and adiabatic properties. Such discrepancies arise from
   using different theory levels in ab initio molecular property
   calculations, convergence issues in quantum chemistry calculations,
   post-processing adjustments to computed property curves, and truncation
   errors when considering only a finite number of Born-Oppenheimer states.
   The presented regularization procedure leverages a hybrid
   asymptotic-property-based diabatization (HyAP), where the asymptotic
   behavior of diabatic properties is addressed and their smoothness
   maximized simultaneously. This is achieved through optimization of the
   trajectory of the adiabatic to diabatic transformation (AtDT)
   parameterized by the corresponding generator matrices (exponential
   mapping). The presented methodology is applied to the 3-state system of
   N-2 {[}1(1)Sigma(+)1, 2(1)Sigma(+)1, and 3(1)Sigma(+)1] and the 4-state
   system of CH {[}C-2 Sigma(+), 2(2)Sigma(+), 3(2)Sigma(+), and
   4(2)Sigma(+)] via evolution of the AtDT, where a physical diabatization
   is achieved. The HyAP regularization, developed and tested for
   applications in spectroscopy, is guided by underlying electronic
   structure data to fulfill our pragmatic aim of constructing physical
   diabatic representations that effectively controls bound rovibronic
   molecular spectroscopy while remaining exactly equivalent to the
   adiabatic representation.},

Title = {VIBFREQ1295: A New Database for Vibrational Frequency Calculations},
Journal = JPCA,
Abstract = {High-throughput approaches for producing approximate vibrational
   spectral data for molecules of astrochemistry interest rely on harmonic
   frequency calculations using computational quantum chemistry. However,
   model chemistry recommendations (i.e., a level of theory and basis set
   pair) for these calculations are not yet available and, thus, thorough
   benchmarking against comprehensive benchmark databases is needed. Here,
   we present a new database for vibrational frequency calculations
   (VIBFREQ1295) storing 1295 experimental fundamental frequencies and
   CCSD(T)(F12{*})/cc-pVDZ-F12 ab initio harmonic frequencies from 141
   molecules. VIBFREQ1295-s experimental data was complied through a
   comprehensive review of contemporary experimental data, while the ab
   initio data was computed here. The chemical space spanned by the
   molecules chosen is considered in-depth and is shown to have good
   representation of common organic functional groups and vibrational
   modes. Scaling factors are routinely used to approximate the effect of
   anharmonicity and convert computed harmonic frequencies to predicted
   fundamental frequencies. With our experimental and high-level ab initio
   data, we find that a single global uniform scaling factor of 0.9617(3)
   results in median differences of 15.9(5) cm(-1). A far superior
   performance with a median difference of 7.5(5) cm(-1) can be obtained,
   however, by using separate scaling factors (SFs) for three regions:
   frequencies less than 1000 cm(-1) (SF = 0.987(1)), between 1000 and 2000
   cm(-1) (SF = 0.9727(6)), and above 2000 cm(-1) (SF = 0.9564(4)). This
   sets a lower bound for the performance that could be reliably obtained
   using scaling of harmonic frequency calculations to predict experimental
   fundamental frequencies. VIBFREQ1295-s most important purpose is to
   provide a robust database for benchmarking the performance of any
   vibrational frequency calculations. VIBFREQ1295 data could also be used
   to train machine-learning models for the prediction of vibrational
   spectra and as a reference and data starting point for more detailed
   spectroscopic modeling of particular molecules. The database can be
   found as part of the Supporting Information for this paper or in the
   Harvard DataVerse at https://doi.org/10.7910/ DVN/VLVNU7.},

abstract = {Abstract Accurate and comprehensive diatomic molecular spectroscopic data have long been vital in a wide variety of applications for measuring and monitoring astrophysical, industrial, and other gaseous environments. These data are also used extensively for benchmarking quantum chemistry and applications from quantum computers, ultracold chemistry and the search for physics beyond the standard model. Useful data can be highly detailed like line lists or summative like molecular constants, and obtained from theory, experiment, or a combination. There are plentiful (though not yet sufficient) data available, but these data are often scattered. For example, molecular constants have not been compiled since 1979 despite the existing compilation still being cited more than 200 times annually. Furthermore, the data are interconnected but updates in one type of data are not yet routinely applied to update interconnected data: in particular, new experimental and ab initio data are not routinely unified with other data on the molecule. This paper provides information and strategies to strengthen the connection between data producers (e.g., ab initio electronic structure theorists and experimental spectroscopists), data modelers (e.g., line list creators and others who connect data on one aspect of the molecule to the full energetic and spectroscopic description) and data users (astronomers, chemical physicists, etc.). All major data types are described including their source, use, compilation, and interconnectivity. Explicit advice is provided for theoretical and experimental data producers, data modelers, and data users to facilitate optimal use of new data with appropriate attribution.

With such a purpose fifty functions were selected. For all of them, motivation and the main mathematical features are discussed. Our goal is to provide a chronological pathway to the reader, even with little knowledge on the subject, to understand how to calculate each parameter that composes the interatomic potentials, as well as obtain spectroscopic constants from them.

Title = {{Molecules as magnetic probes of starspots}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{576}},
Abstract = {{Context. Stellar dynamo processes can be explored by measuring the
   magnetic field. This is usually obtained using the atomic and molecular
   Zeeman effect in spectral lines. While the atomic Zeeman effect can only
   access warmer regions, the use of molecular lines is of advantage for
   studying cool objects. The molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH are suited
   to probe stellar magnetic fields, each one for a different range of
   spectral types, by considering the signal that is obtained from modeling
   various spectral types.
   Aims. We have analyzed the usefulness of different molecules (MgH, TiO,
   CaH, and FeH) as diagnostic tools for studying stellar magnetism on
   active G-K-M dwarfs. We investigate the temperature range in which the
   selected molecules can serve as indicators for magnetic fields on highly
   active cool stars and present synthetic Stokes profiles for the modeled
   spectral type.
   Methods. We modeled a star with a spot size of 10\% of the stellar disk
   and a spot comprising either only longitudinal or only transverse
   magnetic fields and estimated the strengths of the polarization Stokes V
   and Q signals for the molecules MgH, TiO, CaH, and FeH. We combined
   various photosphere and spot models according to realistic scenarios.
   Results. In G dwarfs, the molecules MgH and FeH show overall the
   strongest Stokes V and Q signals from the starspot, whereas FeH has a
   stronger Stokes V signal in all G dwarfs with a spot temperature of 3800
   K. In K dwarfs, CaH signals are generally stronger, and the TiO
   signature is most prominent in M dwarfs.
   Conclusions. Modeling synthetic polarization signals from starspots for
   a range of G-K-M dwarfs leads to differences in the prominence of
   various molecular signatures in different wavelength regions, which
   helps to efficiently select targets and exposure times for observations.}},

   similar to 1 millikelvin); this has enabled advances in areas that range
   fromoptical clocks to the study of ultracold collisions, while also
   serving as the ubiquitous starting point for further cooling into the
   regime of quantum degeneracy. Magneto-optical trapping of molecules
   could provide a similarly powerful starting point for the study and
   manipulation of ultracold molecular gases. The additional degrees of
   freedom associated with the vibration and rotation of molecules,
   particularly their permanent electric dipole moments, allow a broad
   array of applications not possible with ultracold atoms(1). Spurred by
   these ideas, a variety of methods has been developed to create ultracold
   molecules. Temperatures below 1 microkelvin have been demonstrated for
   diatomic molecules assembled from pre-cooled alkali atoms(2,3), but for
   the wider range of species amenable to direct cooling and trapping, only
   recently have temperatures below 100 millikelvin been achieved(4,5). The
   complex internal structure of molecules complicates magneto-optical
   trapping. However, ideas and methods necessary for creating a molecular
   MOT have been developed(6-11) recently. Here we demonstrate three
   dimensional magneto-optical trapping of a diatomic molecule, strontium
   monofluoride (SrF), at a temperature of approximately 2.5 millikelvin,
   the lowest yet achieved by direct cooling of a molecule. This method is
   a straightforward extension of atomic techniques and is expected to be
   viable for a significant number of diatomic species(6,7). With further
   development, we anticipate that this techniquemay be employed in any
   number of existing and proposed molecular experiments, in applications
   ranging from precision measurement(12) to quantum simulation(13) and
   quantum information(14) to ultracold chemistry(15).},

Abstract = {We present an efficient computational method for calculating the binding

   channels to be included. This is particularly important in the vicinity
   of avoided crossings between bound states. We characterize a number of
   different avoided crossings in Cs-2 and compare our converged
   calculations with experimental results. Small but significant
   discrepancies are observed in both crossing strengths and level
   positions, especially for levels with l symmetry (rotational angular

The method is valid for arbitrary values of the total electronic spin and of the magnetic field strength—that is, it holds for molecular electronic states of any multiplicity and for both the Zeeman and incomplete Paschen-Back regimes. It is based on an efficient numerical diagonalization of the effective Zeeman Hamiltonian, which can incorporate easily all the contributions one may eventually be interested in, such as the hyperfine interaction of the external magnetic field with the spin motions of the nuclei. The reliability of the method is demonstrated by comparing our results with previous ones obtained via formulae valid only for doublet states. We also present results for molecular transitions arising between nondoublet electronic states, illustrating that their Zeeman patterns show signatures produced by the Paschen-Back effect.}

Abstract = {The inversion of diatomic vibration-rotation data to give the r
   dependence of operators is considered. For the Born-Oppenheimer energy
   levels E-vJ and for the expectation values
   <vJ\textbackslash{}X(r)\textbackslash{}vJ> of an operator X(r), the
   inversion is unambiguous if the reduced mass is known, leading to the
   potential energy function V(r) and to X(r). The breakdown of the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation is represented in terms of three
   functions Q(i)(r), R-i(r), and S-i(r) for each atom i. The function
   Q(i)(r) can be removed by a transformation that changes the other
   functions to (R) over tilde (i)(r) and (S) over tilde (i)(r), which
   still have one degree of indeterminacy. The effects of this
   indeterminacy in fits to truncated Hamiltonians is considered for the
   extensive data for isotopomers of the LiH molecule. This discussion is
   relevant to a recent claim that the dipole moment and rotational g(J)
   factor of LiH can be determined from a fit to field-free
   vibration-rotation spectra. The values obtained for these quantities are
   unreliable because they are strongly dependent on the constraints used

Pages = {175-187},
Abstract = {The empirical determination of Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB)
   correction functions from the analysis of high resolution diatomic
   molecule spectra is becoming increasingly common. However, in virtually
   all applications to date, the analytic expressions used to represent
   those functions have unphysical limiting behaviour which makes the
   resulting overall potential energy functions unusable at long-range.
   This paper delineates the limiting physical constraints, which should be
   imposed on the form of such BOB correction functions, and presents
   flexible new expressions incorporating those constraints. The utility of
   these new forms is illustrated by a re-analysis of recent high
   resolution IR data for the ground electronic state of AgH, which yields
   an updated potential energy function and more meaningful adiabatic
   (potential) and non-adiabatic (centrifugal) BOB correction functions for
   this system. Further examination of this AgH system also illustrates the
   problem of model dependence associated with efforts to determine
   physically unique potential energy and centrifugal BOB correction

  abstract = {A method of analysis is proposed and applied to the rotational spectra
	of some diatomic molecules measured in the recent high-precision
	experiments. Such a spectrum is usually fitted by an 8th order polynomial
	assuming that the spectrum is a smooth function of angular momentum
	(the total angular momentum of the system). As a matter of fact,
	the measured spectra often show some irregularities (deviations from
	a smooth behavior) and this becomes clearly visible if one analyzes:
	the data in terms of the present method. This method of analysis
	therefore detects at which angular moments the irregularities occur
	in the data and such information would be most useful for understanding
	the nature of the perturbation which is responsible for the occurrence
	of irregularities. How the actual spectra would look like is discussed
	for a few selected cases in terms of simulations.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2000},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {3949-3957},
Abstract = {A flexible new analytical representation for the internuclear potential
   energy of a diatomic molecule is proposed and tested. The new model may
   be thought of as a generalization of the prototypical Lennard-Jones
   (2n,n) function, with the form V(R)=D-e{[}1-(R-e/R)(n)e(-beta(z)z)](2),
   where z=(R- R-e)/(R+R-e) is a dimensionless radial distance variable
   which approaches 1 as R -->infinity. This form explicitly incorporates
   the theoretically predicted attractive inverse-power asymptotic behavior
   V(R)=D-C-n/R-n associated with most potential energy curves. This
   ``modified Lennard-Jones{''} (MLJ) function is tested against other
   flexible forms for the potential energy by performing nonlinear
   least-squares fits both to known numerical potential curves and to
   spectroscopic line positions. },

Title = {Direct potential fit analysis of the X (1)Sigma(+)(g) state of Rb-2:
   Nothing else will do!},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2000},
Volume = {113},
Pages = {3067-3076},
Abstract = {High resolution A-X emission data involving vibrational levels of the
   ground X (1)Sigma(g)(+) electronic state up to v' = 113, spanning 99.8\%
   of the potential well, have been acquired for three isotopomers of Rb-2.
   While a good fit (<(sigma)over bar>(f) = 1.03) to the 12 148 transition
   frequencies (with uncertainties +/- 0.001 cm(-1)) is obtained from an
   unconstrained combined-isotopomer Dunham-type analysis, it requires a
   large number (62) of expansion parameters, and the resulting empirical
   centrifugal distortion constants (CDCs) are unreliable for extrapolation
   to higher-J. Moreover, Dunham expansion fits using constrained
   theoretical values of the first six CDCs (up to O-v) fail to properly
   represent the data, as even higher-order CDCs are required. However, a
   direct fit of these data to an analytical ``modified Lennard-Jones{''}
   potential energy function involving only 16 fitted parameters yields
   essentially the same quality of fit as did the unconstrained Dunham fit,
   and should be reliable for extrapolation to arbitrarily high J. This
   potential form incorporates the proper R-6 asymptotic behavior of the
   potential, and is constrained to have the theoretically predicted C-6
   dispersion coefficient. Although the dataset involves the three
   isotopomers Rb-85,85(2), Rb-85,87(2), and Rb-87,87(2), none of the
   present analyses was able to determine any Born-Oppenheimer breakdown
   effects.},

Abstract = {The coupled channel method for solving the bound-state Schrodinger equation is described. The method has been widely applied to the vibrational-rotational levels of floppy molecules such as Van der Waals complexes, but is also applicable in other areas of physics. It uses a basis set expansion for all degrees of freedom except a radial coordinate, and produces a set of coupled differential equations in the radial coordinate. In modern methods of solution, the coupled equations are solved by propagating the log-derivative of the wavefunction. Eigenvalues are located by searching for zeroes of: the determinant of the ''log-derivative matching matrix'' The resulting methods are very stable, and are the method of choice for providing eigenvalues to very high precision. Some recent advances in the methods, which provide improved convergence on eigenvalues and allow the calculation of wavefunctions, are described.},

abstract = {The isotope dependence of the Dunham vibration-rotation coefficients Ykl of a diatomic molecule is studied. Rovibronic interactions between different electronic states are taken into account by transformation to an effective vibration-rotation Hamiltonian for each electronic state. This contains modified vibrational and rotational reduced masses as well as the adiabatic correction to the potential energy. The effects of these contributions on the vibration-rotation energies are expressed in terms of two functions R̃i(r) and S̃i(r) for each atom i. The resultant formula for Ykl is Ykl=μc−(k+2l)2Ukl{1+meΔklaMa+meΔklbMb+O(me2Mi2)}, where Ukl, Δkla, and Δklb are isotopically invariant, Ma and Mb are the atomic masses, and μc = MaMb(Ma + Mb − Cme) is the atomic reduced mass, modified by the molecular charge number C for charged species. The Ukl with l ≥ 2 can be calculated from those with l = 0 and 1. The corrections UklΔkli are related to the functions R̃i(r) and S̃i(r) and to the Dunham corrections. Recent data for the \{CO\} molecule are discussed, and it is suggested that some large Δkli values are associated with accidentally small Ukl values, since the size of UklΔkli is not directly related to that of Ukl.},
