> Abstract = {We report the analysis of two new spectroscopic observations in the
> near-infrared of the super-Earth 55 Cancri e, obtained with the WFC3
> camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope. 55 Cancri e orbits so close
> to its parent star that temperatures much higher than 2000 K are
> expected on its surface. Given the brightness of 55 Cancri, the
> observations were obtained in scanning mode, adopting a very long
> scanning length and a very high scanning speed. We use our specialized
> pipeline to take into account systematics introduced by these
> observational parameters when coupled with the geometrical distortions
> of the instrument. We measure the transit depth per wavelength channel
> with an average relative uncertainty of 22 ppm per visit and find
> modulations that depart from a straight line model with a 6 sigma
> confidence level. These results suggest that 55 Cancri e is surrounded
> by an atmosphere, which is probably hydrogen-rich. Our fully Bayesian
> spectral retrieval code, T-REx, has identified HCN to be the most likely
> molecular candidate able to explain the features at 1.42 and 1.54 mu m.
> While additional spectroscopic observations in a broader wavelength
> range in the infrared will be needed to confirm the HCN detection, we
> discuss here the implications of such a result. Our chemical model,
> developed with combustion specialists, indicates that relatively high
> mixing ratios of HCN may be caused by a high C/O ratio. This result
> suggests this super-Earth is a carbon-rich environment even more exotic
> than previously thought.},

While the first part concentrated on the energy level analysis of the fundamental and the seven strongest hotbands originating in the ν4 and ν5 excited states for both major isotopes [Spectrochim. Acta 48A, 1203 (1992)], this article summarizes the results of the analysis of the hotbands 2ν4 + ν5 ← 2ν4, ν4 + 2ν5 ← ν4 + ν5, and 3ν5 ← 2ν5 from which improved molecular constants for the 2ν4 and three quantum energy levels were derived for the major isotope $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$. The mixing levels within the excited vibrational states due to vibrational and rotational ℓ-resonance effects are discussed which lead to the identification of the strong “forbidden” Δℓ 3 band, 2ν4+ ν35←2νOe4 as a result of ℓ-resonance intensity perturbation.}

Except for the 2ν2f5 ← ν1f5 hot band, strong intensity perturbation due to l-type doubling and resonances have been quantitatively determined for all hot bands. The zeroth-order vibrational dipole moment derivative for the ν5 bending mode is identical within 10$\%$ for all bands observed. Since an extra factor of 12 appears in the square vibrational transition moment for the combination band, its intensity is reduced by half and is comparable in magnitude to the 2ν5 ← ν5 hot bands.

< abstract = {Abstract Six studies have been recently devoted to a systematic analysis of the high-resolution near infrared absorption spectrum of acetylene recorded by Cavity Ring Down spectroscopy (CRDS) in Grenoble and by Fourier-transform spectroscopy (FTS) in Brussels and Hefei. On the basis of these works, in the present contribution, we construct an empirical database for acetylene in the 5850  9415 cm1 region excluding the 63417000 cm1 interval corresponding to the very strong 1+3 manifold. Our database gathers and extends information included in our CRDS and FTS studies. In particular, the intensities of about 1700 lines measured by CRDS in the 72447920 cm1 are reported for the first time together with those of several bands of 12C13CH2 present in natural isotopic abundance in the acetylene sample. The Herman-Wallis coefficients of most of the bands are derived from a fit of the measured intensity values. A recommended line list is provided with positions calculated using empirical spectroscopic parameters of the lower and upper energy vibrational levels and intensities calculated using the derived Herman-Wallis coefficients. This approach allows completing the experimental list by adding missing lines and improving poorly determined positions and intensities. As a result the constructed line list includes a total of 10973 lines belonging to 146 bands of $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ and 29 bands of 12C13CH2. For comparison the HITRAN database in the same region includes 869 lines of 14 bands, all belonging to $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$. Our weakest lines have an intensity on the order of 1029 cm/molecule, about three orders of magnitude smaller than the HITRAN intensity cut off. Line profile parameters are added to the line list which is provided in HITRAN format. The comparison of our acetylene database to the HITRAN line list or to results obtained using the global effective operator approach is discussed in terms of completeness and accuracy. }

< abstract = {Abstract A new recommended $^{12}$C$_2$H$_2$ line list for the 13  248 cm1 and 390  634 cm1 regions is presented. It is based on the results of the global modeling of the line positions and intensities performed in Tomsk within the framework of the method of effective operators. To validate the Tomsk calculations new measurements of both line positions and intensities were performed using acetylene spectra recorded between 25 and 680 cm1 with the AILES-A beamline of SOLEIL synchrotron. Line positions and intensities of 627 transitions belonging to 9 bands have been measured for the first time in this region. Using the results of these new measurements and the published results of the measurements in the 13  248 cm1 and 390  634 cm1 regions performed with the same facilities new fittings of the line intensities for the P = 0 and P = 1 series of transitions have been performed. Here P = 5v1 + 3v2 + 5v3 + v4 + v5 is a polyad number, where v1, v2, v3, v4, and v5 are the principal quantum numbers of the acetylene harmonic oscillators. These new sets of the effective dipole moment parameters were used to generate the line list which contains the line positions and intensities of 39 and 29 bands, respectively for the P = 0 and P = 1 series of transitions. None of these bands is present in the HITRAN 2012 and GEISA 2015 databases. This paper presents the first part of a global work on the validation of Tomsk calculations.}
