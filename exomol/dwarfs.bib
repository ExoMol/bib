Title = {{HCN and C$_2$H$_2$ in the Atmosphere of a T8.5+T9 Brown
   Dwarf Binary}},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {981},
Abstract = {T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres
   teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4, and NH3, which exhibit a wealth
   of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally
   explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs
   that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise
   derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn inform our
   understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide
   clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This
   study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R similar to
   1500-3000) of a T dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE
   J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T
   profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis),
   treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free
   atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4, and NH3 features. Moreover, we make
   the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4 sigma and 9.5 sigma
   respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN
   suggests intense vertical mixing (Kzz similar to 1011 cm2 s-1),
   challenging previous literature derivations of Kzz values for T-type
   brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot
   be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This
   result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing and/or our
   understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards more
   complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae or
   lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in
   studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.},

Title = {{The MSG model for cloudy sub-stellar atmospheres A grid of
   self-consistent sub-stellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud
   formation}},
Journal =AA,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {694},
Abstract = {Context. State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented
   views into the atmospheres of sub-stellar objects in the infrared,
   further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models
   struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at similar to 10
   mu m observed in sub-stellar atmospheres. Aims. In the MSG model, we aim
   to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model
   with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium cloud formation model
   DRIFT, also known as StaticWeather, to create a new grid of
   self-consistent cloudy sub-stellar atmosphere models with microphysical
   cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce
   the silicate cloud absorption feature at similar to 10 mu m. Methods. We
   modelled sub-stellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the
   range Teff = 1200-2500 K and with log(g) = 4.0. We computed atmospheric
   structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities
   based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on
   control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic
   atmosphere spectra were computed for each model to explore the
   observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explored
   the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO2 or SiO) and
   the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra.
   Results. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO2 nucleation shows spectra
   that are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known
   population of sub-stellar atmospheres. We find that the models with SiO
   nucleation and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the
   near-infrared. Conclusions. We present a new grid of MSG models for
   cloudy sub-stellar atmospheres that include cloud radiative feedback
   from microphysical clouds. The grid is unable to reproduce silicate
   features similar to the ones found in recent JWST observations and
   Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may
   better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and
   steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.},

Abstract = {We present a new grid of cloudy atmosphere and evolution models for
   substellar objects. These models include the effect of refractory cloud
   species, including silicate clouds, on the spectra and evolution. We
   include effective temperatures from 900 to 2400 K and surface gravities
   from log g = 3.5 to 5.5, appropriate for a broad range of objects with
   masses between 1 and 84 M J. Model pressure-temperature structures are
   calculated assuming radiative-convective and chemical equilibrium. We
   consider the effect of both clouds and metallicity on the atmospheric
   structure, resulting spectra, and thermal evolution of substellar
   worlds. We parameterize clouds using the A. S. Ackerman \& M. S. Marley
   cloud model, including cloud parameter f sed values from 1 to 8; we
   include three metallicities (-0.5, 0.0, and +0.5). Refractory clouds and
   metallicity both alter the evolution of substellar objects, changing the
   inferred temperature at a given age by up to 100-200 K. For
   solar-metallicity evolution models including clouds in warm objects, we
   find a hydrogen-burning minimum mass of 70.2 M J, close to empirical
   measurements; we find a deuterium-burning minimum mass of 12.05 M J
   (50\% of initial D burned). We compare to the observed photometry of
   brown dwarfs, finding broad agreement with the measured photometry. We
   publish the spectra, evolution, and other data products online with open
   access on Zenodo (doi:10.5281/zenodo.12735103).},

Journal = AJ,
Year = {2024},
Volume = {167},
Abstract = {The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) marks a pivotal
   moment for precise atmospheric characterization of Y dwarfs, the coldest
   brown dwarf spectral type. In this study, we leverage moderate spectral
   resolution observations (R similar to 2700) with the G395H grating of
   the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST to characterize
   the nearby (9.9 pc) Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8. With the NIRSpec
   G395H 2.88-5.12 mu m spectrum, we measure the abundances of CO, CO2,
   CH4, H2S, NH3, and H2O, which are the major carbon-, nitrogen-, oxygen-,
   and sulfur-bearing species in the atmosphere. Based on the retrieved
   volume mixing ratios with the atmospheric retrieval framework CHIMERA,
   we report that the C/O ratio is 0.45 +/- 0.01, close to the solar C/O
   value of 0.458, and the metallicity is +0.30 +/- 0.02 dex. Comparison
   between the retrieval results and the forward modeling results suggests
   that the model bias for C/O and metallicity could be as high as 0.03 and
   0.97 dex, respectively. We also report a lower limit of the
   (CO)-C-12/(CO)-C-13 ratio of >40, being consistent with the nominal
   solar value of 90. Our results highlight the potential for JWST to
   measure the C/O ratios down to percent-level precision and characterize
   isotopologues of cold planetary atmospheres similar to WISE 1828.},

   abstract = {About 70%-80% of stars in our solar and Galactic neighborhood are M dwarfs. They span a range of low masses and temperatures relative to solar-type stars, facilitating molecule formation throughout their atmospheres. Standard stellar atmosphere models primarily designed for FGK stars face challenges when characterizing broadband molecular features in spectra of cool stars. Here, we introduce SPHINX—a new 1D self-consistent radiative-convective thermochemical equilibrium chemistry model grid of atmospheres and spectra for M dwarfs in low resolution (R ∼ 250). We incorporate the latest precomputed absorption cross sections with pressure broadening for key molecules dominant in late-K, early/main-sequence-M stars. We then validate our grid models by determining fundamental properties (T eff, log g, [M/H], radius, and C/O) for 10 benchmark M+G binary stars with known host metallicities and 10 M dwarfs with interferometrically measured angular diameters. Incorporating the Gaussian process inference tool Starfish, we account for correlated and systematic noise in low-resolution (spectral stitching of SpeX, SNIFS, and STIS) observations and derive robust estimates of fundamental M-dwarf atmospheric parameters. Additionally, we assess the influence of photospheric heterogeneity on inferred [M/H] and find that it could explain some deviations from observations. We also probe whether the adopted convective mixing length parameter influences inferred radii, effective temperature, and [M/H] and again find that may explain discrepancies between interferometric observations and model-derived parameters for cooler M dwarfs. Mainly, we show the unique strength in leveraging broadband molecular absorption features occurring in low-resolution M dwarf spectra and demonstrate the ability to improve constraints on fundamental properties of exoplanet hosts and brown-dwarf companions.}

Our spectra were obtained using several optical spectrometers with spectral resolutions that range from 1200 to 10000. As many as 97\\% of the observed M-type dwarfs have a spectral type of M3-M6, with a typical error of 0.4 subtype, among which the spectral types M4-M5 are the most common. We infer the Teff of our sample by fitting our spectra with theoretical spectra from the PHOENIX model. Our inferred Teff is calibrated with the optical spectra of M dwarfs whose Teff have been well determined with the calibrations that are supported by previous interferometric observations. Our fitting procedures utilize the VO absorption band (7320-7570 Å) and the optical region (5000-8000 Å), yielding typical errors of 128 K (VO band) and 85 K (optical region). We also determine the radii of our sample from their spectral energy distributions. We find most of our sample stars have radii of \\&lt;0.6 R⊙, with the average error being 3\\%. Our catalog enables efficient sample selection for exoplanet surveys around nearby M-type dwarfs.}},

   Abstract = {{Rotational modulations are observed on brown dwarfs and directly imaged
      exoplanets, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here we
      analyze Jupiter's rotational light curves at 12 wavelengths from the
      ultraviolet (UV) to the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The peak-to-peak
      amplitudes of Jupiter's light curves range from subpercent to 4\% at
      most wavelengths, but the amplitude exceeds 20\% at 5 mu m, a wavelength
      sensing Jupiter's deep troposphere. Jupiter's rotational modulations are
      primarily caused by discrete patterns in the cloudless belts instead of
      the cloudy zones. The light-curve amplitude is controlled by the sizes
      and brightness contrasts of the Great Red Spot (GRS), expansions of the
      North Equatorial Belt (NEB), patchy clouds in the North Temperate Belt
      (NTB), and a train of hot spots in the NEB. In reflection, the contrast
      is controlled by upper tropospheric and stratospheric hazes, clouds, and
      chromophores in the clouds. In thermal emission, the small rotational
      variability is caused by the spatial distribution of temperature and
      opacities of gas and aerosols; the large variation is caused by the NH3
      cloud holes and thin-thick clouds. The methane-band light curves exhibit
      opposite-shape behavior compared with the UV and visible wavelengths,
      caused by a wavelength-dependent brightness change of the GRS.
      Light-curve evolution is induced by periodic events in the belts and
      longitudinal drifting of the GRS and patchy clouds in the NTB. This
      study suggests several interesting mechanisms related to distributions
      of temperature, gas, hazes, and clouds for understanding the observed
      rotational modulations on brown dwarfs and exoplanets.}},

   Abstract = {{The coldest brown dwarf, WISE 0855, is the closest known planetary-mass,
      free-floating object and has a temperature nearly as cold as the solar
      system gas giants. Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere
      rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE
      0855 is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its
      energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer et al. presented a spectrum of WISE
      0855 from 4.5-5.1 mu m (M band), revealing water vapor features. Here,
      we present a spectrum of WISE 0855 in the L band, from 3.4-4.14 mu m. We
      present a set of atmosphere models that include a range of compositions
      (metallicities and C/O ratios) and water ice clouds. Methane absorption
      is clearly present in the spectrum. The mid-infrared color can be better
      matched with a methane abundance that is depleted relative to solar
      abundance. We find that there is evidence for water ice clouds in the M
      band spectrum, and we find a lack of phosphine spectral features in both
      the L and M band spectra. We suggest that a deep continuum opacity
      source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a deep
      phosphorous-bearing cloud, ammonium dihyrogen phosphate. Observations of
      WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres,
      bridging the temperature range between the long-studied solar system
      planets and accessible exoplanets. The James Webb Space Telescope will
      soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with
      high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study
      their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric
      dynamics and formation processes.}},

   Volume = {787},
   Abstract = {The formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres of
      nearly all effective temperatures. Iron and silicate condense in L dwarf
      atmospheres and dissipate at the L/T transition. Minor species such as
      sulfides and salts condense in mid- to late T dwarfs. For brown dwarfs
      below T-eff similar to 450 K, water condenses in the upper atmosphere to
      form ice clouds. Currently, over a dozen objects in this temperature
      range have been discovered, and few previous theoretical studies have
      addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf or exoplanetary
      spectra. Here we present a new grid of models that include the effect of
      water cloud opacity. We find that they become optically thick in objects
      below T-eff similar to 350-375 K. Unlike refractory cloud materials,
      water-ice particles are significantly nongray absorbers; they
      predominantly scatter at optical wavelengths through the J band and
      absorb in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest of which
      is at 2.8 mu m. H2O, NH3, CH4, and H-2 CIA are dominant opacity sources;
      less abundant species may also be detectable, including the alkalis,
      H2S, and PH3. PH3, which has been detected in Jupiter, is expected to
      have a strong signature in the mid-infrared at 4.3 mu m in Y dwarfs
      around T-eff = 450 K; if disequilibrium chemistry increases the
      abundance of PH3, it may be detectable over a wider effective
      temperature range than models predict. We show results incorporating
      disequilibrium nitrogen and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of
      low gravity in planetary mass objects. Finally, we make predictions for
      the observability of Y dwarfs and planets with existing and future

      several hydrocarbon molecules and cyanopolyyne molecules can be present.
      An increase in surface gravity and/or a decrease in metallicity support
      the increase in the partial pressures of these species. CO, CO2, CH4 and
      HCN contain the largest fraction of carbon. In the upper atmosphere of
      low-metallicity objects, more carbon is contained in C4H than in CO, and

   Abstract = {The discovery of a new spectral class - the Y dwarfs - by NASA's
      Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer has enabled researchers to study the
      physics of the coldest brown dwarfs and to determine the prevalence of
      brown dwarfs in the Milky Way. The boundary between T dwarfs and Y
      dwarfs roughly coincides with the location where the J - H colors of
      brown dwarfs, as predicted by models, turn back to the red at effective
      temperatures below similar to 400 K. Preliminary trigonometric parallax
      measurements show that the T/Y boundary appears also to correspond to
      the point at which the absolute H (1.6 mu m) and W2 (4.6 mu m)
      magnitudes plummet. Using these new distance measurements, it is found
      that hydrogen-burning stars outnumber brown dwarfs by approximately a
      factor of six in the solar neighborhood. Using simulations describing
      the mass function as a power law or as a lognormal, we find that both
      the shape and predicted space densities in the mid-T to early-Y regime
      can be fit only if these functions are normalized downward to better
      reflect the relative paucity of brown dwarfs. The sample of currently
      identified Y dwarfs probes the field mass function to masses of similar
      to 5 MJup, but confirmation of additional, colder Y dwarfs from WISE is
      needed to determine whether the low-mass limit to star formation has yet

   Abstract = {{Context. Despite their large number in the Galaxy, M dwarfs remain
      elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long remained
      a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation).
      Aims. Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres,
      update the M dwarf T-eff-spectral type relation, and find the
      atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample.
      Methods. We compare two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M
      dwarf sequence with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a
      chi(2) minimization technique to determine T-eff. The first sample
      consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology
      Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55
      medium-resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory
      (SSO). The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already
      classified M dwarfs.
      Results. We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope
      of the spectral energy distribution and most of its features. Only the
      CaOH band at 5570 angstrom and AlH and NaH hydrides in the blue part of
      the spectra are still missing in the models. The T-eff scale obtained
      with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m spectra is consistent with that
      obtained with the NTT spectra. We compare our T-eff scale with those of
      other authors and with published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors.
      We also present relations between effective temperature, spectral type,
      and colors of the M dwarfs.}},

   Abstract = {We present the discovery of seven ultracool brown dwarfs identified with
      the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Near-infrared
      spectroscopy reveals deep absorption bands of H2O and CH4 that indicate
      all seven of the brown dwarfs have spectral types later than UGPS
      J072227.51-054031.2, the latest-type T dwarf currently known. The
      spectrum of WISEP J182831.08+ 265037.8 is distinct in that the heights
      of the J- and H-band peaks are approximately equal in units of f lambda,
      so we identify it as the archetypal member of the Y spectral class. The
      spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorption on
      the blue wing of the H-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to NH3.
      These spectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between
      the T dwarfs and the Y dwarfs. In order to produce a smooth
      near-infrared spectral sequence across the T/Y dwarf transition, we have
      reclassified UGPS 0722-05 as the T9 spectral standard and tentatively
      assign WISEP J173835.52+ 273258.9 as the Y0 spectral standard. In total,
      six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classified as Y dwarfs: four are
      classified as Y0, one is classified as Y0 (pec?), and WISEP J1828+ 2650
      is classified as > Y0. We have also compared the spectra to the model
      atmospheres of Marley and Saumon and infer that the brown dwarfs have
      effective temperatures ranging from 300 K to 500 K, making them the
      coldest spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs known to date.},

      projected rotational velocity of nine T dwarfs from the comparison of
      high-resolution near-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate
      the mass and age of the objects from state-of-the-art models.
      Methods. We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar metallicity models
      provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of nine T-type field
      dwarfs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph
      NIRSPEC using ten echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.147
      to 1.347 mu m with a resolving power R similar to 20 000. The projected
      rotational velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity of the
      objects are determined based on the minimum root mean square of the
      differences between the modelled and observed relative fluxes. Estimates
      of the mass and age of the objects are obtained from effective
      temperature-surface gravity diagrams, where our results are compared
      with existing solar metallicity models.
      Results. The modelled spectra reproduce quite well the observed features
      for most of the T dwarfs, with effective temperatures in the range of
      922-1009 K, and surface gravities between 10(4.1) and 10(4.9) cm s(-2).
      Our results support the assumption of a dust free atmosphere for T
      dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and then gravitationally
      sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra do not accurately
      mimic some individual very strong lines like the Ki doublet at 1.2436
      and 1.2525 mu m. Our modelled spectra does not match well the observed
      spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely SDSSp
      J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is
      likely due to the presence of condensate clouds that are not
      incorporated in the models used here. By comparing our results and their
      uncertainties to evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval
      approximate to 5-75 M(J) for T dwarfs later than T5, which are in good
      agreement with those found in the literature. We found apparent young
      ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for the same T dwarfs,
      which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.},

      spectra (similar to 0.6-2.5 mu m), as well as red through mid-infrared
      spectroscopy of seven other L and T dwarfs presented by Cushing et al.
      We compare these spectra to those generated from the model atmospheres
      of Saumon \& Marley. The models reproduce the observed spectra well,
      except in the case of one very red L3.5 dwarf, 2MASS J22244381-0158521.
      The broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almost
      independently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in
      our models: effective temperature (T(eff)), surface gravity, grain
      sedimentation efficiency (f(sed)), and vertical gas transport efficiency
      (K(zz)). The CH(4) bands centered at 2.2, 3.3, and 7.65 mu m and the CO
      band at 2.3 mu m are sensitive to K(zz), and indicates that chemical
      mixing is important in all L and T dwarf atmospheres. The sample of L3.5
      to T5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 K greater than or similar to T(eff)
      greater than or similar to 1000 K, with an L-T transition (spectral
      types L7 to T4) that lies between 1400 and 1100 K for dwarfs with
      typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 K
      warmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. When
      using optical spectral types, the bluer dwarfs have more typical T(eff)
      values as they tend to have earlier optical spectral types. In this
      model analysis, f(sed) increases rapidly between types T0 and T4,
      indicating that increased sedimentation can explain the rapid
      disappearance of clouds at this stage of brown dwarf evolution. There is
      a suggestion that the transition to dust-free atmospheres happens at
      lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.},

   Abstract = {{Aims. We determine carbon, oxygen, and their isotopic abundances based
      on CO and OH spectra in 23 red giant stars, and identify possible origin
      of difficulty in abundance analysis of cool luminous stars.
      Methods. We apply the line-by-line analysis based on the classical
      micro-turbulent model and 1D model photospheres.
      Results. We found empirically that there is a critical value of log W/nu
      approximate to -4.75 (W is the equivalent width and nu the wavenumber)
      above which the observed lines do not follow the classical line
      formation theory based on the micro-turbulent model and that the
      classical abundance analysis can be applied only to the weak lines of
      log W/nu less than or similar to -4.75. The carbon, oxygen, and their
      isotopic abundances in 23 K-M giant stars obtained from such weak lines
      are approximately consistent with evolutionary models, although the
      (12)C/(13)C puzzle (observed (12)C/(13)C ratios are too small compared
      with theoretical predictions) remains unsolved. It is already known that
      the strong lines of logW/nu > -4.4 are contaminated by the contribution
      from outer molecular layers. The less strong but saturated lines of
      -4.75 < logW/nu less than or similar to -4.4 (intermediate-strength
      lines) cannot be understood at all with the abundance and turbulent
      velocity based on the weak lines. By studying the behavior of these
      lines and considering other observations such as the detection of H(2)O
      lines, not only in the late M giants but also in the early M and K
      giants, we show that the intermediate-strength lines are essentially
      identical to the strong lines in that they also include contamination
      from the extra molecular layers. Thus, the behavior of the
      intermediate-strength lines, including those with LEP as high as 2eV,
      appears to be nothing but a manifestation of the warm molecular envelope
      or MOLsphere.
      Conclusions. The infrared spectra of K-M giant stars are a hybrid of at
      least two components originating in the photosphere and MOL sphere. Only
      the weak lines, mostly high excitation, are relatively free from the
      effect of MOLsphere and can be used to extract photospheric abundances.
      The strong lines and the intermediate-strength lines, which dominate the
      observed infrared spectra, are affected badly by contamination from the
      MOLsphere. For this reason, they provide little information about the
      photosphere, but instead can be important proves of the warm molecular
      envelope for which little is known yet. In the interpretation and
      analysis of the infrared spectra of K-M giant stars, it is essential to
      consider their hybrid nature.}},

      distributions of nine field ultracool dwarfs with spectral types ranging
      from L1 to T4.5. Effective temperatures, gravities, and condensate cloud
      sedimentation efficiencies are derived by comparing the data to
      synthetic spectra computed from atmospheric models that
      self-consistently include the formation of condensate clouds. Overall,
      the model spectra fit the data well, although the agreement at some
      wavelengths remains poor due to remaining inadequacies in the models.
      Derived effective temperatures decrease steadily through the L1-T4.5
      spectral types, and we confirm that the effective temperatures of
      ultracool dwarfs at the L/T transition are nearly constant, decreasing
      by only similar to 200 K from spectral types L7.5 to T4.5. The
      condensate cloud properties vary significantly among the L dwarfs in our
      sample, ranging from very thick clouds to relatively thin clouds with no
      particular trend with spectral type. The two objects in our sample with
      very red J - K(s) colors are, however, best fitted with synthetic
      spectra that have thick clouds, which hints at a possible correlation
      between the near-infrared colors of L dwarfs and the condensate cloud
      properties. The fits to the two T dwarfs in our sample (T2 and T4.5)
      also suggest that the clouds become thinner in this spectral class, in
      agreement with previous studies. Restricting the fits to narrower
      wavelength ranges (i.e., individual photometric bands) almost always
      yields excellent agreement between the data and models. Limitations in
      our knowledge of the opacities of key absorbers such as FeH, VO, and
      CH(4) at certain wavelengths remain obvious, however. The effective
      temperatures obtained by fitting the narrower wavelength ranges can show
      a large scatter compared to the values derived by fitting the full
      spectral energy distributions; deviations are typically similar to 200 K

Through deep, I -, z '-, J -, H -, and K -band photometry of a 20' x 20' field in OMC 2/3, we selected brown dwarf candidates for follow-up spectroscopy. Low-resolution far-red and near-infrared spectra were obtained for the candidates, and 19 young brown dwarfs in the OMC 2/3 region are confirmed. They exhibit spectral types of M6.5-M9, corresponding to approximate masses of 0.075-0.015 M ☉ using the evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. At least one of these bona fide young brown dwarfs has strong Hα emission, indicating that it is actively accreting. In addition, we confirm 21 new low-mass members with spectral types of M4-M6, corresponding to approximate masses of 0.35-0.10 M ☉ in OMC 2/3. By comparing pre-main-sequence tracks to the positions of the members in the H-R diagram, we find that most of the brown dwarfs are less than 1 Myr, but find a number of low-mass stars with inferred ages greater than 3 Myr. The discrepancy in the stellar and substellar ages is due to our selection of only low-luminosity sources; however, the presence of such objects implies the presence of an age spread in the OMC 2/3 region. We discuss possible reasons for this apparent age spread.}

Via spectroscopic selection from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we retrieve 1220 high galactic latitude C stars, ~5 times more than previously known, including a wider variety than past techniques such as color or grism selection have netted, and additionally yielding 167 DQ white dwarfs. Of the C stars with proper motion measurements, we identify 69% clearly as dwarfs (dCs), while ~7% are giants. The dCs likely span absolute magnitudes M i from ~6.5 to 10.5. "G-type" dC stars with weak CN and relatively blue colors are probably the most massive dCs still cool enough to show C 2 bands. We report Balmer emission in 22 dCs, none of which are G-types. We find 8 new DA/dC stars in composite spectrum binaries, quadrupling the total sample of these "smoking guns" for AGB binary mass transfer. Eleven very red C stars with strong red CN bands appear to be "N"-type AGB stars at large Galactocentric distances, one likely a new discovery in the dIrr galaxy Leo A. Two such stars within 30' of each other may trace a previously unidentified dwarf galaxy or tidal stream at ~40 kpc. We explore the multiwavelength properties of the sample and report the first X-ray detection of a dC star, which shows strong Balmer emission. Our own spectroscopic survey additionally provides the dC surface density from a complete sample of dwarfs limited by magnitude, color, and proper motion.}

   Abstract = {A revised near-infrared classification scheme for T dwarfs is presented,
      based on and superseding prior schemes developed by Burgasser and
      coworkers and Geballe and coworkers, and defined following the precepts
      of the MK process. Drawing from two large spectroscopic libraries of T
      dwarfs identified largely in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two
      Micron All Sky Survey, nine primary spectral standards and five
      alternate standards spanning spectral types T0-T8 are identified that
      match criteria of spectral character, brightness, absence of a resolved
      companion, and accessibility from both the Northern and Southern
      Hemispheres. The classification of T dwarfs is formally made by the
      direct comparison of near-infrared spectral data of equivalent
      resolution to the spectra of these standards. Alternately, we have
      redefined five key spectral indices measuring the strengths of the major
      H(2)O and CH(4) bands in the 1-2.5 mu m region that may be used as a
      proxy to direct spectral comparison. Two methods of determining T
      spectral type using these indices are outlined and yield equivalent
      results. These classifications are also equivalent to those from prior
      schemes, implying that no revision of existing spectral type trends is
      required. The one-dimensional scheme presented here provides a first
      step toward the observational characterization of the lowest luminosity
      brown dwarfs currently known. Future extensions to incorporate spectral
      variations arising from differences in photospheric dust content,
      gravity, and metallicity are briefly discussed. A compendium of all
      currently known T dwarfs with updated classifications is presented.},

   abstract = {While following up L dwarf candidates selected photometrically from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, we uncovered an unusual object designated 2MASS J01415823-4633574. Its optical spectrum exhibits very strong bands of vanadium oxide but abnormally weak absorptions by titanium oxide, potassium, and sodium. Morphologically, such spectroscopic characteristics fall intermediate between old field early-L dwarfs [log( g ) ≈ 5] and very late M giants [log( g ) ≈ 0], leading us to favor low gravity as the explanation for the unique spectral signatures of this L dwarf. Such a low gravity can be explained only if this L dwarf is much lower in mass than a typical old field L dwarf of similar temperature and is still contracting to its final radius. These conditions imply a very young age. Further evidence of youth is found in the near-infrared spectrum, including a triangular-shaped H -band continuum, reminiscent of young brown dwarf candidates discovered in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Using the above information along with comparisons to brown dwarf atmospheric and interior models, our current best estimate is that this L dwarf has an age of 1-50 Myr and a mass of 6-25 M J . Although the lack of a lithium detection (pseudo-equivalent width <1 Å) might appear to contradict other evidence of youth, we suggest that lithium becomes weaker at lower gravity like all other alkali lines and thus needs to be carefully considered before being used as a diagnostic of age or mass for objects in this regime. The location of 2MASS 0141-4633 on the sky coupled with a distance estimate of ~35 pc and the above age estimate suggests that this object may be a brown dwarf member of either the 30 Myr old Tucana/Horologium association or the ~12 Myr old β Pic moving group. Distance as determined through trigonometric parallax (underway) and a measure of the total space motion are needed to test this hypothesis.}

      mid-1990s, with a flood of new discoveries occurring in the late 1990s
      with the advent of deep, large-area, digital sky surveys. Over four
      hundred and fifty L and T dwarfs are now cataloged. This review
      concentrates on the spectroscopic properties of these objects, beginning
      with the establishment of classification schemes rooted in the MK
      Process. The resulting grid of spectral types is then used as a tool to
      ferret out the underlying physics. The temperature ranges covered by
      these spectral types, the complex chemical processes responsible for the
      shape of their emergent spectra, their nature as either true stars or
      brown dwarfs, and their number density in the Galaxy are discussed. Two
      promising avenues for future research are also explored: the extension
      of the classification system to three dimensions to account for gravity-
      and metallicity-dependent features, and the capability of newer
      large-area surveys to uncover brown dwarfs cooler than those now
      recognized.},

   abstract = {We report the initial results of the Brown Dwarf Spectroscopic Survey Gravity Project to study gravity sensitive features as indicators of youth in brown dwarfs. Low-resolution ( R ~ 2000) J -band and optical ( R ~ 1000) observations using NIRSPEC and LRIS at the W. M. Keck Observatory reveal transitions of TiO, VO, K I , Na I , Cs I , Rb I , CaH, and FeH. By comparing these features in late-type giants and in old field dwarfs, we show that they are sensitive to the gravity ( g = GM / R 2 ) of the object. Using low-gravity spectral signatures as age indicators, we observed and analyzed J -band and optical spectra of two young brown dwarfs, G196-3B (20-300 Myr) and KPNO Tau 4 (1-2 Myr) and two possible low-mass brown dwarfs in the σ Orionis cluster (3-7 Myr). We report the identification of the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} bands of TiO near 1.24 μm and the A-X band of VO near 1.18 μm together with extremely weak J -band lines of K I in KPNO Tau 4. This is the first detection of TiO and VO in the J band in a substellar-mass object. The optical spectrum of KPNO Tau 4 exhibits weak K I andNa I lines, weak absorption by CaH, and strong VO bands, also signatures of a lower gravity atmosphere. G196-3B shows absorption features in both wavelength regions, like those of KPNO Tau 4, suggesting that its age and mass are at the lower end of published estimates. Whereas σ Ori 51 appears to be consistent with a young substellar object, σ Ori 47 shows signatures of high gravity most closely resembling an old L1.5/L0 and cannot be a member of the σ Orionis cluster.}

   Abstract = {We present 6300-10100 Angstrom spectra for a sample of 13 T dwarfs
      observed using LRIS mounted on the Keck I 10 m Telescope. A variety of
      features are identified and analyzed, including pressure-broadened K I
      and Na I doublets; narrow Cs I and Rb I lines; weak CaH, CrH, and FeH
      bands; strong H(2)O absorption; and a possible weak CH(4) band. Halpha
      emission is detected in three of the T dwarfs, strong in the previously
      reported active T dwarf 2MASS 1237+6526 and weak in SDSS 1254-0122 and
      2MASS 1047+2124. None of the T dwarfs exhibit Li I absorption. Guided by
      the evolution of optical spectral features with near-infrared spectral
      type, we derive a parallel optical classification scheme, focusing on
      spectral types T5 to T8, anchored to select spectral standards. We find
      general agreement between optical and near-infrared types for nearly all
      the T dwarfs so far observed, including two earlier type T dwarfs,
      within our classification uncertainties (similar to1 subtype). These
      results suggest that competing gravity and temperature effects
      compensate for each other over the 0.6-2.5 mum spectral region. We
      identify one possible means of disentangling these effects by comparing
      the strength of the K I red wing to the 9250 Angstrom H(2)O band. One of
      our objects, 2MASS 0937+2931, exhibits a peculiar spectrum with a
      substantial red slope and relatively strong FeH absorption, both
      consequences of a metal-deficient atmosphere. On the basis of its
      near-infrared properties and substantial space motion, this object may
      be a thick disk or halo brown dwarf.},

   Abstract = {We present a spectrum of the cool (T(eff) = 900 K) brown dwarf Gliese
      229B. This spectrum, with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio per
      spectral resolution element (greater than or similar to 30), spans the
      wavelength range from 0.837 mu m to 5.0 mu m. We identify a total of
      four different major methane absorption features, including the
      fundamental band at 3.3 mu m, at least four steam bands, and two neutral
      cesium features. We confirm the recent detection of carbon monoxide (CO)
      in excess of what is predicted by thermochemical equilibrium
      calculations. Carbon is primarily involved in a chemical balance between
      methane and CO at the temperatures and pressures present in the outer
      parts of a brown dwarf. At lower temperatures, the balance favors
      methane, while in the deeper, hotter regions, the reaction reverses to
      convert methane into CO. The presence of CO in the observable part of
      the atmosphere is therefore a sensitive indicator of vertical flows. The
      high signal-to-noise ratio in the 1 mu m to 2.5 mu m region permits us
      to place constraints on the quantity of dust in the atmosphere of the
      brown dwarf. We are unable to reconcile the observed spectrum with
      synthetic spectra that include the presences of dust. The presence of CO
      but lack of dust may be a clue to the location of the boundaries of the
      outer convective region of the atmosphere: The lack of dust may mean
      that it is not being conveyed into the photosphere by convection, or
      that it exists in patchy clouds. If the dust is not in clouds, but
      rather sits below the outer convective region, we estimate that the
      boundary between outer convective and inner radiative layers is between
      1250 K and 1600 K, in agreement with recent models.},
