  abstract = {We report the discovery of a very cool, isolated brown dwarf, UGPS
	0722-05, with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Deep Sky Survey
	(UKIDSS) Galactic Plane Survey. The near-infrared spectrum displays
	deeper H2O and CH4 troughs than the coolest known T dwarfs and an
	unidentified absorption feature at 1.275 mu m. We provisionally classify
	the object as a T10 dwarf but note that it may in future come to
	be regarded as the first example of a new spectral type. The distance
	is measured by trigonometric parallax as d = 4.1(-0.5)(+0.6) pc,
	making it the closest known isolated brown dwarf. With the aid of
	Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) we measure H - {[}4.5] = 4.71.
	It is the coolest brown dwarf presently known - the only known T
	dwarf that is redder in H - {[}4.5] is the peculiar T7.5 dwarf SDSS
	J1416+13B, which is thought to be warmer and more luminous than UGPS
	0722-05. Our measurement of the luminosity, aided by Gemini/T-ReCS
	N-band photometry, is L = 9.2 +/- 3.1 x 10(-7) L-circle dot. Using
	a comparison with well-studied T8.5 and T9 dwarfs we deduce T-eff
	= 520 +/- 40 K. This is supported by predictions of the Saumon \&
	Marley models. With apparent magnitude J = 16.52, UGPS 0722-05 is
	the brightest of the similar to 90 T dwarfs discovered by UKIDSS
	so far. It offers opportunities for future study via high-resolution
	near-infrared spectroscopy and spectroscopy in the thermal infrared.},
