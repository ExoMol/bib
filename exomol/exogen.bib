Abstract = {We compare the structures of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra
   calculated using different line lists for TiO and water vapor. We
   discuss the effects of different line list combinations on the model
   structures and spectra for both dwarf and giant stars. It is shown that
   recent improvements result in significantly improved spectra, in
   particular, in the optical where TiO bands are important. The water
   vapor-dominated near-infrared region remains problematic as the current
   water line lists do not yet completely reproduce the shapes of the
   observed spectra. We find that the AMES TiO list provides more opacity
   in most bands and that the new, smaller oscillator strengths lead to
   systematically cooler temperatures for early-type M dwarfs than previous
   models. These effects combine and will help to significantly improve the
   fits of models to observations in the optical as well as result in
   improved synthetic photometry of M stars. We show that the Davis,
   Littleton, \& Phillips f(el)-values for the delta and phi bands of TiO
   best reproduce the observed V-l color indices.}}

Abstract = {The family of correlation consistent polarized valence basis sets
   (cc-pVXZ) has been extended to include sextuple zeta sets (cc-pV6Z) for

   calculated with these sets for the electronic ground states of N-2 and
   HF using a number of correlated wave functions: MP2, MP3, MP4, CCSD,
   CCSD(T) and CAS+1+2. Spectroscopic constants have been calculated for
   each level of theory and have been compared with experiment. Combining
   these results with those of prior studies, complete basis set limits
   have been estimated for E(e), D-e and r(e). It is found that the
   cc-pV6Z basis sets yield dissociation energies that are within 0.6-0.8
   kcal mol(-1) (N-2) and 0.1 kcal mol(-1) (HF) of the estimated CBS
   limits. Adding core-core and core-valence contributions to the CCSD(T)

Abstract = {This article reviews new methods for computing vibrational energy
   levels of small polyatomic molecules. The principal impediment to the
   calculation of energy levels is the size of the required basis set. If
   one uses a product basis the Hamiltonian matrix for a four-atom
   molecule is too large to store in core memory. We discuss iterative
   methods that enable one to use a product basis to compute energy levels
   (and spectra) without storing a Hamiltonian matrix. Despite the
   advantages of iterative methods it is not possible, using product basis
   functions, to calculate vibrational spectra of molecules with more than
   four atoms. A very recent method combining contracted basis functions
   and the Lanczos algorithm with which vibrational energy levels of
   methane have been computed is described. New ideas, based on exploiting
   preconditioning, for reducing the number of matrix-vector products
   required to converge energy levels of interest are also summarized.}}

page = {084102},
Abstract = {An effective and general algorithm is suggested for variational
   vibrational calculations of N-atomic molecules using orthogonal,
   rectilinear internal coordinates. The protocol has three essential
   parts. First, it advocates the use of the Eckart-Watson Hamiltonians of
   nonlinear or linear reference configuration. Second, with the help of
   an exact expression of curvilinear internal coordinates (e.g., valence
   coordinates) in terms of orthogonal, rectilinear internal coordinates
   (e.g., normal coordinates), any high-accuracy potential or force field
   expressed in curvilinear internal coordinates can be used in the
   calculations. Third, the matrix representation of the appropriate
   Eckart-Watson Hamiltonian is constructed in a discrete variable
   representation, in which the matrix of the potential energy operator is
   always diagonal, whatever complicated form the potential function
   assumes, and the matrix of the kinetic energy operator is a sparse
   matrix of special structure. Details of the suggested algorithm as well
   as results obtained for linear and nonlinear test cases including H2O,
   H-3(+), CO2, HCN/HNC, and CH4 are presented.}

   functions. The discrete variable representation is used and the
   eigenvalue problem is solved using a Lanczos recursion combined with
   projection operator techniques in order to extract totally symmetric
   states. Lennard-Jones systems corresponding to Argon and Neon are
   studied in order to assess the accuracy of the method by comparing them
   with those of recent benchmark calculations. The approach allows the
   accurate calculation of several bound states. Calculations are also

Journal = {Ann. Rev. Phys. Chem.},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {59},
Pages = {741-769},
Abstract = {We review the high-resolution spectroscopic approach toward the study
   of intramolecular dynamics, emphasizing molecular parity violation.
   Theoretical work in the past decade has shown that parity-violating
   potentials in chiral molecules are much larger (typically one to two
   orders of magnitude) than anticipated on the basis of older theories.
   This makes experimental approaches toward small molecular
   parity-violating effects promising. The concepts and results of
   intramolecular dynamics derived from spectroscopy are analyzed as a
   sequence of symmetry breakings. We summarize the concepts of symmetry
   breakings (de facto and de lege) in view of parity violation in chiral
   molecules. The experimental schemes and the current status of
   spectroscopic experiments on molecular parity violation are
   established. We discuss the promises of detecting and accurately
   measuring parity-violating energy differences Delta E-pv on the order
   of 10(-11) J mol(-1) (approximately 100 aeV) in enantiomers of chiral
   molecules with regard to their contribution to fundamental physics in

Pages = {1253-1285},
Abstract = {A description is given of highly excited rotational and/or vibrational
   states of molecules in terms of localized vibrations or local modes. It
   is a didactic paper, making an attempt to unify the ideas and notations
   of the key publications on the subject in a manner that treats the
   vibrational and rotational motions equally and that demonstrates the
   importance of molecular symmetry. Emphasis is put on explaining the
   intimate relationship between local mode vibrations and the formation
   of both vibrational and rovibrational energy level clusters. In
   rovibrational cluster states, a molecule can sustain localized
   vibrations for very many vibrational periods, even with low vibrational
   excitation. Local mode behaviour is induced by both vibrational and
   rotational excitation. An important application of local mode theory is
   the derivation of relations between the effective rotation-vibration
   parameters for highly excited vibrational states of a molecule. It is
   shown here, using the (H2Se)-Se-80 molecule as example, that such
   relations are valid only for certain forms of the effective
   rotation-vibration Hamiltonian. Thus caution is required when the
   results of fittings to spectral data are compared with local mode

   from sodium in the planetary atmosphere, as recently predicted from
   several theoretical modeling efforts. Our model for a cloudless
   planetary atmosphere with a solar abundance of sodium in atomic form
   predicts more sodium absorption than we observe. There are several
   possibilities that may account for this reduced amplitude, including
   reaction of atomic sodium into molecular gases and/or condensates,
   photoionization of sodium by the stellar flux, a low primordial
   abundance of sodium, and the presence of clouds high in the atmosphere.}}

   observations of the dayside emission spectrum for HD189733b between
   2.0-2.4 mu m and 3.1-4.1 mu m, where we find a bright emission feature.
   Where overlap with space-based instruments exists, our results are in
   excellent agreement with previous measurements(2,6). A feature at
   similar to 3.25 mu m is unexpected and difficult to explain with models
   that assume local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions at the 1
   bar to 1 x 10(-6) bar pressures typically sampled by infrared
   measurements. The most likely explanation for this feature is that it
   arises fromnon-LTE emission from CH4, similar to what is seen in the
   atmospheres of planets in our own Solar System(7-9). These results
   suggest that non-LTE effects may need to be considered when
   interpreting measurements of strongly irradiated exoplanets.}

Pages = {140-166},
Abstract = {We present a comprehensive description of the theory and practice of
   opacity calculations from the infrared to the ultraviolet needed to
   generate models of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant
   planets. Methods for using existing line lists and spectroscopic
   databases in disparate formats are presented, and plots of the
   resulting absorptive opacities versus wavelength for the most important
   molecules and atoms at representative temperature/pressure points are
   provided. Electronic, rovibrational, bound-free, bound-bound,
   free-free, and collision-induced transitions and monochromatic
   opacities are derived, discussed, and analyzed. The species addressed
   include the alkali metals, iron, heavy metal oxides, metal hydrides,
   H-2, H2O, CH4, CO, NH3, H2S, PH3, and representative grains. Once
   monochromatic absorption cross sections for all constituents have been
   derived, chemical abundances have to be obtained before the resulting
   product can be summed to obtain total opacities. Hence, we include a
   review of the thermochemistry, techniques, and databases needed to
   derive equilibrium abundances and provide some sample results.}}

Title = {The presence of methane in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {452},
Pages = {329-331},
Abstract = {Molecules present in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets are expected
   to influence strongly the balance of atmospheric radiation, to trace
   dynamical and chemical processes, and to indicate the presence of
   disequilibrium effects. As molecules have the potential to reveal
   atmospheric conditions and chemistry, searching for them is a high
   priority. The rotational - vibrational transition bands of water,
   carbon monoxide and methane are anticipated to be the primary sources
   of non- continuum opacity in hot- Jupiter planets(1-3). As these bands
   can overlap in wavelength, and the corresponding signatures from them
   are weak, decisive identification requires precision infrared
   spectroscopy. Here we report a near- infrared transmission spectrum of
   the planet HD 189733b that shows the presence of methane. Additionally,
   a resolved water vapour band at 1.9 mu m confirms the recent claim(4)
   of water in this object. On thermochemical grounds, carbon monoxide is
   expected to be abundant in the upper atmosphere of hot- Jupiter
   planets, but is not identifiable here; therefore the detection of
   methane rather than carbon monoxide in such a hot planet(5,6) could
   signal the presence of a horizontal chemical gradient away from the
   permanent dayside, or it may imply an ill- understood photochemical
   mechanism that leads to an enhancement of methane.}}

Abstract = {We have performed a detailed ab initio computation of the dipole moment
   surface, the vibrational transition moments, and the spectral lines for
   the water molecule. A total of 412 vibrational eigenstates were
   identified below 30 000 cm(-1), corresponding to approximate to 85 000
   vibrational transitions. In principle there are many billions of
   allowed vibration-rotation transitions between these eigenstates. In
   our most complete test calculations we constructed a list of 3 billion
   (3 x 10(9)) lines. At room temperature, the computed monochromatic
   absorption coefficient is in good overall agreement with the HITRAN
   data base, while at higher temperatures its value exceeds the
   HITRAN-based absorption coefficient by more than an order of magnitude,
   due to the lack of high excitation lines in HITRAN. The agreement with
   the HITEMP version of HITRAN is considerably better than with the
   standard HITRAN. By comparing stellar model atmospheric structures and
   synthetic spectra based on our most extensive line list with results
   from calculations excluding the huge number of ultra-weak lines, we
   conclude that when the lines are well chosen, a few times 10 million
   lines are more than sufficient for all astrophysical purposes. We
   therefore offer to the community a line list of 100 million lines,
   easily accessible by anonymous ftp. Finally, we have compared results
   of synthetic stellar spectra based on this line list with observed ISO
   spectra and have found good agreement. In particular in the 2-4 mum
   region around the strong fundamental bands, the agreement with
   observations is considerably better than that obtained with other
   available water line lists.}}

Abstract = {The nearby extrasolar planet GJ 436b-which has been labelled as a `hot
   Neptune'-reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front
   of and behind its parent star as seen from Earth. Respectively known as
   the primary transit and secondary eclipse, the former constrains the
   planet's radius and mass(1,2), and the latter constrains the planet's
   temperature(3,4) and, with measurements at multiple wavelengths, its
   atmospheric composition. Previous work(5) using transmission
   spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-mu m-water vapour band, leaving
   the planet's atmospheric composition poorly constrained. Here we report
   the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b
   at multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse. The
   best-fit compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a
   substantial methane (CH(4)) deficiency relative to thermochemical
   equilibrium models(6) for the predicted hydrogen-dominated
   atmosphere(7,8). Moreover, we report the presence of some H(2)O and
   traces of CO(2). Because CH(4) is expected to be the dominant
   carbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical
   mixing(9) and polymerization of methane(10) into substances such as
   ethylene may be required to explain the hot Neptune's small CH(4)-to-CO
   ratio, which is at least 10(5) times smaller than predicted(6).}}

   positional (wave-number, cm(-1)) uncertainty is less than or equal
   to0.005 cm(-1), while the 1sigma, statistical uncertainty in absorbance

   multiple (typically 9) path length-concentration burdens and fitting a
   weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
   include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12
   samples. Though these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption
   strengths, and vapor pressures, the data agree to within experimental

 These advantages greatly facilitate the practical implementation and application of the tomography technique.

  abstract={We present a CCD-based photometric survey covering 870 arcmin 2 in a young stellar cluster around the young multiple star ~ Orionis. Our survey-limiting R , I , and Z magnitudes are 23.2, 21.8, and 21.0, respectively, the completeness being about 2.2 mag brighter. From our color-magnitude diagrams, we have selected 49 faint objects ( I = 15-21 mag), which smoothly extrapolate the photometric sequence defined by more massive known members. Adopting the currently accepted age interval of 2-10 Myr for the Orion 1b association, in which ~ Orionis is located, and considering recent evolutionary models, our objects may span a mass range from 0.1 down to 0.02 M  [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} , well within the substellar regime. Follow-up low-resolution optical spectroscopy (635-920 nm) for eight of our candidates in the magnitude range I = 16-19.5 shows that they have spectral types M6-M8.5, consistent with what is expected for true members. Compared with their Pleiades counterparts of similar types, H~ emission is generally stronger, while Na I and K I absorption lines appear weaker, as expected for lower surface gravities and younger ages. In addition, TiO and in particular VO bands appear to be clearly enhanced in our candidate with the latest spectral type, S Ori 45 (M8.5, I = 19.5), compared to objects of similar types in older clusters and the field. We have estimated the mass of this candidate at only 0.020-0.040 M  [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sun.gif] {sun} ; hence, it is one of the least massive brown dwarfs yet discovered. We examine the potential role of deuterium as a tracer of both substellar nature and age in very young clusters. The luminosity and mass at which the burning/preservation of deuterium takes place is a sensitive function of age and can therefore provide a determination of the age of a cluster. The ~ Orionis cluster is an excellent site for determining this transition zone empirically; the most massive brown dwarfs identified are expected to have burned their deuterium content, while the lowest mass ones should have preserved it.}

   to improve earlier systematics of D({[}R]) for A-X and related (0, 0)
   bands. The data are plotted to determine trends and wherever possible a
   heuristic equation is used to smooth them. Isoelectronic, dimer,
   hydride, and halide molecules are considered. Isoelectronic series
   containing a total of 28 molecules are plotted on \textbackslash{}Z(1)
   -Z(2)\textbackslash{}, the absolute difference of the atomic numbers of
   the two atoms in the molecules. The data become rapidly larger as
   rare-gas molecules are approached, behaving in a qualitative way like
   the internuclear separation r(e). Dimers from periods R = 2 and 3 behave
   similarly to each other, which is evidence for periodicity in diatomic
   data. The ad hoc function D-0({[}R]) = 0.33 + 0.054cosh{[}1.5(C - 4.2)],
   where 1 less than or equal to C less than or equal to 6 or 7 is the
   group number of either atom, describes their behavior reasonably well (C
   = 1, 2, 13,... 16 or 17 in the IUPAC scheme). For unipositive dimers,
   D+({[}R]) = 0.25 + 0.016cosh{[}(1.5(C - 5)] tracks the behavior as well
   but with one outlier (C-2(+)). 16 neutral hydride and 11 unipositive
   hydride molecular data show clear periodicity when plotted versus Z(1) +
   Z(2). The hydride data have nearly linear behavior, with increasing
   slopes for R = 2-4, when plotted on a function suggested by the 1/Z
   dependence of atomic oscillator strengths, with one major exception
   (CaH). The function is F-0 = {[}1/(n(e1) + n(e2))] - 0.14, where n(ei)
   is the valence-electron count in atom i. The unipositive hydride data
   have close to linear behavior, with increasing slopes for R = 2 and 3,
   when plotted on the similar function F+ = {[}1/(n(e1) + n(e2))] - 0.10,
   also with one major exception (BeH+). Clearly evident trends for halide
   molecules allow making qualitative estimates for two unknown transition

Journal = AA,
Year = {2005},

Pages = {691-706},
Abstract = {The dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied
   using infrared L- band spectra of AGB stars ( both carbon- rich and
   oxygen- rich) and M- type supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic
   Clouds ( LMC and SMC) and in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
   The spectra cover SiO bands for oxygen- rich stars, and acetylene (
   C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon- rich AGB stars. The equivalent width
   of acetylene is found to be high even at low metallicity. The high C2H2
   abundance can be explained with a high carbon- to- oxygen ( C/ O) ratio
   for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast, the HCN equivalent
   width is low: fewer than half of the extra- galactic carbon stars show
   the 3.5 mu m HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN equivalent
   width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon elemental
   abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
   mass, and stars with high luminosity ( i. e. high initial mass) could
   have a high HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-
   galactic and Galactic carbon stars. One SMC post- AGB star, SMC- S2,
   shows the 3.3 mu m PAH band. This first detection of a PAH band from an
   SMC post- AGB star confirms PAHs can form in these low- metallicity
   stars. None of the oxygen- rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
   possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the
   equivalent widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30
   angstrom for LMC metallicity. Several possible explanations are
   discussed, mostly based on the effect of pulsation and circumstellar
   dust. The observations imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach
   mass- loss rates as high as their Galactic counterparts, because there
   are more carbon atoms available and more carbonaceous dust can be
   formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO suggests less dust and lower
   mass- loss rates in low- metallicity oxygen- rich stars. The effect on
   the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.}}

Title = {Effects of primordial chemistry on the cosmic microwave background},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {490},
Pages = {521-535},
Abstract = {Context. Previous works have demonstrated that the generation of
   secondary CMB anisotropies due to the molecular optical depth is likely
   too small to be observed. In this paper, we examine additional ways in
   which primordial chemistry and the dark ages might influence the CMB.
   Aims. We seek a detailed understanding of the formation of molecules in
   the postrecombination universe and their interactions with the CMB. We
   present a detailed and updated chemical network and an overview of the
   interactions of molecules with the CMB.
   Methods. We calculate the evolution of primordial chemistry in a
   homogeneous universe and determine the optical depth due to line
   absorption, photoionization and photodissociation, and estimate the
   resulting changes in the CMB temperature and its power spectrum.
   Corrections for stimulated and spontaneous emission are taken into
   account.
   Results. The most promising results are obtained for the negative
   hydrogen ion H(-) and the HeH(+) molecule. The free-free process of H(-)
   yields a relative change in the CMB temperature of up to 2 x 10(-11),
   and leads to a frequency-dependent change in the power spectrum of the
   order 10(-7) at 30 GHz. With a change of the order 10(-10) in the power
   spectrum, our result for the bound-free process of H(-) is significantly
   below a previous suggestion. HeH(+) efficiently scatters CMB photons and
   smears out primordial fluctuations, leading to a change in the power
   spectrum of the order 10(-8).
   Conclusions. We demonstrate that primordial chemistry does not alter the
   CMB during the dark ages of the universe at the significance level of
   current CMB experiments. We determine and quantify the essential effects
   that may contribute to changes in the CMB and leave an imprint from the
   dark ages, thus constituting a potential probe of the early universe.}}

Abstract = {Ethylene (ethene, H(2)C=CH(2)) is a naturally occurring compound in
   ambient air that affects atmospheric chemistry and global climate. The
   C(2)H(4) spectrum is available in databases only for the 1000 and 3000

   In this work, the ethylene absorption spectrum was measured in the
   6030-6250 cm(-1) range with the use of a high resolution Bruker IFS
   125HR Fourier-spectrometer and a two-channel opto-acoustic spectrometer
   with a diode laser. As a secondary standard of wavelengths, the methane
   absorption spectrum was used in both cases.
   A preliminary analysis was realized thanks to the tensorial formalism
   developed by the Dijon group that is implemented in the XTDS software
   package {[}39]. We considered the two combination bands v(5)+v(9) and
   v(5)+v(11) as an interacting dyad. Parameters for the v(9)/v(11) dyad
   were fitted simultaneously from a re-analysis of previously recorded
   supersonic expansion jet FTIR data, while parameters for the v(5)=1
   Raman level were taken from literature. More than 600 lines could be
   assigned in the 60306250 cm(-1) region (and also 682 in the 2950-3150
   cm(-1) region) and effective Hamiltonian parameters were fitted,
   including Coriolis interaction parameters. The dyad features are
   globally quite well reproduced, even if there are still problems at high

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},
Volume = {132},
Abstract = {Correlation consistent basis sets have been optimized for accurately
   describing core-core and core-valence correlation effects with
   explicitly correlated F12 methods. The new sets, denoted cc-pCVnZ-F12
   (n=D, T, Q) and aug-cc-pC(F12)VnZ (n=D, T, Q, 5), were developed by
   augmenting the cc-pVnZ-F12 and aug-cc-pVnZ families of basis sets with
   additional functions whose exponents were optimized based on the
   difference between all-electron and valence-electron correlation
   energies. The number of augmented functions added is fewer, in general,
   than in the standard cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ families of basis sets.
   Optimal values of the geminal Slater exponent for use with these basis
   sets in MP2-F12 calculations are presented and are also recommended for
   CCSD-F12b calculations. Auxiliary basis sets for use in the resolution
   of the identity approximation in explicitly correlated calculations have
   also been optimized and matched to the new cc-pCVnZ-F12 series of
   orbital basis sets. The cc-pCVnZ-F12 basis sets, along with the new
   auxiliary sets, were benchmarked in CCSD(T)-F12b calculations of
   spectroscopic properties on a series of homo- and heteronuclear first
   and second row diatomic molecules. Comparing the effects of correlating
   the outer core electrons in these molecules with those from conventional
   CCSD(T) at the complete basis set limit, which involved calculations
   with new cc-pCV6Z basis sets for the second row elements that were also
   developed in the course of this work, it is observed that the F12 values
   are reasonably well converged already at just the triple-zeta level.}}

abstract={Opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of ultracool dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. We report here on the detailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our group for this application. We also present tables of Rosseland and Planck mean opacities, which are of use in some studies of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs. For the tables presented here we have included the opacities of important atomic and molecular species, including the alkali elements, pressure-induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant opacity sources, but we neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each species how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of public databases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public databases, and our own numerical calculations. We combine these opacities with abundances computed from a chemical equilibrium model using recently revised solar abundances to compute mean opacities. The chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and is applicable to ultracool dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks. We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially increases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature at densities relevant to the atmospheres and interiors of giant planets and brown dwarfs. We provide our opacity tables for public use and discuss their limitations.}

Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {{We present the discovery of seven ultracool brown dwarfs identified with
   the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Near-infrared
   spectroscopy reveals deep absorption bands of H(2)O and CH(4) that
   indicate all seven of the brown dwarfs have spectral types later than
   UGPS J072227.51-054031.2, the latest-type T dwarf currently known. The
   spectrum of WISEP J182831.08+ 265037.8 is distinct in that the heights
   of the J- and H-band peaks are approximately equal in units of f lambda,
   so we identify it as the archetypal member of the Y spectral class. The
   spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorption on
   the blue wing of the H-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to NH(3).
   These spectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between
  the T dwarfs and the Y dwarfs. In order to produce a smooth
   near-infrared spectral sequence across the T/Y dwarf transition, we have
   reclassified UGPS 0722-05 as the T9 spectral standard and tentatively
   assign WISEP J173835.52+ 273258.9 as the Y0 spectral standard. In total,
   six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classified as Y dwarfs: four are
   classified as Y0, one is classified as Y0 (pec?), and WISEP J1828+ 2650
   is classified as > Y0. We have also compared the spectra to the model
   atmospheres of Marley and Saumon and infer that the brown dwarfs have
   effective temperatures ranging from 300 K to 500 K, making them the
   coldest spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs known to date.}}}

   WASP-12b, CoRoT-2b, XO-1b, AND HD 189733b}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{763}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by recent spectroscopic evidence for carbon-rich atmospheres
   on some transiting exoplanets, we investigate the influence of the C/O
   ratio on the chemistry, composition, and spectra of extrasolar giant
   planets both from a thermochemical equilibrium perspective and from
   consideration of disequilibrium processes like photochemistry and
   transport-induced quenching. We find that although CO is predicted to be
   a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters for all C/O ratios,
   other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much more abundant
   when C/O < 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly in abundance
   when C/O > 1. Other notable species like N-2 and NH3 that do not contain
   carbon or oxygen are relatively unaffected by the C/O ratio.
   Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance of CH4, NH3, HCN,
   and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare the results of our
   models with secondary-eclipse photometric data from the Spitzer Space
   Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium models with C/O similar
   to 1 are consistent with spectra of WASP-12b, XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b,
   confirming the possible carbon-rich nature of these planets; (2) spectra
   from HD 189733b are consistent with C/O less than or similar to 1, but
   as the assumed metallicity is increased above solar, the required C/O
   ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent too much H2O absorption; (3)
   species like HCN can have a significant influence on spectral behavior
   in the 3.6 and 8.0 mu m Spitzer channels, potentially providing even
   more opacity than CH4 when C/O > 1; and (4) the very high CO2 abundance
   inferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared observations cannot be
   explained through equilibrium or disequilibrium chemistry in a
   hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. We discuss possible formation mechanisms
   for carbon-rich hot Jupiters, including scenarios in which the accretion
   of CO-rich, H2O-poor gas dominates the atmospheric envelope, and
   scenarios in which the planets accrete carbon-rich solids while
   migrating through disk regions inward of the snow line. The C/O ratio
   and bulk atmospheric metallicity provide important clues regarding the
   formation and evolution of the giant planets.}},

Title = {{C/O RATIO AS A DIMENSION FOR CHARACTERIZING EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2012}},
pages = {36},
Volume = {{758}},
Abstract = {{Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres have
   typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental
   abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made
   to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation.
   However, recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions
   based on such classification schemes, and chemical compositions
   retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar abundances.
   The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization scheme with
   dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this work, we suggest
   the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important second dimension for
   characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In hot-hydrogen-dominated
   atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative
   concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant species. Between a
   C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by
   several orders of magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new
   hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become prominent for C/O >= 1,
   while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O >= 1
   can preclude a strong thermal inversion due to TiO and VO in a hot
   Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally underabundant for C/O
   >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification scheme for
   hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation (or
   temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four classes
   in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical, thermal,
   and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations, we
   characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters
   (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in the
   framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the data for
   several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich atmospheres,
   new observations are required to conclusively constrain their C/O ratios
   in the day side as well as the terminator regions of their atmospheres.
   We discuss how observations using existing and forthcoming facilities
   can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary atmospheres.}},

Abstract = {We obtained spectra in the wavelength range lambda = 995-1769 nm of all
   four known planets orbiting the star HR 8799. Using the suite of
   instrumentation known as Project 1640 on the Palomar 5 m Hale Telescope,
   we acquired data at two epochs. This allowed for multiple imaging
   detections of the companions and multiple extractions of low-resolution
   (R similar to 35) spectra. Data reduction employed two different methods
   of speckle suppression and spectrum extraction, both yielding results
   that agree. The spectra do not directly correspond to those of any known
   objects, although similarities with L and T dwarfs are present, as well
   as some characteristics similar to planets such as Saturn. We
   tentatively identify the presence of CH4 along with NH3 and/or C2H2, and
   possibly CO2 or HCN in varying amounts in each component of the system.
   Other studies suggested red colors for these faint companions, and our
   data confirm those observations. Cloudy models, based on previous
   photometric observations, may provide the best explanation for the new
   data presented here. Notable in our data is that these presumably
   co-eval objects of similar luminosity have significantly different
   spectra; the diversity of planets may be greater than previously
   thought. The techniques and methods employed in this paper represent a
   new capability to observe and rapidly characterize exoplanetary systems
   in a routine manner over a broad range of planet masses and separations.
   These are the first simultaneous spectroscopic observations of multiple
   planets in a planetary system other than our own.},

Volume = {546},
Abstract = {Context. The atmosphere of hot Jupiters can be probed by primary transit
   and secondary eclipse spectroscopy. Owing to the intense UV irradiation,
   mixing, and circulation, their chemical composition is maintained out of
   equilibrium and must be modeled with kinetic models.
   Aims. Our purpose is to release a chemical network and the associated
   rate coefficients, developed for the temperature and pressure range
   relevant to hot Jupiters atmospheres. Using this network, we study the
   vertical atmospheric composition of the two hot Jupiters (HD 209458b and
   HD 189733b) with a model that includes photolyses and vertical mixing,
   and we produce synthetic spectra.
   Methods. The chemical scheme has been derived from applied combustion
   models that were methodically validated over a range of temperatures and
   pressures typical of the atmospheric layers influencing the observations
   of hot Jupiters. We compared the predictions obtained from this scheme
   with equilibrium calculations, with different schemes available in the
   literature that contain N-bearing species, and with previously published
   photochemical models.
   Results. Compared to other chemical schemes that were not subjected to
   the same systematic validation, we find significant differences whenever
   nonequilibrium processes take place (photodissociations or vertical
   mixing). The deviations from the equilibrium, hence the sensitivity to
   the network, are larger for HD 189733b, since we assume a cooler
   atmosphere than for HD 209458b. We found that the abundances of NH3 and
   HCN can vary by two orders of magnitude depending on the network,
   demonstrating the importance of comprehensive experimental validation. A
   spectral feature of NH3 at 10.5 mu m is sensitive to these abundance
   variations and thus to the chemical scheme.
   Conclusions. Due to the influence of the kinetics, we recommend using a
   validated scheme to model the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. The
   network we release is robust for temperatures within 300-2500 K and
   pressures from 10 mbar up to a few hundred bars, for species made of C,
   H, O, and N. It is validated for species up to 2 carbon atoms and for
   the main nitrogen species (NH3, HCN, N-2, NOx). Although the influence
   of the kinetic scheme on the hot Jupiters spectra remains within the
   current observational error bars (with the exception of NH3), it will
   become more important for atmospheres that are cooler or subjected to
   higher UV fluxes, because they depart more from equilibrium.},

   Enceladus}},
Journal = PSS,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {73-79},
Abstract = {We consider six possible sources of CH4 and other lowmass (C-2-C-5)
   organics in the plume of Enceladus: three of these sources represent
   initial endowments of organics: cometary organics, Titan-like tholin,
   and the Fisher-Tropsch type reactions in the gases from which Enceladus
   formed. The other three sources represent processes inside Enceladus:
   water-rock reactions, microbiology, and thermogenesis. We report on new
   laboratory results for C-2 hydrocarbons released by thermogenesis of
   laboratory tholin and the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis. Thermal
   processing of Titan-like tholin produced ratios of CH4/C2H4 and CH4/C2H6
   of about two for temperatures up to 450 degrees C and about six for a
   temperature of 650 degrees C. The low pressure (similar to 1 atm)
   Fisher-Tropsch type experiments produced CH4/C2H4 of similar to 1.5,
   similar to previous results. C2H2 was not produced by either process.
   Tests of gas production by four strains of methanogens confirmed the
   absence of any detectable production of non-methane hydrocarbons.
   Cometary endowment, the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis, and Titan-like
   tholin incorporation could be primary inputs of organics and subsequent
   thermal processing of any of these all are possible sources of low mass
   organics in the plume. Biological production and water-rock reactions
   are an alternative source of CH4. Aqueous reactions with CO and H-2 can
   produce C-2-C-5 organics even at the low pressures of the interior of
   Enceladus. If there is a confirmed detection of CO and C2H2 in the plume
   of Enceladus, this provides an important constraint on sources, as we
   have identified no process, other than the initial volatile component of
   cometary organics, which can supply these gases. Precise determination
   of the relative concentrations of C-1-C-5 hydrocarbons may provide
   additional constraints on sources, but a detailed isotopic analysis of C
   and H in these organics and a search for amino acids constitute the next
   important steps in resolving the sources of the organics in Enceladus'
   plume. },

Abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional photochemical and thermochemical
   kinetics and diffusion model to study the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry on the atmospheric composition of ``hot-Jupiter{''}
   exoplanets. Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon,
   hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species on HD 189733b and HD 209458b and
   we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse
   observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular
   constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching
   and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b; however, the
   warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain
   thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are
   found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few
   bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and
   NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium
   chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons
   (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like
   OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N-2, and CO2 more closely follow
   their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures less than or similar to
   1 mu bar, where CO, H2O, and N-2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2
   is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced
   abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral
   signatures and thermal profiles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool,
   transiting exoplanets. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the
   assumed temperature structure and eddy diffusion coefficients and
   discuss further observational consequences of these models.},

Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope
   of six carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the
   Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) and two foreground
   Galactic carbon stars. The band strengths of the observed C(2)H(2) and
   SiC features are very similar to those observed in Galactic AGB stars.
   The metallicities are estimated from an empirical relation between the
   acetylene optical depth and the strength of the SiC feature. The
   metallicities are higher than those of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and
   close to Galactic values. While the high metallicity could imply an age
   of around 1 Gyr, for the dusty AGB stars, the pulsation periods suggest
   ages in excess of 2 or 3 Gyr. We fit the spectra of the observed stars
   using the DUSTY radiative transfer model and determine their dust
   mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0-3.3 x 10(-8) M(circle dot)

Abstract = {Methane and other larger hydrocarbons have been proposed as possible
   greenhouse gases on early Mars. In this work we explore if volcanic
   processes may have been a source for such molecules based on theoretical
   and experimental considerations. Geologic evidence and numerical
   simulations indicate that explosive volcanism was widely distributed
   throughout Mars. Volcanic lightning is typically produced in such
   explosive volcanism. Therefore this geologic setting was studied to
   determine if lightning could be a source for hydrocarbons in volcanic
   plumes. Volcanic lightning was simulated by focusing a high-energy
   infrared laser beam inside of a Pyrex reactor that contained the
   proposed volcanic gas mixture composed of 64\% CH4, 24\% H-2, 10\% H2O
   and 2\% N-2, according to an accretion model and the nitrogen content
   measured in Martian meteorites. The analysis of products was performed
   by gas chromatography coupled to infrared and mass spectroscopy. Eleven
   hydrocarbons were identified among the products, of which acetylene
   (C2H2) was the most abundant. A thermochemical model was used to
   determine which hydrocarbons could arise only from volcanic heat. In
   this case, acetylene and ethylene are formed at magmatic temperatures.
   Our results indicate that explosive volcanism may have injected into the
   atmosphere of early Mars similar to 6 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of acetylene,

Year = {2005},
Volume = {434},
Pages = {691-706},
Abstract = {The dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied
   using infrared L- band spectra of AGB stars ( both carbon- rich and
   oxygen- rich) and M- type supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic
   Clouds ( LMC and SMC) and in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
   The spectra cover SiO bands for oxygen- rich stars, and acetylene (
   C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon- rich AGB stars. The equivalent width
   of acetylene is found to be high even at low metallicity. The high C2H2
   abundance can be explained with a high carbon- to- oxygen ( C/ O) ratio
   for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast, the HCN equivalent
   width is low: fewer than half of the extra- galactic carbon stars show
   the 3.5 $\mu$m HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN equivalent
   width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon elemental
   abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
   mass, and stars with high luminosity ( i. e. high initial mass) could
   have a high HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-
   galactic and Galactic carbon stars. One SMC post- AGB star, SMC- S2,
   shows the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH band. This first detection of a PAH band from an
   SMC post- AGB star confirms PAHs can form in these low- metallicity
   stars. None of the oxygen- rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
   possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the
   equivalent widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30
   angstrom for LMC metallicity. Several possible explanations are
   discussed, mostly based on the effect of pulsation and circumstellar
   dust. The observations imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach
   mass- loss rates as high as their Galactic counterparts, because there
   are more carbon atoms available and more carbonaceous dust can be
   formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO suggests less dust and lower
   mass- loss rates in low- metallicity oxygen- rich stars. The effect on
   the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.},

   The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and ejected
   material creates a plume of surface materials in front of the spot.
   Molecular and atomic absorption occurs as the blackbody radiation passes
   through the ejected plume. Bulk molecular and atomic composition of the
   surface material is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the
   heated spot through the ejected plume. The proposed method is distinct
   from current stand-off approaches to composition analysis, such as
   Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), which atomizes and ionizes
   target material and observes emission spectra to determine bulk atomic
   composition. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with laser
   heating show great promise for Remote Laser-Evaporative Molecular
   Absorption (R-LEMA) spectroscopy. The method is well-suited for
   exploration of cold solar system targets-asteroids, comets, planets,
   moons-such as from a spacecraft orbiting the target. Spatial composition
   maps could be created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a
   single spot continuously produces a borehole or trench, and shallow
   sub-surface composition profiling is possible. This paper describes
   system concepts for implementing the proposed method to probe the bulk
   molecular composition of an asteroid from an orbiting spacecraft,
   including laser array, photovoltaic power, heating and ablation, plume
   characteristics, absorption, spectrometry and data management.}},

    abstract = {We present a Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopic survey of
    mass-losing carbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the Large Magellanic
    Cloud (LMC). The stars represent the superwind phase on the asymptotic giant
    branch (AGB), which forms a major source of dust for the interstellar medium
    (ISM) in galaxies. Bolometric magnitudes indicate progenitor masses of 1.5-2.5Msolar.
    The spectra cover the wavelength range 5-38µm. They show varying combinations
    of dust continuum, dust emission features (SiC, MgS) and molecular absorption
    bands (C2H2, HCN). A 10-µm absorption feature is attributed to C3. A weak band
    at 5.8µm is suggestive of carbonyl. The circumstellar 7.5-µm C2H2 band is found
    to be stronger at lower metallicity, explained by higher C/O ratios at low
    metallicity. The J - K versus K - A colours, used to select the sample, are
    shown to be relatively insensitive in separating carbon versus oxygen-rich
    AGB stars. The predominance of carbon stars therefore indicates that in the
    range 1.5-2.5Msolar, LMC AGB stars become carbon-rich before onset of the superwind.
    A set of four narrow bands, dubbed the Manchester system, is used to define
    the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. We investigate the strength
    and central wavelength of the SiC and MgS dust bands as a function of colour
    and metallicity. The line-to-continuum ratio of these bands shows some
    indication of being lower at low metallicity. The MgS band is only seen at
    dust temperatures below 600K. Metal-poor carbon stars can form amorphous
    carbon dust from self-produced carbon. The formation efficiency of oxygen-rich
    dust depends more strongly on metallicity. In lower-metallicity environments,
    the dust input into the ISM by AGB stars may be strongly biased towards
    carbonaceous dust. },

Surprisingly, the abundances of di- and triacetylene are only a factor of 2-4 lower than that of C 2 H 2 . Benzene is [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 40 times less abundant than acetylene. We suggest that the chemistry in CRL 618 has been strongly modified by the UV photons coming from the hot central star and by the shocks associated with its high-velocity winds. All the infrared bands arise from a region with kinetic temperatures between 200 and 250 K, probably the photodissociation region associated with the dense torus that surrounds the central star. C 4 H 2 and C 6 H 2 have also been detected in CRL 2688, so it seems that C-rich proto-planetary nebulae are the best organic chemistry factories in space.}

   formations as evidence for biological cycling of phosphate in the early
   biosphere}},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {115-125},
Abstract = {The banded iron formation deposited during the first 2 billion years of
   Earth's history holds the key to understanding the interplay between the
   geosphere and the early biosphere at large geological timescales. The
   earliest ore-scale phosphorite depositions formed almost at 2.02.2
   billion years ago bear evidence for the earliest bloom of aerobic life.
   The cycling of nutrient phosphorus and how it constrained primary
   productivity in the anaerobic world of ArcheanPalaeoproterozoic eons are
   still open questions. The controversy centers about whether the
   precipitation of ultrafine ferric oxyhydroxide due to the microbial
   Fe(II) oxidation in oceans earlier than 1.9 billion years substantially
   sequestrated phosphate, and whether this process significantly limited
   the primary productivity of the early biosphere. In this study, we
   report apatite radial flowers of a few micrometers in the 2728
   million-year-old Abitibi banded iron formation and the 2460
   million-year-old Kuruman banded iron formation and their similarities to
   those in the 535 million-year-old Lower Cambrian phosphorite. The
   lithology of the 535 Million-year-old phosphorite as a biosignature
   bears abundant biomarkers that reveal the possible similar
   biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in the Later Archean and
   Palaeoproterozoic oceans. These apatite radial flowers represent the
   primary precipitation of phosphate derived from the phytoplankton blooms
   in the euphotic zones of Neoarchean and Palaoeproterozoic oceans. The
   unbiased distributions of the apatite radial flowers within
   sub-millimeter bands do not support the idea of an Archean Crisis of
   Phosphate. This is the first report of the microbial mediated
   mineralization of phosphorus before the Great Oxidation Event when the
   whole biosphere was still dominated by anaerobic microorganisms.},

Title = {Synthetic photometry for carbon rich giants {I. Hydrostatic} dust-free models},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {503},
Pages = {913-928},
Abstract = {Context. Carbon rich objects represent an important phase during the
   late stages of evolution of low and intermediate mass stars. They
   contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment and to the infrared
   light of galaxies. A proper description of their atmospheres is crucial
   for the determination of fundamental parameters such as effective
   temperature or mass loss rate.
   Aims. We study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of carbon
   stars. In the first paper of this series we focus on objects that can be
   described by hydrostatic models neglecting dynamical phenomena like
   pulsation and mass loss. As a consequence, the reddening due to
   circumstellar dust is not included. Our results are collected in a
   database, which can be used in conjunction with stellar evolution and
   population synthesis calculations involving the AGB.
   Methods. We have computed a grid of 746 spherically symmetric COMARCS
   atmospheres covering effective temperatures between 2400 and 4000 K,
   surface gravities from log(g {[}cm/s(2)]) = 0.0 to -1.0, metallicities
   ranging from the solar value down to one tenth of it and C/O ratios in
   the interval between 1.05 and 5.0. Subsequently, we used these models to
   create synthetic low resolution spectra and photometric data for a large
   number of filter systems. The tables including the results are
   electronically available. First tests of the application on stellar
   evolution calculations are shown.
   Results. We have selected some of the most commonly used colours in
   order to discuss their behaviour as a function of the stellar
   parameters. A comparison with measured data shows that down to 2800 K
   the agreement between predictions and observations of carbon stars is
   good and our results may be used to determine quantities like the
   effective temperature. Below this limit the synthetic colours are much
   too blue. The obvious reason for these problems is the neglect of
   circumstellar reddening and structural changes due to pulsation and mass
   loss.
   Conclusions. The warmer carbon stars with weak pulsation can be
   successfully described by our hydrostatic models. In order to include
   also the cooler objects with intense variations, at least a proper
   treatment of the reddening caused by the dusty envelopes is needed. This
   will be the topic of the second paper of this series.},

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{473}},
Pages = {5158-5185},
Abstract = {{We present a grid of forward model transmission spectra, adopting an
   isothermal temperature-pressure profile, alongside corresponding
   equilibrium chemical abundances for 117 observationally significant hot
   exoplanets (equilibrium temperatures of 547-2710 K). This model grid has
   been developed using a 1D radiative-convective-chemical equilibrium
   model termed ATMO, with up-to-date high-temperature opacities. We
   present an interpretation of observations of 10 exoplanets, including
   best-fitting parameters and chi(2) maps. In agreement with previous
   works, we find a continuum from clear to hazy/cloudy atmospheres for
   this sample of hot Jupiters. The data for all the 10 planets are
   consistent with subsolar to solar C/O ratio, 0.005 to 10 times solar
   metallicity and water rather than methane-dominated infrared spectra. We
   then explore the range of simulated atmospheric spectra for different
   exoplanets, based on characteristics such as temperature, metallicity,
   C/O ratio, haziness and cloudiness. We find a transition value for the
   metallicity between 10 and 50 times solar, which leads to substantial
   changes in the transmission spectra. We also find a transition value of
   C/O ratio, from water to carbon species dominated infrared spectra, as
   found by previous works, revealing a temperature dependence of this
   transition point ranging from similar to 0.56 to similar to 1-1.3 for
   equilibrium temperatures from similar to 900 to similar to 2600 K. We
   highlight the potential of the spectral features of HCN and C2H2 to
   constrain the metallicities and C/O ratios of planets, using James Webb
   Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Finally, our entire grid (similar
   to 460 000 simulations) is publicly available and can be used directly
   with the JWST simulator PandExo for planning observations.}},

  journal=ApJL,
  volume={804},
  pages={L17},
  year={2015},
  abstract={This work aims to improve the current understanding of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, especially cold ones with spectral types T and Y, whose modeling is a current challenge. Silicate and iron clouds are believed to disappear at the photosphere at the L/T transition, but cloudless models fail to reproduce correctly the spectra of T dwarfs, advocating for the addition of more physics, e.g., other types of clouds or internal energy transport mechanisms. We use a one-dimensional radiative/convective equilibrium code ATMO to investigate this issue. This code includes both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium chemistry and solves consistently the PT structure. Included opacity sources are H 2 -H 2 , H 2 -He, H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , CH 4 , NH 3 , K, Na, and TiO, VO if they are present in the atmosphere. We show that the spectra of Y dwarfs can be accurately reproduced with a cloudless model if vertical mixing and NH 3 quenching are taken into account. T dwarf spectra still have some reddening in, e.g., J – H , compared to cloudless models. This reddening can be reproduced by slightly reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. We propose that this reduction of the stabilizing temperature gradient in these layers, leading to cooler structures, is due to the onset of fingering convection, triggered by the destabilizing impact of condensation of very thin dust.}

	abstract = {Chemical kinetics plays an important role in controlling the atmospheric composition of all planetary atmospheres, including those of extrasolar planets. For the hottest exoplanets, the composition can closely follow thermochemical-equilibrium predictions, at least in the visible and infrared photosphere at dayside (eclipse) conditions. However, for atmospheric temperatures , and in the uppermost atmosphere at any temperature, chemical kinetics matters. The two key mechanisms by which kinetic processes drive an exoplanet atmosphere out of equilibrium are photochemistry and transport-induced quenching. I review these disequilibrium processes in detail, discuss observational consequences and examine some of the current evidence for kinetic processes on extrasolar planets.},
