Strong spectral signatures were observed above the noise baseline for each test gas at all densities considered. Unique molecular signatures were observed for both CH    4 and CO    2 along with atomic features for each gas. The LIBS intensity response with respect to density was determined for each species using Voigt lineshape fitting or numerical integration. Finally, the collection and analysis of LIBS spectra of composite mixtures of CH    4–CO    2 and CH    4–H    2 demonstrates that the extraction of individual densities from gas mixtures is feasible at low densities.},

Title = {{Modelling the effect of volcanic outgassing of sulphur on early Martian
   surface temperatures using a 3-D Global Climate Model}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {436},
Abstract = {Around the time of the transition from the Late Noachian to the Early
   Hesperian eras (similar to 3.6 Gya), Mars was predicted to have been
   both volcanically active, and have sustained a climate warm enough to
   melt liquid water on its surface episodically despite a faint young sun.
   The effect of volcanic outgassing on the climate of early Mars and its
   ability to raise temperatures above the melting point of water has,
   however, been disputed, with a major uncertainty being the timescales
   over which the greenhouse effect of outgassed sulphur dioxide (SO2) and
   hydrogen sulphide (H2S) can warm the atmosphere of Mars before they
   react to form H2SO4 and S8 aerosols which act to cool the surface of
   Mars. We have developed the first 3-D model of the Martian sulphur cycle
   from source to sink that includes outgassing of SO2, H2S and S2 from the
   surface, the formation of H2SO4 and S8 through atmospheric chemistry,
   and the condensation and deposition of H2SO4 and S8 to the surface. We
   simulate the effect of a single large, day-long volcanic outgassing
   event on global surface temperatures, identifying the magnitude and
   duration of any net warming and cooling as a function of outgassing
   magnitude, atmospheric pressure, obliquity and aerosol particle size
   distribution. We confirm the results of Tian et al. (2010, EPSL 295,
   412-418) and find that the persistence of the warming effect of
   volcanically outgassed SO2 and H2S on the Martian atmosphere is only of
   the order of days to weeks for a surface pressure range of between 0.5
   and 1.5 bars. Typical outgassing magnitudes result in a net cooling of
   the Martian surface over timescales of 3-4 years near the equator and
   several decades at the poles for plume neutral buoyancy heights within
   the troposphere. For very high magnitudes of outgassing, the rate of
   H2SO4 cloud formation slows down due to the depletion of water vapour in
   the atmosphere, thereby slowing down the rate of cooling and providing a
   buffer against atmospheric collapse.},

journal = JPD,
abstract = {Luminescence spectroscopy was used to examine the dynamics of propellant dissociation near the emitter tip of a single-emitter porous electrospray thruster loaded with the ionic liquid EMI-BF4. Luminescence spectra from CH, C2, CN, NH, BH, Hα, and Hβ were observed and confirmed by comparison with simulated spectra. Analysis of the CH (A 2Δ, v′ = 0) spectra yielded a rotational temperature 3082 ± 30 K while the C2 (d 3Πg− a 3Πu) Swan system yielded rotational temperatures 6252 ± 92 K and 5914 ± 75 K for Δv = 0 and Δv = +1, respectively. Examination of the integrated spectral signals from acquired CH (A 2Δ), BH (A 1Π), and Hα spectra showed a strong correlation with measured extractor current in both positive and negative polarity mode. The evidence suggests the formation of these electronically excited species is due to dissociative excitation induced by high-energy collisions between emitted ions and propellant accumulated on the extractor orifice. A weak broadband signal was also observed and is likely due to dissociative excitation of the anion, BF4−, leading to the formation of electronically excited BF2. Analysis of the neutral gas within the test chamber with a mass spectrometer confirmed the presence of BF2, providing strong evidence the observed broadband signal is the result of BF2.}

abstract={One of the demanding frontiers in ultracold quantum science is identifying laser cooling schemes for complex atoms and molecules out of their vast spectra of internal states. Motivated by the prospect of expanding the set of available ultracold molecules for applications in fundamental physics, chemistry, astrochemistry, and quantum simulation, we propose and demonstrate an automated graph-based search approach for viable laser cooling schemes. The method is time efficient, reproduces the results of previous manual searches, and reveals a plethora of new potential laser cooling schemes. We discover laser cooling schemes for YO, C2, OH+, CN, and CO2, including surprising schemes that start from highly excited states or do not rely on a strong main transition. A central insight of this work is that the reinterpretation of quantum states and transitions between them as a graph can dramatically enhance the ability to identify new quantum control schemes for complex quantum systems. As such, this approach will also apply to complex atoms and, in fact, any complex many-body quantum system with a discrete spectrum of internal states.},

Abstract = {In this work, the performance of transition metal-doped gallium nitride
   nanosheets (M-GaNNSs, M = Cr, Fe, Ni and Zn) for adsorption and sensing
   of HCN, HNC and CH3CN toxic gases were investigated at the
   Grimme-corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof/double numerical plus
   polarization (PBE/DNP) level of theory. The electronic properties,
   structural parameters, adsorption energies, density of states (DOS)
   curves, band gap energies and charge transfer values were analyzed to
   find the ability of eight metal-doped GaNNS in adsorbing and sensing
   HCN, HNC and CH3CN gases. Compared with pure GaNNS, in all eight
   metal-doped configurations, the adsorption energies were increased after
   the doping of metals, especially their value in 2-HCN-FeNGaNNS,
   2-HNC-FeNGaNNS and 2-CH3CN-FeNGaNNS were greater than in others.
   Therefore, the FeNGaNNS may be a suitable candidate for adsorbing and
   removing all the three studied gases from the atmosphere. Upon
   adsorption of HCN, HNC and CH3CN gases on the metal-doped GaNNS, a
   significant change in the energy gap is found in 2-HCN-CrNGaNNS,
   1-HNC-FeGaGaNNS and 2-CH3CN-CrNGaNNS complexes, and, in turn, in the
   conductivity of nanostructures. Therefore, it is predicted that,
   CrNGaNNS for sensing HCN and CH3CN gases and FeGaGaNNS for sensing HNC
   gas have a high potential. Although, FeGaGaNNS could be a good sensor
   for HCN and CH3CN gases in the second step and after CrNGaNNS.},

Journal =AJ,
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {We describe several updates to Korg, a package for 1D LTE spectral
   synthesis of FGKM stars. Built-in functions to fit observed spectra via
   synthesis or equivalent widths make it easy to take advantage of Korg's
   automatic differentiation. Comparison to a past analysis of 18 Sco shows
   that we obtain significantly reduced line-to-line abundance scatter with
   Korg. Fitting and synthesis are facilitated by a rigorously tested model
   atmosphere interpolation method, which introduces negligible error to
   synthesized spectra for stars with T eff greater than or similar to 4000
   K. For cooler stars, atmosphere interpolation is complicated by the
   presence of molecules, though we demonstrate an adequate method for cool
   dwarfs. The chemical equilibrium solver has been extended to include
   polyatomic and charged molecules, extending Korg's regime of
   applicability to M stars. We also discuss a common oversight regarding
   the synthesis of hydrogen lines in the infrared, and show that Korg's
   Brackett line profiles are a much closer match to observations than
   others available. Documentation, installation instructions, and

   Early Earth},
Journal = {Planet. Sci. J.},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {The origin of life on Earth would benefit from a prebiotic atmosphere
   that produced nitriles, like HCN, which enable ribonucleotide synthesis.
   However, geochemical evidence suggests that Hadean air was relatively
   oxidizing with negligible photochemical production of prebiotic
   molecules. These paradoxes are resolved by iron-rich asteroid impacts
   that transiently reduced the entire atmosphere, allowing nitriles to
   form in subsequent photochemistry. Here we investigate impact-generated
   reducing atmospheres using new time-dependent, coupled atmospheric
   chemistry and climate models that account for gas-phase reactions and
   surface catalysis. The resulting H-2-, CH4-, and NH3-rich atmospheres
   persist for millions of years, until the hydrogen escapes to space. The
   HCN and HCCCN production and rainout to the surface can reach 109
   molecules cm(-2) s(-1) in hazy atmospheres with a mole ratio of CH4/CO2
   > 0.1. Smaller CH4/CO2 ratios produce HCN rainout rates of <10(5)
   molecules cm(-2) s(-1) and negligible HCCCN. The minimum impactor mass
   that creates atmospheric CH4/CO2 > 0.1 is 4 x 10(20)-5 x 10(21) kg
   (570-1330 km diameter), depending on how efficiently iron reacts with a
   steam atmosphere, the extent of atmospheric equilibration with an
   impact-induced melt pond, and the surface area of nickel that catalyzes
   CH4 production. Alternatively, if steam permeates and deeply oxidizes
   the crust, impactors of similar to 1020 kg could be effective.
   Atmospheres with copious nitriles have >360 K surface temperatures,
   perhaps posing a challenge for RNA longevity, although cloud albedo can
   produce cooler climates. Regardless, postimpact cyanide can be
   stockpiled and used in prebiotic schemes after hydrogen has escaped to
   space.},

Title = {{Spatially resolved broadband absorption spectroscopy measurements of
   temperature and multiple species (NH, OH, NO, and NH3) in
   atmospheric-pressure premixed ammonia/methane/air flames}},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Abstract = {The temperature and multi-species concentration distributions, including
   NH, OH, NO, and NH3, are of great importance to the research on
   ammonia/methane combustion mechanisms. However, there is scarce research
   simultaneously measuring these parameters in atmospheric-pressure
   ammonia/methane flames. In this work, we proposed a measurement method
   based on the ultraviolet broadband absorption spectroscopy (BAS) to
   realize the simultaneous measurement of temperature and multiple species
   concentrations for the first time (absolute concentrations for OH, NH,
   and NO, and relative concentrations for NH3). Due to the strong
   absorption of the electronic transitions in the ultraviolet range, the
   proposed method offers low detection limits for concentration
   measurements. Taking NH radicals as an example, the detection limit is
   as low as 31 ppb at 1700 K. High sensitivity for temperature
   measurements is also achieved due to the multi-line spectra of OH
   broadband absorption. Moreover, a fitting strategy was proposed to
   separate the NO and NH3 spectra near 225 nm, enabling a simultaneous
   determination of both species. We established an optical system based on
   the proposed BAS method with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.1
   mm to perform spatially resolved measurements of temperature and
   multiple species on atmospheric ammonia/methane/air flames. The
   ammonia/methane flames were investigated at different equivalence ratios
   (0.9, 1.0, and 1.1) and different ammonia mole fractions in fuels (10\%,
   30\%, and 50\%). As investigated, NH and NH3 concentrations increased
   linearly with increasing ammonia mole fractions, while OH and NO
   concentrations decreased in similar trends with increasing equivalence
   ratios. The experimentally measured temperature and multi-species
   concentrations were compared with computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations using the mechanism of the CRECK modeling group. Good
   agreements were achieved in absolute values, spatial profiles, and
   variations with equivalence ratios and ammonia mole fractions.},

These data represent the first spectral line survey of NML Cyg and are complementary to a previous 1 mm survey of the envelope of a similar hypergiant, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa). The complete NML Cyg data set is presented here. In the survey, 104 emission lines were observed, arising from 17 different molecules and 4 unidentified features. Many of the observed features have complex line profiles, arising from asymmetric outflows characteristic of hypergiant stars. While most of the lines in the survey arise from SiO, SO, SO2, and SiS, CO had the strongest emission. Five other C-bearing species are identified in the survey (HCN, CN, HCO+, CS, and HNC), demonstrating an active carbon chemistry despite the O-rich environment. Moreover, NS was observed, but not NO, although favorable transitions of both molecules lie in the surveyed region. Sulfur chemistry appears to be prominent in NML Cyg and plays an important role in the collimated outflows. The refractory species observed, NaCl and AlO, have narrow emission lines, indicating that these molecules do not reach the terminal expansion velocity. NaCl and AlO likely condense into dust grains at r &lt; 50 R *. From NaCl, the chlorine isotope ratio was determined to be 35Cl/37Cl = 3.85 ± 0.30.}

pages={A113},
Abstract = {{Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the fourth, sixth, and third most
   abundant elements in the Sun. Their abundances remain hotly debated due
   to the so-called solar modelling problem that has persisted for almost
   20 years. We revisit this issue by presenting a homogeneous analysis of
   408 molecular lines across 12 diagnostic groups, observed in the solar
   intensity spectrum. Using a realistic 3D radiative-hydrodynamic model
   solar photosphere and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) line
   formation, we find log C-C = 8:47 +/- 0:02, log epsilon(N) = 7:89 +/-
   0:04, and log epsilon(O)= 8:70 +/- 0:04. The stipulated uncertainties
   mainly reflect the sensitivity of the results to the model atmosphere;
   this sensitivity is correlated between the different diagnostic groups,
   which all agree with the mean result to within 0:03 dex. For carbon and
   oxygen, the molecular results are in excellent agreement with our 3D
   non-LTE analyses of atomic lines. For nitrogen, however, the molecular
   indicators give a 0:12 dex larger abundance than the atomic indicators,
   and our best estimate of the solar nitrogen abundance is given by the
   mean: 7:83 dex. The solar oxygen abundance advocated here is close to
   our earlier determination of 8:69 dex, and so the present results do not
   significantly alleviate the solar modelling problem.}},

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{654}},
Abstract = {{Context. The Gaia mission is a magnitude-limited whole-sky survey that
   collects an impressive quantity of astrometric, spectro-photometric and
   spectroscopic data. Among all the on-board instruments, the Radial
   Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) produces millions of spectra up to a
   magnitude of G(RVS) similar to 16. For the brightest RVS targets,
   stellar atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances are
   automatically estimated by the Generalized Stellar Parametriser -
   spectroscopy group (GSP-Spec). These data will be published with the
   third Gaia Data Release.
   Aims. Some major ingredients of the determination of these stellar
   parameters include the atomic and molecular line lists that are adopted
   to compute reference synthetic spectra, on which the parametrisation
   methods rely. We aim to build such a specific line list optimised for
   the analysis of RVS late-type star spectra.
   Methods. Starting from the Gaia-ESO line lists, we first compared the
   observed and synthetic spectra of six well-known reference late-type
   stars in the wavelength range covered by the RVS instrument. We then
   improved the quality of the atomic data for the transitions presenting
   the largest mismatches.
   Results. The new line list is found to produce very high-quality
   synthetic spectra for the tested reference stars and has thus been
   adopted within GSP-Spec. We note, however, that a couple of atomic line
   profiles, in particular the calcium infrared triplet lines, still show
   some deviations compared to the reference spectra, probably because of
   the adopted line-transfer assumptions (local thermodynamical
   equilibrium, hydrostatic, and no chromosphere). Future works should
   focus on such lines and should extend the present work towards OBA and
   M-type stellar spectra.}},

   NaCl and AlO. The 1 mm spectrum of NML Cyg closely resembles that of VY
   Canis Majoris (VY CMa) suggesting that the chemistries of hypergiant
   stars are similar. The line profiles in NML Cyg consist of multiple
   velocity features, particularly evident in SO2 and SO. In addition to a
   spherical wind at the star's systemic velocity, the spectra suggest an
   asymmetric, blueshifted component near V (LSR) = -21 +/- 3 km s(-1) and
   a collimated, redshifted component near 15 +/- 3 km s(-1), positioned
   similar to 34 degrees and similar to 12 degrees, respectively, from the
   line of sight. The red- and blueshifted flows appear to be randomly
   oriented, and likely trace sporadic mass loss events. Their LSR
   velocities align closely with those of 22 GHz water masers, suggesting
   an NE-SE orientation. The winds may also be associated with the
   asymmetric nebula in F555W HST images but extending to 5 `' (similar to
   600R ({*})). NML Cyg appears to be another example of rare, massive

A blackbody signal is emitted by the heated spot, traveling outward through the evaporated material; reflective optics direct the signal into a spectrometer. Ro-vibrational absorption in the plume provides a diagnostic for identifying bulk molecular composition of the substrate. Absorption spectra are modeled for compounds with available a priori molecular cross-sections, based on laser and receiver characteristics, and target material properties. Mass ejection flux drives the plume density profile. Qualitative, species-specific spectral profiles are derived by integrating molecular cross section along a path through the plume.

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {142},
pages = {214305},
Abstract = {A new experimental setup coupling a High Enthalpy Source (HES) reaching
   2000 K to a cw-cavity ring-down spectrometer has been developed to
   investigate rotationally cold hot bands of polyatomic molecules in the
   {[}1.5,1.7] mu m region. The rotational and vibrational molecular
   degrees of freedom are strongly decoupled in the hypersonic expansion
   produced by the HES and probed by cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Carbon
   monoxide has been used as a first test molecule to validate the
   experimental approach. Its expansion in argon led to rotational and
   vibrational temperatures of 6.7 +/- 0.8 K and 2006 +/- 476 K,
   respectively. The tetradecad polyad of methane (1.67 mu m) was
   investigated under similar conditions leading to rotational and
   vibrational temperatures of 13 +/- 5 K and 750 +/- 100 K, respectively.
   The rotationally cold structure of the spectra reveals many hot bands
   involving highly excited vibrational states of methane.},

Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Tech.},
Year = {2015},
volume = {8},
Pages = {4329-4346},
Abstract = {In recent updates of the HITRAN water vapour H2O spectroscopic
   compilation covering the blue spectral region (here: 394-480 nm)
   significant changes for the absorption bands at 416 and 426 nm were
   reported. In order to investigate the consistency of the different
   cross-sections calculated from these compilations, H2O vapour column
   density ratios for different spectral intervals were retrieved from
   long-path and multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy
   (DOAS) measurements. We observed a significant improvement of the DOAS
   evaluation when using the updated HITRAN water vapour absorption
   cross-sections for the calculation of the reference spectra. In
   particular the magnitudes of the residual spectra as well as the fit
   errors were reduced.
   However, we also found that the best match between measurement and model
   is reached when the absorption cross-section of groups of lines are
   scaled by factors ranging from 0.5 to 1.9, suggesting that the HITRAN
   water vapour absorption compilation still needs significant corrections.
   For this spectral region we present correction factors for HITRAN 2009,
   HITRAN 2012, HITEMP and BT2 derived from field measurements.
   Additionally, upper limits for water vapour absorption in the UV-A range
   from 330 to 390 nm are given.},

Abstract = {Composition of distant stars can be explored by observing absorption
   spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through
   the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic
   absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic
   composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with
   known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids,
   comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner.
   Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so
   bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density
   does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal
   generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular
   composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The
   concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a
   distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With
   sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature
   rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface
   occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and
   ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk
   composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated
   spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be
   created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot
   continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition
   profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with
   laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.},

Title = {{GARLIC - A general purpose atmospheric radiative transfer line-by-line
   infrared-microwave code: Implementation and evaluation}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {29-50},
Abstract = {A suite of programs for high resolution infrared-microwave atmospheric
   radiative transfer modeling has been developed with emphasis on
   efficient and reliable numerical algorithms and a modular approach
   appropriate for simulation and/or retrieval in a variety of
   applications. The Generic Atmospheric Radiation Line-by-line Infrared
   Code - GARLIC - is suitable for arbitrary observation geometry,
   instrumental field-of-view, and line shape. The core of GARLIC's
   subroutines constitutes the basis of forward models used to implement
   inversion codes to retrieve atmospheric state parameters from limb and
   nadir sounding instruments.
   This paper briefly introduces the physical and mathematical basics of
   GARLIC and its descendants and continues with an in-depth presentation
   of various implementation aspects: An optimized Voigt function algorithm
   combined with a two-grid approach is used to accelerate the line-by-line
   modeling of molecular cross sections; various quadrature methods are
   implemented to evaluate the Schwarzschild and Beer integrals; and
   Jacobians, i.e. derivatives with respect to the unknowns of the
   atmospheric inverse problem, are implemented by means of automatic
   differentiation. For an assessment of GARLIC's performance, a comparison
   of the quadrature methods for solution of the path integral is provided.
   Verification and validation are demonstrated using intercomparisons with
   other line-by-line codes and comparisons of synthetic spectra with
   spectra observed on Earth and from Venus.},

Journal = MP,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {2407-2418},
Abstract = {Jet-cooled spectra of (NH3)-N-14 and (NH3)-N-15 in natural abundance
   were recorded using cavity ring-down (CRDS, 6584-6670 cm(-1)) and cavity
   enhanced absorption (CEAS, 6530-6700 cm(-1)) spectroscopy. Line
   broadening effects in the CRDS spectrum allowed lines with J `'-values
   between 0 and 3 to be identified. Intensity ratios in (NH3)-N-14 between
   the jet-cooled CRDS and literature room-temperature data from Sung et
   al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113 (2012), 1066) further
   assisted the line assignments. Ground state combination differences were
   extensively used to support the assignments, providing reliable values
   for J, K and inversion symmetry of the ground state vibrational levels.
   CEAS data helped in this respect for the lowest J lines, some of which
   are saturated in the CRDS spectrum. Further information on a/s doublets
   arose from the observed spectral structures. Thirty-two transitions of
   (NH3)-N-14 were assigned in this way and a limited but significant
   number (19) of changes in the assignments results, compared to Sung et
   al. or to Cacciani et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113
   (2012), 1084). Sixteen known and 25 new low-J transitions were
   identified for (NH3)-N-15 in the CRDS spectrum but the much scarcer
   literature information did not allow for any more refined assignment.
   The present line position measurements improve on literature values
   published for (NH3)-N-15 and on some line positions for (NH3)-N-14.},

Volume = {130},
Pages = {392-399},
Abstract = {A new design is presented for a gas flow cell for reactive gases at high
   temperatures. The design features three heated sections that are
   separated by flow windows. This design avoids the contact of reactive
   gases with the material of the exchangeable optical windows. A gas cell
   with this design was validated for high resolution measurements at
   temperatures of up to 800 K (527 degrees C) in the ultraviolet (UV) and
   infrared (IR) regions (190-20 000 nm). Verification of the gas
   temperature in the cell is provided by a thermocouple and
   emission/transmission measurements in the IR and UV regions.
   High-resolution measurements are presented for the absorption
   cross-section of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the UV range up to 773 K (500
