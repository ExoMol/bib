Title = {Korg: Fitting, Model Atmosphere Interpolation, and Brackett Lines},
Journal =AJ,
Year = {2024},
Volume = {167},
Abstract = {We describe several updates to Korg, a package for 1D LTE spectral
   synthesis of FGKM stars. Built-in functions to fit observed spectra via
   synthesis or equivalent widths make it easy to take advantage of Korg's
   automatic differentiation. Comparison to a past analysis of 18 Sco shows
   that we obtain significantly reduced line-to-line abundance scatter with
   Korg. Fitting and synthesis are facilitated by a rigorously tested model
   atmosphere interpolation method, which introduces negligible error to
   synthesized spectra for stars with T eff greater than or similar to 4000
   K. For cooler stars, atmosphere interpolation is complicated by the
   presence of molecules, though we demonstrate an adequate method for cool
   dwarfs. The chemical equilibrium solver has been extended to include
   polyatomic and charged molecules, extending Korg's regime of
   applicability to M stars. We also discuss a common oversight regarding
   the synthesis of hydrogen lines in the infrared, and show that Korg's
   Brackett line profiles are a much closer match to observations than
   others available. Documentation, installation instructions, and
   tutorials are available at https://github.com/ajwheeler/Korg.jl.},

Title = {{Spatially resolved broadband absorption spectroscopy measurements of
   temperature and multiple species (NH, OH, NO, and NH3) in
   atmospheric-pressure premixed ammonia/methane/air flames}},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Abstract = {The temperature and multi-species concentration distributions, including
   NH, OH, NO, and NH3, are of great importance to the research on
   ammonia/methane combustion mechanisms. However, there is scarce research
   simultaneously measuring these parameters in atmospheric-pressure
   ammonia/methane flames. In this work, we proposed a measurement method
   based on the ultraviolet broadband absorption spectroscopy (BAS) to
   realize the simultaneous measurement of temperature and multiple species
   concentrations for the first time (absolute concentrations for OH, NH,
   and NO, and relative concentrations for NH3). Due to the strong
   absorption of the electronic transitions in the ultraviolet range, the
   proposed method offers low detection limits for concentration
   measurements. Taking NH radicals as an example, the detection limit is
   as low as 31 ppb at 1700 K. High sensitivity for temperature
   measurements is also achieved due to the multi-line spectra of OH
   broadband absorption. Moreover, a fitting strategy was proposed to
   separate the NO and NH3 spectra near 225 nm, enabling a simultaneous
   determination of both species. We established an optical system based on
   the proposed BAS method with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.1
   mm to perform spatially resolved measurements of temperature and
   multiple species on atmospheric ammonia/methane/air flames. The
   ammonia/methane flames were investigated at different equivalence ratios
   (0.9, 1.0, and 1.1) and different ammonia mole fractions in fuels (10\%,
   30\%, and 50\%). As investigated, NH and NH3 concentrations increased
   linearly with increasing ammonia mole fractions, while OH and NO
   concentrations decreased in similar trends with increasing equivalence
   ratios. The experimentally measured temperature and multi-species
   concentrations were compared with computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   simulations using the mechanism of the CRECK modeling group. Good
   agreements were achieved in absolute values, spatial profiles, and
   variations with equivalence ratios and ammonia mole fractions.},

title = {The Arizona Radio Observatory 1 mm Spectral Survey of the Hypergiant Star NML Cygni (215–285 GHz)},
journal = AJ,
abstract = {A sensitive (1σ rms ≤ 3 mK; 2 MHz resolution) 1 mm spectral survey (214.5–285.5 GHz) of the envelope of the oxygen-rich supergiant star NML Cygni (NML Cyg) has been conducted using the 10 m Submillimeter Telescope of the Arizona Radio Observatory. These data represent the first spectral line survey of NML Cyg and are complementary to a previous 1 mm survey of the envelope of a similar hypergiant, VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa). The complete NML Cyg data set is presented here. In the survey, 104 emission lines were observed, arising from 17 different molecules and 4 unidentified features. Many of the observed features have complex line profiles, arising from asymmetric outflows characteristic of hypergiant stars. While most of the lines in the survey arise from SiO, SO, SO2, and SiS, CO had the strongest emission. Five other C-bearing species are identified in the survey (HCN, CN, HCO+, CS, and HNC), demonstrating an active carbon chemistry despite the O-rich environment. Moreover, NS was observed, but not NO, although favorable transitions of both molecules lie in the surveyed region. Sulfur chemistry appears to be prominent in NML Cyg and plays an important role in the collimated outflows. The refractory species observed, NaCl and AlO, have narrow emission lines, indicating that these molecules do not reach the terminal expansion velocity. NaCl and AlO likely condense into dust grains at r &lt; 50 R *. From NaCl, the chlorine isotope ratio was determined to be 35Cl/37Cl = 3.85 ± 0.30.}

Title = {{The solar carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen abundances from a 3D LTE analysis
   of molecular lines}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{656}},
pages={A113},
Abstract = {{Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the fourth, sixth, and third most
   abundant elements in the Sun. Their abundances remain hotly debated due
   to the so-called solar modelling problem that has persisted for almost
   20 years. We revisit this issue by presenting a homogeneous analysis of
   408 molecular lines across 12 diagnostic groups, observed in the solar
   intensity spectrum. Using a realistic 3D radiative-hydrodynamic model
   solar photosphere and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) line
   formation, we find log C-C = 8:47 +/- 0:02, log epsilon(N) = 7:89 +/-
   0:04, and log epsilon(O)= 8:70 +/- 0:04. The stipulated uncertainties
   mainly reflect the sensitivity of the results to the model atmosphere;
   this sensitivity is correlated between the different diagnostic groups,
   which all agree with the mean result to within 0:03 dex. For carbon and
   oxygen, the molecular results are in excellent agreement with our 3D
   non-LTE analyses of atomic lines. For nitrogen, however, the molecular
   indicators give a 0:12 dex larger abundance than the atomic indicators,
   and our best estimate of the solar nitrogen abundance is given by the
   mean: 7:83 dex. The solar oxygen abundance advocated here is close to
   our earlier determination of 8:69 dex, and so the present results do not
   significantly alleviate the solar modelling problem.}},

Title = {{GSP-spec line list for the parametrisation of Gaia-RVS stellar spectra}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{654}},
Abstract = {{Context. The Gaia mission is a magnitude-limited whole-sky survey that
   collects an impressive quantity of astrometric, spectro-photometric and
   spectroscopic data. Among all the on-board instruments, the Radial
   Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) produces millions of spectra up to a
   magnitude of G(RVS) similar to 16. For the brightest RVS targets,
   stellar atmospheric parameters and individual chemical abundances are
   automatically estimated by the Generalized Stellar Parametriser -
   spectroscopy group (GSP-Spec). These data will be published with the
   third Gaia Data Release.
   Aims. Some major ingredients of the determination of these stellar
   parameters include the atomic and molecular line lists that are adopted
   to compute reference synthetic spectra, on which the parametrisation
   methods rely. We aim to build such a specific line list optimised for
   the analysis of RVS late-type star spectra.
   Methods. Starting from the Gaia-ESO line lists, we first compared the
   observed and synthetic spectra of six well-known reference late-type
   stars in the wavelength range covered by the RVS instrument. We then
   improved the quality of the atomic data for the transitions presenting
   the largest mismatches.
   Results. The new line list is found to produce very high-quality
   synthetic spectra for the tested reference stars and has thus been
   adopted within GSP-Spec. We note, however, that a couple of atomic line
   profiles, in particular the calcium infrared triplet lines, still show
   some deviations compared to the reference spectra, probably because of
   the adopted line-transfer assumptions (local thermodynamical
   equilibrium, hydrostatic, and no chromosphere). Future works should
   focus on such lines and should extend the present work towards OBA and
   M-type stellar spectra.}},

   Line Survey}},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{920}},
Abstract = {{A sensitive (1 sigma rms <= 3 mK) 1 mm spectral survey (214.5-285.5 GHz)
   of the oxygen-rich circumstellar envelope of the red hypergiant NML
   Cygni (NML Cyg) has been conducted using the Sub-millimeter Telescope
   (SMT) of the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO). Over 100 spectral lines
   were detected, arising from 17 different molecules, including the
   carbon-bearing species CO, HCN, HCO+, CN, and HNC; sulfur- and
   silicon-containing compounds H2S, SO, SO2, SiO, and SiS; and more exotic
   NaCl and AlO. The 1 mm spectrum of NML Cyg closely resembles that of VY
   Canis Majoris (VY CMa) suggesting that the chemistries of hypergiant
   stars are similar. The line profiles in NML Cyg consist of multiple
   velocity features, particularly evident in SO2 and SO. In addition to a
   spherical wind at the star's systemic velocity, the spectra suggest an
   asymmetric, blueshifted component near V (LSR) = -21 +/- 3 km s(-1) and
   a collimated, redshifted component near 15 +/- 3 km s(-1), positioned
   similar to 34 degrees and similar to 12 degrees, respectively, from the
   line of sight. The red- and blueshifted flows appear to be randomly
   oriented, and likely trace sporadic mass loss events. Their LSR
   velocities align closely with those of 22 GHz water masers, suggesting
   an NE-SE orientation. The winds may also be associated with the
   asymmetric nebula in F555W HST images but extending to 5 `' (similar to
   600R ({*})). NML Cyg appears to be another example of rare, massive
   stars with collimated, episodic ejections, analogous to Betelgeuse and
   VY CMa, lending support for an important new mass loss mechanism-surface
   activity.}},

First we describe how SPEARS integrates a physics-based collisional model for calculating pressure broadening in the absence of available broadening coefficients. With this collisional model implementation, a generalized approach to fundamental spectroscopic databases can be achieved across multiple databases. We also detail our adaptive grid mesh algorithm developed to make the code scalable for simulating large spectral bandwidths at high spectral fidelity using intuitive grid parameters. We present comparisons to other modeling tools, experiments, and provide a discussion on the SPEARS user interface.}

Laser energy heats a local area on the substrate; flux is optimized to melt and evaporate target constituents with low rates of molecular dissociation. Substrate temperature rises until an equilibrium is established between incident flux and latent phase-change energies, reaching ˜2500 K in vacuum. A blackbody signal is emitted by the heated spot, traveling outward through the evaporated material; reflective optics direct the signal into a spectrometer. Ro-vibrational absorption in the plume provides a diagnostic for identifying bulk molecular composition of the substrate. Absorption spectra are modeled for compounds with available a priori molecular cross-sections, based on laser and receiver characteristics, and target material properties. Mass ejection flux drives the plume density profile. Qualitative, species-specific spectral profiles are derived by integrating molecular cross section along a path through the plume. Simulations indicate robust absorption profiles. }

Abstract = {Composition of distant stars can be explored by observing absorption
   spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through
   the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic
   absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic
   composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with
   known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids,
   comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner.
   Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so
   bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density
   does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal
   generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular
   composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The
   concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a
   distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With
   sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature
   rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface
   occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and
   ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk
   composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated
   spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be
   created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot
   continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition
   profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with
   laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.},

Abstract = {A suite of programs for high resolution infrared-microwave atmospheric
   radiative transfer modeling has been developed with emphasis on
   efficient and reliable numerical algorithms and a modular approach
   appropriate for simulation and/or retrieval in a variety of
   applications. The Generic Atmospheric Radiation Line-by-line Infrared
   Code - GARLIC - is suitable for arbitrary observation geometry,
   instrumental field-of-view, and line shape. The core of GARLIC's
   subroutines constitutes the basis of forward models used to implement
   inversion codes to retrieve atmospheric state parameters from limb and
   nadir sounding instruments.
   This paper briefly introduces the physical and mathematical basics of
   GARLIC and its descendants and continues with an in-depth presentation
   of various implementation aspects: An optimized Voigt function algorithm
   combined with a two-grid approach is used to accelerate the line-by-line
   modeling of molecular cross sections; various quadrature methods are
   implemented to evaluate the Schwarzschild and Beer integrals; and
   Jacobians, i.e. derivatives with respect to the unknowns of the
   atmospheric inverse problem, are implemented by means of automatic
   differentiation. For an assessment of GARLIC's performance, a comparison
   of the quadrature methods for solution of the path integral is provided.
   Verification and validation are demonstrated using intercomparisons with
   other line-by-line codes and comparisons of synthetic spectra with

   the jet-cooled CRDS and literature room-temperature data from Sung et

   assisted the line assignments. Ground state combination differences were
   extensively used to support the assignments, providing reliable values
   for J, K and inversion symmetry of the ground state vibrational levels.
   CEAS data helped in this respect for the lowest J lines, some of which
   are saturated in the CRDS spectrum. Further information on a/s doublets
   arose from the observed spectral structures. Thirty-two transitions of
   (NH3)-N-14 were assigned in this way and a limited but significant

   al. or to Cacciani et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113
   (2012), 1084). Sixteen known and 25 new low-J transitions were
   identified for (NH3)-N-15 in the CRDS spectrum but the much scarcer
   literature information did not allow for any more refined assignment.
   The present line position measurements improve on literature values
   published for (NH3)-N-15 and on some line positions for (NH3)-N-14.},
