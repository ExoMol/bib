Abstract = {{A planetary atmosphere is the outer gas layer of a planet. Besides its
   scientific significance among the first and most accessible planetary
   layers observed from space, it is closely connected with planetary
   formation and evolution, surface and interior processes, and
   habitability of planets. Current theories of planetary atmospheres were
   primarily obtained through the studies of eight large planets, Pluto and
   three large moons (Io, Titan, and Triton) in the Solar System. Outside
   the Solar System, more than four thousand extrasolar planets
   (exoplanets) and two thousand brown dwarfs have been confirmed in our
   Galaxy, and their population is rapidly growing. The rich information
   from these exotic bodies offers a database to test, in a statistical
   sense, the fundamental theories of planetary climates. Here we review
   the current knowledge on atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs from
   recent observations and theories. This review highlights important
   regimes and statistical trends in an ensemble of atmospheres as an
   initial step towards fully characterizing diverse substellar
   atmospheres, that illustrates the underlying principles and critical
   problems. Insights are obtained through analysis of the dependence of
   atmospheric characteristics on basic planetary parameters. Dominant
   processes that influence atmospheric stability, energy transport,
   temperature, composition and flow pattern are discussed and elaborated
   with simple scaling laws. We dedicate this review to Dr. Adam P. Showman
   (1968-2020) in recognition of his fundamental contribution to the
   understanding of atmospheric dynamics on giant planets, exoplanets and
   brown dwarfs.}},

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{636}},
Abstract = {{Context. Little is known about the interaction between atmospheres and
   crusts of exoplanets so far, but future space missions and ground-based
   instruments are expected to detect molecular features in the spectra of
   hot rocky exoplanets.
   Aims. We aim to understand the composition of the gas in an exoplanet
   atmosphere which is in equilibrium with a planetary crust.
   Methods. The molecular composition of the gas above a surface made of a
   mixture of solid and liquid materials was determined by assuming phase
   equilibrium for given pressure, temperature, and element abundances. We
   study total element abundances that represent different parts of the
   Earth's crust (continental crust, bulk silicate Earth, mid oceanic ridge
   basalt), CI chondrites and abundances measured in polluted white dwarfs.
   Results. For temperatures between 600 and 3500 K, the near-crust
   atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly
   composed of H2O, CO2, and SO2 and in some cases of O-2 and H-2. For
   temperatures less than or similar to 500 K, only N-2-rich or CH4-rich
   atmospheres remain. For greater than or similar to 3500 K, the
   atmospheric gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, and Fe), metal
   oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO, CaO, AlO, and FeO), and some metal hydroxides
   (KOH and NaOH). The inclusion of phyllosilicates as potential condensed
   species is crucial for lower temperatures, as they can remove water from
   the gas phase below about 700 K and inhibit the presence of liquid
   water.
   Conclusions. Measurements of the atmospheric composition could, in
   principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet crusts. H2O,
   O-2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different kinds
   of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as
   biomarkers, but they do emerge naturally as a result of the
   thermodynamic interaction between the crust and atmosphere. Only the
   simultaneous detection of all three molecules might be a sufficient
   biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical equilibrium.}},

We explore how the transmission spectrum of Earth changed through its geological history. These transmission spectra provide a template for how to characterize an Earth-like exoplanet—from a young prebiotic world to a modern Earth. They also allow us to explore at what point in its evolution a distant observer could identify life on our Pale Blue Dots and other worlds like it. We chose atmosphere models representative of five geological epochs of Earth’s history, corresponding to a prebiotic high CO2-world 3.9 billion years ago (Ga), an anoxic world around 3.5 Ga, and 3 epochs through the rise of oxygen from 0.2% to present atmospheric levels of 21%. Our transmission spectra show atmospheric spectral features, which would show a remote observer that Earth had a biosphere since about 2 billion years ago. The high-resolution transmission spectral database of Earth through geological time from the VIS to the IR is available online and can be used as a tool to optimize our observation strategy, train retrieval methods, and interpret upcoming observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, the Extremely Large Telescopes, and future mission concepts like Origins, HabEx, and LUOVIR.}

Title = {{New chemical scheme for giant planet thermochemistry Update of the
   methanol chemistry and new reduced chemical scheme}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{634}},
Abstract = {{Context. Several chemical networks have been developed to study warm
   (exo)planetary atmospheres. The kinetics of the reactions related to the
   methanol chemistry included in these schemes have been questioned.
   Aims. The goal of this paper is to update the methanol chemistry for
   such chemical networks based on recent publications in the combustion
   literature. We also aim to study the consequences of this update on the
   atmospheric compositions of (exo)planetary atmospheres and brown dwarfs.
   Methods. We performed an extensive review of combustion experimental
   studies and revisited the sub-mechanism describing methanol combustion
   in a scheme published in 2012. The updated scheme involves 108 species
   linked by a total of 1906 reactions. We then applied our 1D kinetic
   model with this new scheme to the case studies HD 209458b, HD 189733b,
   GJ 436b, GJ 1214b, ULAS J1335+11, Uranus, and Neptune; we compared these
   results with those obtained with the former scheme.
   Results. The update of the scheme has a negligible impact on the
   atmospheres of hot Jupiters. However, the atmospheric composition of
   warm Neptunes and brown dwarfs is modified sufficiently to impact
   observational spectra in the wavelength range in which James Webb Space
   Telescope will operate. Concerning Uranus and Neptune, the update of the
   chemical scheme modifies the abundance of CO and thus impacts the deep
   oxygen abundance required to reproduce the observational data. For
   future 3D kinetics models, we also derived a reduced scheme containing
   44 species and 582 reactions.
   Conclusions. Chemical schemes should be regularly updated to maintain a
   high level of reliability on the results of kinetic models and be able
   to improve our knowledge of planetary formation.}},

Title = {{Detecting isotopologues in exoplanet atmospheres using ground-based
   high-dispersion spectroscopy}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{622}},
Abstract = {{Context. The cross-correlation technique is a well-tested method for
   exoplanet characterization, having lead to the detection of various
   molecules, to constraints on atmospheric temperature profiles, wind
   speeds, and planetary spin rates. A new, potentially powerful
   application of this technique is the measurement of atmospheric isotope
   ratios. In particular D/H can give unique insights into the formation
   and evolution of planets, and their atmospheres.
   Aims. In this paper we aim to study the detectability of molecular
   isotopologues in the high-dispersion spectra of exoplanet atmospheres,
   to identify the optimal wavelength ranges to conduct such studies, and
   to predict the required observational efforts - both with current and
   future ground-based instrumentation.
   Methods. High-dispersion (R = 100 000) thermal emission spectra, and in
   some cases reflection spectra, were simulated by self-consistent
   modeling of the atmospheric structures and abundances of exoplanets over
   a wide range of effective temperatures. These were synthetically
   observed with a telescope equivalent to the VLT and/or ELT, and analyzed
   using the cross-correlation technique, resulting in signal-to-noise
   ratio predictions for the (CO)-C-13, HDO, and CH3D isotopologues.
   Results. We find that for the best observable exoplanets, (CO)-C-13 is
   well in range of current telescopes. We predict it will be most
   favorably detectable at 2.4 mu m, just longward of the wavelength
   regions probed by several high-dispersion spectroscopic observations
   presented in the literature. CH3D can be best targeted at 4.7 mu m, and
   may be detectable using 40 m-class telescopes for planets below 600 K in
   equilibrium temperature. In this case, the sky background becomes the
   dominating noise source for self-luminous planets. HDO is best targeted
   at 3.7 mu m, and is less affected by sky background noise. 40 m-class
   telescopes may lead to its detection for planets with T-equ below 900 K.
   It could already be in the range of current 8 m-class telescopes in the
   case of quenched methane abundances. Finally, if Proxima Cen b is
   water-rich, the HDO isotopologue could be detected with the ELT in
   similar to 1 night of observing time in its reflected-light spectrum.
   Conclusions. Isotopologues will soon be a part of the exoplanet
   characterisation tools. Measuring D/H in exoplanets, and ratios of other
   isotopes, could become a prime science case for the first-light
   instrument METIS on the European ELT, especially for nearby temperate
   rocky and ice giant planets. This can provide unique insights in their
   history of icy-body enrichment and atmospheric evaporation processes.}},

Title = {{Self-luminous and Irradiated Exoplanetary Atmospheres Explored with
   HELIOS}},
Journal = AJ,
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{157}},
Abstract = {{We present new methodological features and physical ingredients included
   in the one-dimensional radiative transfer code HELIOS, improving the
   hemispheric two-stream formalism. We conduct a thorough intercomparison
   survey with several established forward models, including COOLTLUSTY and
   PHOENIX, and find satisfactory consistency with their results. Then, we
   explore the impact of (i) different groups of opacity sources, (ii) a
   stellar path length adjustment, and (iii) a scattering correction on
   self-consistently calculated atmospheric temperatures and planetary
   emission spectra. First, we observe that temperature-pressure (T-P)
   profiles are very sensitive to the opacities included, with metal
   oxides, hydrides, and alkali atoms (and ionized hydrogen) playing an
   important role in the absorption of shortwave radiation (in very hot
   surroundings). Moreover, if these species are sufficiently abundant,
   they are likely to induce nonmonotonic T-P profiles. Second, without the
   stellar path length adjustment, the incoming stellar flux is
   significantly underestimated for zenith angles above 80 degrees, which
   somewhat affects the upper atmospheric temperatures and the planetary
   emission. Third, the scattering correction improves the accuracy of the
   computation of the reflected stellar light by similar to 10\%. We use
   HELIOS to calculate a grid of cloud-free atmospheres in
   radiative-convective equilibrium for self-luminous planets for a range
   of effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and C/O
   ratios to be used by planetary evolution studies. Furthermore, we
   calculate dayside temperatures and secondary eclipse spectra for a
   sample of exoplanets for varying chemistry and heat redistribution.
   These results may be used to make predictions on the feasibility of
   atmospheric characterizations with future observations.}},

Title = {{A Ground-based Near-ultraviolet Secondary Eclipse Observation of KELT-9b}},
Journal = ApJl,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{869}},
Abstract = {{KELT-9b is a recently discovered exoplanet with a 1.49 day orbit around
   a B9.5/A0-type star. The unparalleled levels of ultraviolet irradiation
   that it receives from its host star put KELT-9b in its own unique class
   of ultra-hot Jupiters, with an equilibrium temperature >4000 K. The high
   quantities of dissociated hydrogen and atomic metals present in the
   dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b bear more resemblance to a K-type star
   than a gas giant. We present a single observation of KELT-9b during its
   secondary eclipse, taken with the Wide Field Camera on the Isaac Newton
   Telescope (INT). This observation was taken in the U-band, a window
   particularly sensitive to Rayleigh scattering. We do not detect a
   secondary eclipse signal, but our 3 sigma upper limit of 181 ppm on the
   depth allows us to constrain the dayside temperature of KELT-9b at
   pressures of similar to 30 mbar to 4995 K (3 sigma). Although we can
   place an observational constraint of A(g) < 0.14, our models suggest
   that the actual value is considerably lower than this due to H- opacity.
   This places KELT-9b squarely in the albedo regime populated by its
   cooler cousins, almost all of which reflect very small components of the
   light incident on their daysides. This work demonstrates the ability of
   ground-based 2 m class telescopes like the INT to perform secondary
   eclipse studies in the near-ultraviolet, which have previously only been
   conducted from space-based facilities.}},

Journal = MNRAS,

Pages = {4261-4276},
Abstract = {{We present 10 high-precision light curves of four transits in the XO-1
   planetary system, obtained using u, g, r, redshifted H alpha, I, and z
   filters. We use these to measure the physical properties, orbital
   ephemeris, and a transmission spectrum of the planet covering the full
   optical wavelength range. We augment this with published HST/WFC3
   observations to construct a transmission spectrum of the planet covering
   0.37-1.65 mu m. Our best-fitting model to this spectrum is for a
   H-2/He-rich atmosphere containing water (3.05 sigma confidence),
   nitrogen-bearing molecules NH3 and HCN (1.5 sigma) and patchy cloud (1.3
   sigma). We find that adding the optical to the near-infrared data does
   not lead to more precise constraints on the planetary atmosphere in this
   case. We conduct a detailed investigation into the effect of stellar
   limb darkening on our results, concluding that the choice of limb
   darkening law and coefficients is unimportant; such conclusions may not
   hold for other systems so should be reassessed for all high-quality data
   sets. The planet radius we measure in the g band is anomalously low and
   should be investigated with future observations at a higher spectral
   resolution. From the measured times of transit, we determine an improved
   orbital ephemeris, calculate a lower limit on the modified stellar tidal
   quality factor of Q({*})(1) > 10(5.6), and rule out a previously
   postulated sinusoidal variation in the transit times.}},

Abstract = {{The Mid-Infrared instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space
   Telescope will perform the first ever characterization of young giant
   exoplanets observed by direct imaging in the 5-28 mu m spectral range.
   This wavelength range is key for both determining the bolometric
   luminosity of the cool known exoplanets and for accessing the strongest
   ammonia bands. In conjunction with shorter wavelength observations, MIRI
   will enable a more accurate characterization of the exoplanetary
   atmospheric properties. Here we consider a subsample of the currently
   known exoplanets detected by direct imaging, and we discuss their
   detectability with MIRI, either using the coronagraphic or the
   spectroscopic modes. By using the Exo-REM atmosphere model, we calculate
   the mid-infrared emission spectra of 14 exoplanets, and we simulate MIRI

   four coronagraphic observational setups, which depend on (i) the
   target-star and reference-star offset (0, 3, 14 mas), (ii) the
   wavefront-error (130, 204 nm root mean square), and (iii) the telescope
   jitter amplitude (1.6, 7 mas). We then determine the signal-to-noise and
   integration time values for the coronagraphic targets whose
   planet-to-star contrasts range from 3.9 to 10.1 mag. We conclude that
   all the MIRI targets should be observable with different degrees of
   difficulty, which depends on the final in-flight instrument
   performances. Furthermore, we test for detection of ammonia in the
   atmosphere of the coolest targets. Finally, we present the case of HR
   8799 b to discuss what MIRI observations can bring to the knowledge of a

First results suggest that it is teeming with a fascinating diversity of rocky planets, including those in the habitable zone. Even our closest star, Proxima Centauri, harbors a small planet in its habitable zone, Proxima b. With the next generation of telescopes, we will be able to peer into the atmospheres of rocky planets and get a glimpse into other worlds. Using our own planet and its wide range of biota as a Rosetta stone, we explore how we could detect habitability and signs of life on exoplanets over interstellar distances. Current telescopes are not yet powerful enough to characterize habitable exoplanets, but the next generation of telescopes that is already being built will have the capabilities to characterize close-by habitable worlds. The discussion on what makes a planet a habitat and how to detect signs of life is lively. This review will show the latest results, the challenges of how to identify and characterize such habitable worlds, and how near-future telescopes will revolutionize the field. For the first time in human history, we have developed the technology to detect potential habitable worlds. Finding thousands of exoplanets has taken the field of comparative planetology beyond the Solar System. }

Journal = {Nature},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{546}},
Pages = {514+},
Abstract = {{The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a
   planet depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the
   thousands of extrasolar planets now known, only six have been found that
   transit hot, A-type stars (with temperatures of 7,300-10,000 kelvin),
   and no planets are known to transit the even hotter B-type stars. For
   example, WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature of about 7,430
   kelvin, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet, WASP-33b (ref.
   1); the planet is itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M (ref. 2).
   WASP-33b displays a large heat differential between its dayside and
   nightside(2), and is highly inflated-traits that have been linked to
   high insolation(3,4). However, even at the temperature of its dayside,
   its atmosphere probably resembles the molecule-dominated atmospheres of
   other planets and, given the level of ultraviolet irradiation it
   experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be substantially ablated over
   the lifetime of its star. Here we report observations of the bright star
   HD 195689 (also known as KELT-9), which reveal a close-in (orbital
   period of about 1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At
   approximately 10,170 kelvin, the host star is at the dividing line
   between stars of type A and B, and we measure the dayside temperature of
   KELT-9b to be about 4,600 kelvin. This is as hot as stars of stellar
   type K4 (ref. 5). The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and
   so the primary sources of opacity in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b
   are probably atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives 700 times more
   extreme-ultraviolet radiation (that is, with wavelengths shorter than
   91.2 nanometres) than WASP-33b, leading to a predicted range of
   mass-loss rates that could leave the planet largely stripped of its
   envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host star(6).}},

Volume = {{153}},
Abstract = {{Observations of extended atmospheres around hot planets have generated
   exciting results concerning the dynamics of escaping planetary material.
   The configuration of the escaping planetary gas can result in asymmetric
   transit features, producing both pre- and post-transit absorption in
   specific atomic transitions. Measuring the velocity and strength of the
   absorption can provide constraints on the mass loss mechanism, and
   potentially clues to the interactions between the planet and the host
   star. Here we present a search for Ha absorption in the circumplanetary
   environments of the hot planets KELT-3 b and GJ 436 b. We find no
   evidence for absorption around either planet at any point during the two
   separate transit epochs for which each system was observed. We provide
   upper limits on the radial extent and density of the excited hydrogen
   atmospheres around both planets. The null detection for GJ 436 b
   contrasts with the strong Ly alpha absorption measured for the same
   system, suggesting that the large cloud of neutral hydrogen is almost
   entirely in the ground state. The only confirmed exoplanetary H alpha
   absorption to date has been made around the active star HD 189733 b.
   KELT-3 and GJ 436 are less active than HD 189733, hinting that exoplanet

   period and high irradiation make it a benchmark target for atmospheric

   WASP-43b, KELT16b may feature an atmospheric temperaturepressure
   inversion and daytonight temperature swing extreme enough for TiO to
   rain out at the terminator. KELT-16b could also join WASP-43b in
   extending tests of the observed mass-metallicity relation of the solar
   system gas giants to higher masses. KELT-16b currently orbits at a mere
   similar to 1.7 Roche radii from its host star, and could be tidally
   disrupted in as little as a few x10(5) years ( for a stellar tidal
   quality factor of Q({*}) = 10(5)). Finally, the likely existence of a

   KELT-16b inward to its current precarious orbit.}},

atmospheres exist, mostly adapted from other astrophysical applications, with different
levels of sophistication and accuracy. There is a growing need for a new generation
of models custom-built for exoplanets and incorporating state-of-the-art numerical
methods and opacities. The present work is a step in this direction. Here we introduce
genesis, a plane-parallel, self-consistent, line-by-line exoplanetary atmospheric
modelling code that includes (a) formal solution of radiative transfer using the
Feautrier method, (b) radiativeÃ¢Â€Â“convective equilibrium with temperature correction
based on the Rybicki linearization scheme, (c) latest absorption cross-sections,
and (d) internal flux and external irradiation, under the assumptions of hydrostatic
equilibrium, local thermodynamic equilibrium and thermochemical equilibrium. We
demonstrate the code here with cloud-free models of giant exoplanetary atmospheres
over a range of equilibrium temperatures, metallicities, C/O ratios and spanning
non-irradiated and irradiated planets, with and without thermal inversions. We
provide the community with theoretical emergent spectra and pressureÃ¢Â€Â“temperature
profiles over this range, along with those for several known hot Jupiters. The
code can generate self-consistent spectra at high resolution and has the potential
to be integrated into general circulation and non-equilibrium chemistry models as
it is optimized for efficiency and convergence. genesis paves the way for high-fidelity
remote sensing of exoplanetary atmospheres at high resolution with current and upcoming observations.},

On the other hand, we find an unexpected excess in the KS band measured flux compared
to these models, which requires confirmation with additional observations before
any interpretation can be given. From our global data analysis, we also derive a
broad-band optical transmission spectrum that shows a minimum around 700 nm and
increasing values towards both shorter and longer wavelengths. This is in agreement
with a previous study based on a large fraction of the archival transit light curves
used in our analysis. The unusual profile of this transmission spectrum is poorly
matched by theoretical spectra and is not confirmed by more recent observations at
higher spectral resolution. Additional data, in both emission and transmission, are

Abstract = {{To study the complexity of hot Jupiter atmospheres revealed by
   observations of increasing quality, we have adapted the UK Met Office
   Global Circulation Model (GCM), the Unified Model (UM), to these
   exoplanets. The UM solves the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations with a
   height-varying gravity, avoiding the simplifications used in most GCMs
   currently applied to exoplanets. In this work we present the coupling of
   the UM dynamical core to an accurate radiation scheme based on the
   two-stream approximation and correlated-k method with state-of-the-art
   opacities from ExoMol. Our first application of this model is devoted to
   the extensively studied hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We have derived
   synthetic emission spectra and phase curves, and compare them to both
   previous models also based on state-of-the-art radiative transfer, and
   to observations. We find a reasonable agreement between observations and
   both our days side emission and hot spot offset, however, our night side
   emissions is too large. Overall our results are qualitatively similar to
   those found by Showman et al. (2009, ApJ, 699, 564) with the
   SPARC/MITgcm, however, we note several quantitative differences: Our
   simulations show significant variation in the position of the hottest
   part of the atmosphere with pressure, as expected from simple timescale
   arguments, and in contrast to the ``vertical coherency{''} found by
   Showman et al. (2009). We also see significant quantitative differences
   in calculated synthetic observations. Our comparisons strengthen the
   need for detailed intercomparisons of dynamical cores, radiation schemes
   and post-processing tools to understand these differences. This effort
   is necessary in order to make robust conclusions about these atmospheres
   based on GCM results.}},

Title = {{ON THE COMPOSITION OF YOUNG, DIRECTLY IMAGED GIANT PLANETS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{829}},
Abstract = {{The past decade has seen significant progress on the direct detection
   and characterization of young, self-luminous giant planets at wide
   orbital separations from their host stars. Some of these planets show
   evidence for disequilibrium processes like transport-induced quenching
   in their atmospheres; photochemistry may also be important, despite the
   large orbital distances. These disequilibrium chemical processes can
   alter the expected composition, spectral behavior, thermal structure,
   and cooling history of the planets, and can potentially confuse
   determinations of bulk elemental ratios, which provide important
   insights into planet-formation mechanisms. Using a thermo/photochemical
   kinetics and transport model, we investigate the extent to which
   disequilibrium chemistry affects the composition and spectra of directly
   imaged giant exoplanets. Results for specific ``young Jupiters{''} such
   as HR 8799 b and 51 Eri b are presented, as are general trends as a
   function of planetary effective temperature, surface gravity, incident
   ultraviolet flux, and strength of deep atmospheric convection. We find
   that quenching is very important on young Jupiters, leading to CO/CH4
   and N-2/NH3 ratios much greater than, and H2O mixing ratios a factor of
   a few less than, chemical-equilibrium predictions. Photochemistry can
   also be important on such planets, with CO2 and HCN being key
   photochemical products. Carbon dioxide becomes a major constituent when
   stratospheric temperatures are low and recycling of water via the H-2 +
   OH reaction becomes kinetically stifled. Young Jupiters with effective
   temperatures less than or similar to 700 K are in a particularly
   interesting photochemical regime that differs from both transiting hot
   Jupiters and our own solar-system giant planets.}},

The 1.4 ÃŽÂ¼ m water absorption band is detected at high confidence (5.4 ÃÂƒ ) in the planetary atmosphere. We also reanalyze ground-based photometric light curves taken in the B , r Ã¢Â€Â², and z Ã¢Â€Â² filters. Significantly deeper transits are measured in these optical bandpasses relative to the near-infrared wavelengths. We conclude that scattering by high-altitude haze alone is unlikely to account for this difference and instead interpret it as evidence for titanium oxide and vanadium oxide absorption. Enhanced opacity is also inferred across the 1.12--1.3 ÃŽÂ¼ m wavelength range, possibly due to iron hydride absorption. If confirmed, WASP-121b will be the first exoplanet with titanium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron hydride detected in transmission. The latter are important species in M/L dwarfs and their presence is likely to have a significant effect on the overall physics and chemistry of the atmosphere, including the production of a strong thermal inversion.},

   AND ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR ARBITRARY C/O},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2016},
Volume = {816},
Abstract = {We present a self-consistent formalism for computing and understanding
   the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets from the viewpoint of an
   astrophysicist. Starting from the first law of thermodynamics, we
   demonstrate that the van't Hoff equation (which describes the
   equilibrium constant), Arrhenius equation (which describes the rate
   coefficients), and procedures associated with the Gibbs free energy
   (minimization, rescaling) have a common physical and mathematical
   origin. We address an ambiguity associated with the equilibrium
   constant, which is used to relate the forward and reverse rate
   coefficients, and restate its two definitions. By necessity, one of the
   equilibrium constants must be dimensionless and equate to an exponential
   function involving the Gibbs free energy, while the other is a ratio of
   rate coefficients and must therefore possess physical units. We
   demonstrate that the Arrhenius equation takes on a functional form that
   is more general than previously stated without recourse to tagging on ad
   hoc functional forms. Finally, we derive analytical models of chemical
   systems, in equilibrium, with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. We include
   acetylene and are able to reproduce several key trends, versus
   temperature and carbon-to-oxygen ratio, published in the literature. The
   rich variety of behavior that mixing ratios exhibit as a function of the
   carbon-to-oxygen ratio is merely the outcome of stoichiometric
   book-keeping and not the direct consequence of temperature or pressure
   variations.},

We are developing a new atmospheric retrieval methodology to help assess the science return and inform the instrument design for such future missions, and ultimately interpret the resulting observations. Our retrieval technique employs a geometric albedo model coupled with both a Markov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble Sampler ( emcee ) and a multimodal nested sampling algorithm ( MultiNest ) to map the posterior distribution. This combination makes the global evidence calculation more robust for any given model and highlights possible discrepancies in the likelihood maps. As a proof of concept, our current atmospheric model contains one or two cloud layers, methane as a major absorber, and a H 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã¢Â€ÂœHe background gas. This 6-to-9 parameter model is appropriate for Jupiter-like planets and can be easily expanded in the future. In addition to deriving the marginal likelihood distribution and confidence intervals for the model parameters, we perform model selection to determine the significance of methane and cloud detection as a function of expected signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of spectral noise correlations. After internal validation, the method is applied to realistic spectra of Jupiter, Saturn, and HD 99492c, a model observing target. We find that the presence or absence of clouds and methane can be determined with high confidence, while parameter uncertainties are model dependent and correlated. Such general methods will also be applicable to the interpretation of direct imaging spectra of cloudy terrestrial planets.}

  abstract={GJ 1132b is a nearby Earth-sized exoplanet transiting an M dwarf, and is among the most highly characterizable small exoplanets currently known. In this paper,Ã‚Â we study the interaction of a magma ocean with a water-rich atmosphere on GJ 1132b and determine that it must have begun with more than 5 wt% initial water in order to still retain a water-based atmosphere. We also determine the amount of O 2 that can build up in the atmosphere as a result of hydrogen dissociation and loss. We find that the magma ocean absorbs at most Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼10% of the O 2 produced, whereas more than 90% is lost to space through hydrodynamic drag. The most common outcome for GJ 1132b from our simulations is a tenuous atmosphere dominated by O 2 , though, for very large initial water abundances,Ã‚Â atmospheres with several thousands of bars of O 2 are possible. A substantial steam envelope would indicate either the existence of an earlier H 2 envelope or low XUV flux over the systemÃ¢Â€Â™s lifetime. A steam atmosphere would also imply the continued existence of a magma ocean on GJ 1132b. Further modeling is needed to study the evolution of CO 2 or N 2 -rich atmospheres on GJ 1132b.}

  abstract={The admitted, conventional scenario to explain the complex spectral evolution of brown dwarfs (BDs) since their first detectionÃ‚Â 20 years agoÃ‚Â has always been the key role played by micron-size condensates, called Ã¢Â€ÂœdustÃ¢Â€Â or Ã¢Â€Âœclouds,Ã¢Â€Â in their atmosphere. This scenario, however, faces major problems, in particular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L to T transition, and a physical first-principle understanding of this transition is lacking. In this Letter, we propose a new, completely different explanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution, without the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the CO/CH 4 and N 2 /NH 3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and EGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature to the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and at the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy transport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the observed increase in near-infrared J Ã¢Â€Â“ H and J Ã¢Â€Â“ K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs, while a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the CO/CH 4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles, and provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition. This new picture leads to a drastic revision of our understanding of BD and EGP atmospheres and their evolution.}

abstract ={Spectroscopic observations of exoplanets are leading to unprecedented constraints on their atmospheric compositions. However, molecular abundances derived from spectra are degenerate with the absorption cross-sections which form critical input data in atmospheric models. Therefore, it is important to quantify the uncertainties in molecular cross-sections to reliably estimate the uncertainties in derived molecular abundances. However, converting line lists into cross-sections via line broadening involves a series of prescriptions for which the uncertainties are not well understood. We investigate and quantify the effects of various factors involved in line broadening in exoplanetary atmospheres Ã¢Â€Â“ the profile evaluation width, pressure versus thermal broadening, broadening agent, spectral resolution and completeness of broadening parameters Ã¢Â€Â“ on molecular absorption cross-sections. We use H2O as a case study as it has the most complete absorption line data. For low-resolution spectra (R Ã¢Â‰Â² 100) for representative temperatures and pressures (T Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼ 500Ã¢Â€Â“3000 K, P Ã¢Â‰Â² 1 atm) of H2-rich exoplanetary atmospheres, we find the median difference in cross-sections (ÃŽÂ´) introduced by various aspects of pressure broadening to be Ã¢Â‰Â²1 per cent. For medium resolutions (R Ã¢Â‰Â² 5000), including those attainable with James Webb Space Telescope, we find that ÃŽÂ´ can be up to 40 per cent. For high resolutions (R Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼ 105), ÃŽÂ´ can be Ã¢Â‰Â³100 per cent, reaching Ã¢Â‰Â³1000 per cent for low temperatures (T Ã¢Â‰Â² 500 K) and high pressures (P Ã¢Â‰Â³ 1 atm). The effect is higher still for self-broadening. We generate a homogeneous data base of absorption cross-sections of molecules of relevance to exoplanetary atmospheres for which high-temperature line lists are available, particularly H2O, CO, CH4, CO2, HCN, and NH3.},

   that planetesimals-the building blocks of planets-are produced within
   the first million years of a star's life(3). Fully formed planets are
   frequently detected on short orbital periods around mature stars. Some
   theories suggest that the in situ formation of planets close to their
   host stars is unlikely and that the existence of such planets is

   period of 5.4 days. The planet is 50 per cent larger than Neptune, and
   its mass is less than 3.6 times that of Jupiter (at 99.7 per cent

Abstract = {{The origin and evolution of planetary protoatmospheres in relation to
   the protoplanetary disk is discussed. The initial atmospheres of planets
   can mainly be related via two formation scenarios. If a protoplanetary
   core accretes mass and grows inside the gas disk, it can capture H-2, He
   and other gases from the disk. When the gas of the disk evaporates, the
   core that is surrounded by the H-2/He gas envelope is exposed to the
   high X-ray and extreme ultraviolet flux and stellar wind of the young
   host star. This period can be considered as the onset of atmospheric
   escape. It is shown that lower mass bodies accrete less gas and
   depending on the host stars radiation environment can therefore lose the
   gaseous envelope after tens or hundreds of million years. Massive cores
   may never get rid of their captured hydrogen envelopes and remain as
   sub-Neptunes, Neptunes or gas giants for their whole life time.
   Terrestrial planets which may have lost the captured gas envelope by
   thermal atmospheric escape, or which accreted after the protoplanetary
   nebula vanished will produce catastrophically outgassed steam
   atmospheres during the magma ocean solidification process. These steam
   atmospheres consist mainly of water and CO2 that was incorporated into
   the protoplanet during its accretion. Planets, which are formed in the
   habitable zone, solidify within several million years. In such cases the
   outgassed steam atmospheres cool fast, which leads to the condensation
   of water and the formation of liquid oceans. On the other hand, magma
   oceans are sustained for longer if planets form inside a critical
   distance, even if they outgassed a larger initial amount of water. In
   such cases the steam atmosphere could remain 100 million years or for
   even longer. Hydrodynamic atmospheric escape will then desiccate these
   planets during the slow solidification process.}},

Title = {{New chemical scheme for studying carbon-rich exoplanet atmospheres}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {577},
Abstract = {Context. While the existence of more than 1800 exoplanets have been
   confirmed, there is evidence of a wide variety of elemental chemical
   composition, that is to say different metallicities and C/N/O/H ratios.
   Atmospheres with a high C/O ratio (above 1) are expected to contain a
   high quantity of hydrocarbons, including heavy molecules (with more than
   two carbon atoms). To correctly study these C-rich atmospheres, a
   chemical scheme adapted to this composition is necessary.
   Aims. We have implemented a chemical scheme that can describe the
   kinetics of species with up to six carbon atoms (C-0-C-6 scheme). This
   chemical scheme has been developed with combustion specialists and
   validated by experiments that were conducted on a wide range of
   temperatures (300-2500 K) and pressures (0.01-100 bar).
   Methods. To determine for which type of studies this enhanced chemical
   scheme is mandatory, we created a grid of 12 models to explore different
   thermal profiles and C/O ratios. For each of them, we compared the
   chemical composition determined with a C-0-C-2 chemical scheme (species
   with up to two carbon atoms) and with the C-0-C-6 scheme. We also
   computed synthetic spectra corresponding to these 12 models.
   Results. We found no difference in the results obtained with the two
   schemes when photolyses were excluded from the model, regardless of the
   temperature of the atmosphere. In contrast, differences can appear in
   the upper atmosphere (P >similar to 1-10 mbar) when there is
   photochemistry. These differences are found for all the tested
   pressure-temperature profiles if the C/O ratio is above 1. When the C/O
   ratio of the atmosphere is solar, differences are only found at
   temperatures lower than 1000 K. The differences linked to the use of
   different chemical schemes have no strong influence on the synthetic
   spectra. However, with this study, we have confirmed C2H2 and HCN as
   possible tracers of warm C-rich atmospheres.
   Conclusions. The use of this new chemical scheme (instead of the
   C-0-C-2) is mandatory for modelling atmospheres with a high C/O ratio
   and, in particular, for studying the photochemistry in detail. If the
   focus is on the synthetic spectra, a smaller scheme may be sufficient,
   because it will be faster in terms of computation time.},

Title = {Simultaneous detection of water, methane, and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of exoplanet {HR~8799~b}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {804},
Abstract = {Absorption lines from water, methane, and carbon monoxide are detected
   in the atmosphere of exoplanet HR 8799 b. A medium-resolution spectrum
   presented here shows well-resolved and easily identified spectral
   features from all three molecules across the K band. The majority of the
   lines are produced by CO and H2O, but several lines clearly belong to
   CH4. Comparisons between these data and atmosphere models covering a
   range of temperatures and gravities yield log mole fractions of H2O
   between -3.09 and -3.91, CO between -3.30 and -3.72, and CH4 between
   -5.06 and -5.85. More precise mole fractions are obtained for each
   temperature and gravity studied. A reanalysis of H-band data, previously
   obtained at a similar spectral resolution, results in a nearly identical
   water abundance as determined from the K-band spectrum. The methane
   abundance is shown to be sensitive to vertical mixing and indicates an
   eddy diffusion coefficient in the range of 10(6)-10(8) cm(2) s(-1),
   comparable to mixing in the deep troposphere of Jupiter. The model
   comparisons also indicate a carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) between similar
   to 0.58 and 0.7, encompassing previous estimates for a second planet in
   the same system, HR 8799 c. Super-stellar C/O could indicate planet
   formation by core-accretion;. however, the range of possible C/O for
   these planets (and the star) is currently too large to comment strongly
   on planet formation. More precise values of the bulk properties (e.g.,
   effective temperature and surface gravity) are needed for improved
   abundance estimates.},

Title = {THE TRANSIT TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM OF A COLD GAS GIANT PLANET},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {814},
Abstract = {We use solar occultations observed by the Visual and Infrared Mapping
   Spectrometer on board the Cassini Spacecraft to extract the 1-5 $\mu$m
   transmission spectrum of Saturn, as if it were a transiting exoplanet.
   We detect absorption from methane, ethane, acetylene, aliphatic
   hydrocarbons, and possibly carbon monoxide, with peak-to-peak features
   of up to 90 parts-per-million despite the presence of ammonia clouds. We
   also find that atmospheric refraction, as opposed to clouds or haze,
   determines the minimum altitude that could be probed during mid-transit.
   Self-consistent exoplanet atmosphere models show good agreement with
   Saturn's transmission spectrum but fail to reproduce a large absorption
   feature near 3.4 $\mu$m, likely caused by gaseous ethane and a C-H
   stretching mode of an unknown aliphatic hydrocarbon. This large feature
   is located in one of the Spitzer Space Telescope bandpasses and could
   alter interpretations of transmission spectra if not properly modeled.
   The large signal in Saturn's transmission spectrum suggests that
   transmission spectroscopy of cold, long-period gaseous exoplanets should
   be possible with current and future observatories. Motivated by these
   results, we briefly consider the feasibility of. using a survey to
   search for and characterize cold exoplanets that are analogous to
   Jupiter and Saturn utilizing a target-of-opportunity approach.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{814}},
Abstract = {{Detailed characterization of exoplanets has begun to yield measurements
   of their atmospheric properties that constrain the planets' origins and
   evolution. For example, past observations of the dayside emission
   spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b indicated that its atmosphere has a
   high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O > 1), suggesting it had a different
   formation pathway than is commonly assumed for giant planets. Here we
   report a precise near-infrared transmission spectrum for WASP-12b based
   on six transit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field
   Camera 3. We bin the data in 13 spectrophotometric light curves from
   0.84 to 1.67 mu m and measure the transit depths to a median precision
   of 51 ppm. We retrieve the atmospheric properties using the transmission
   spectrum and find strong evidence for water absorption (7 sigma
   confidence). This detection marks the first high-confidence,
   spectroscopic identification of a molecule in the atmosphere of
   WASP-12b. The retrieved 1 sigma water volume mixing ratio is between
   10(-5) and 10(-2), which is consistent with C/O > 1 to within 2 sigma.
   However, we also introduce a new retrieval parameterization that fits
   for C/O and metallicity under the assumption of chemical equilibrium.
   With this approach, we constrain C/O to 0.5(-0.3)(+0.2) at 1 sigma and
   rule out a carbon-rich atmosphere composition (C/O > 1) at > 3 sigma
   confidence. Further observations and modeling of the planet's global
   thermal structure and dynamics would aid in resolving the tension
   between our inferred C/O and previous constraints. Our findings
   highlight the importance of obtaining high-precision data with multiple
   observing techniques in order to obtain robust constraints on the
   chemistry and physics of exoplanet atmospheres.}},

Title = {MODEL ATMOSPHERES OF IRRADIATED EXOPLANETS: THE INFLUENCE OF STELLAR
   PARAMETERS, METALLICITY, AND THE C/O RATIO},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2015},
Volume = {813},
Abstract = {Many parameters constraining the spectral appearance of exoplanets are
   still poorly understood. We therefore study the properties of irradiated
   exoplanet atmospheres over a wide parameter range including metallicity,
   C/O ratio, and host spectral type. We calculate a grid of 1D
   radiative-convective atmospheres and emission spectra. We perform the
   calculations with our new Pressure-Temperature Iterator and Spectral
   Emission Calculator for Planetary Atmospheres (PETIT) code, assuming
   chemical equilibrium. The atmospheric structures and spectra are made
   available online. We find that atmospheres of planets with C/O ratios
   similar to 1 and T-eff greater than or similar to 1500 K can exhibit
   inversions due to heating by the alkalis because the main coolants CH4,
   H2O, and HCN are depleted. Therefore, temperature inversions possibly
   occur without the presence of additional absorbers like TiO and VO. At
   low temperatures we find that the pressure level of the photosphere
   strongly influences whether the atmospheric opacity is dominated by
   either water (for low C/O) or methane (for high C/O), or both
   (regardless of the C/O). For hot, carbon-rich objects this pressure
   level governs whether the atmosphere is dominated by methane or HCN.
   Further we find that host stars of late spectral type lead to planetary
   atmospheres which have shallower, more isothermal temperature profiles.
   In agreement with prior work we find that for planets with T-eff < 1750
   K the transition between water or methane dominated spectra occurs at
   C/O similar to 0.7, instead of similar to 1, because condensation
   preferentially removes oxygen.},

abstract = {AbstractThe detection and atmospheric characterization of super-Earths is one of the major frontiers of exoplanetary science. Currently, extensive efforts are underway to detect molecules, particularly H2O, in super-Earth atmospheres. In the present work, we develop a systematic set of strategies to identify and observe potentially H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. First, we provide analytic prescriptions and discuss factors that need to be taken into account while planning and interpreting observations of super-Earth radii and spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses constrain different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and temperature of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the chemical composition and thermal profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses can induce biases in the" # " interpretation of the interior compositions. Second, we investigate the detectability of H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectrograph as a function of the planetary properties and stellar brightness. We find that highly irradiated super-Earths orbiting bright stars, such as 55 Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization compared to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars. Besides being better candidates for both transmission and emission spectroscopy, hotter planets offer higher likelihood of cloud-free atmospheres which aid tremendously in the observation and interpretation of spectra. Finally, we present case studies of two super-Earths, GJ 1214b and 55 Cancri e, using available data and models of their interiors and atmospheres.},

Title = {{THE ATMOSPHERES OF EARTHLIKE PLANETS AFTER GIANT IMPACT EVENTS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{784}},
Abstract = {{It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally
   involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well-known
   example. In the aftermath of such collisions, the surface of the
   surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore
   the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of
   post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres
   consisting predominantly of CO2 and H2O. The atmospheric chemistry and
   structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium
   with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate
   Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere, and oceans) or
   Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic
   opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that
   these atmospheres are dominated by H2O and CO2, while the formation of
   CH4 and NH3 is quenched because of short dynamical timescales. Other
   important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO2. These are apparent in
   the emerging spectra and can be indicative that an impact has occurred.
   The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor
   of two lower brightness temperature in the spectral windows than
   predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the
   hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared
   coronagraphs on the planned 30m class telescopes. The 1-4 mu m will be
   most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better
   contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive
   cooling timescales on the order of 10(5-6) yr on the basis of the
   modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of
   discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.}},

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{561}},
Abstract = {{Context. The observation of carbon-rich disks have motivated several
   studies questioning the influence of the C/O ratio on their gas phase
   composition in order to establish the connection between the metallicity
   of hot-Jupiters and that of their parent stars.
   Aims. We propose a method that allows the characterization of the
   adopted C/O ratio in protoplanetary disks independently from the
   determination of the host star composition. Titanium and vanadium
   chemistries are investigated because they are strong optical absorbers
   and also because their oxides are known to be sensitive to the C/O ratio
   in some exoplanet atmospheres.
   Methods. We use a commercial package based on the Gibbs energy
   minimization technique to compute the titanium and vanadium equilibrium
   chemistries in protoplanetary disks for C/O ratios ranging from 0.05 to
   10. Our calculations are performed for pressures in the 10(-6)-10(-2)
   bar domain, and for temperatures ranging from 50 K to 2000 K.
   Results. We find that the vanadium nitride/vanadium oxide and titanium
   hydride/titanium oxide gas phase ratios strongly depend on the C/O ratio
   in the hot parts of disks (T >= 1000 K). Our calculations suggest that,
   in these regions, these ratios can be used as tracers of the C/O value
   in protoplanetary disks.}},

Title = {{Carbon monoxide and water vapor in the atmosphere of the non-transiting
   exoplanet HD 179949 b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{565}},
Abstract = {{Context. In recent years, ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has
   become a powerful tool for investigating exoplanet atmospheres. It
   allows the robust identification of molecular species, and it can be
   applied to both transiting and non-transiting planets. Radial-velocity
   measurements of the star HD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant
   planet companion in a close-in orbit. The system is bright enough to be
   an ideal target for near-infrared, high-resolution spectroscopy.
   Aims. Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3 mu m,
   obtained at a resolution of R similar to 100 000, during three nights of
   observations with CRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the
   exoplanet was near superior conjunction, aiming to detect the planet's
   thermal spectrum and the radial component of its orbital velocity.
   Methods. Unlike the telluric signal, the planet signal is subject to a
   changing Doppler shift during the observations. This is due to the
   changing radial component of the planet orbital velocity, which is on
   the order of 100-150 km s(-1) for these hot Jupiters. We can therefore
   effectively remove the telluric absorption while preserving the planet
   signal, which is then extracted from the data by cross correlation with
   a range of model spectra for the planet atmosphere.
   Results. We detect molecular absorption from carbon monoxide and water
   vapor with a combined signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 6.3, at a projected
   planet orbital velocity of K-P = (142.8 +/- 3.4) km s(-1), which
   translates into a planet mass of M-P = (0.98 +/- 0.04) Jupiter masses,
   and an orbital inclination of i = (67.7 +/- 4.3) degrees, using the
   known stellar radial velocity and stellar mass. The detection of
   absorption features rather than emission means that, despite being
   highly irradiated, HD 179949 b does not have an atmospheric temperature
   inversion in the probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since the
   host star is active (R-HK' > -4.9), this is in line with the hypothesis
   that stellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion layers owing
   to UV flux photo-dissociating high-altitude, optical absorbers. Finally,
   our analysis favors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD 179949 b, although
   a carbon-rich planet cannot be statistically ruled out based on these
   data alone.}},

   molecules in the atmosphere of the exoplanet.
   Aims. We aim to identify new ways of increasing the planet signal in

   determine what wavelength settings can best be used to target certain
   molecules. Furthermore, we want to simulate exoplanet spectra of the

   feasible at high spectral resolution.
   Methods. We performed simulations of high-resolution CRIRES observations
   of a planet's thermal emission and transit between 1 and 5 mu m and
   performed a cross-correlation analysis on these results to assess how
   well the planet signal can be extracted. These simulations take into

   a HD 209458b test case}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{561}},
Abstract = {{We are adapting the global circulation model (GCM) of the UK Met Office,
   the so-called unified model (UM), for the study of hot Jupiters. In this
   work we demonstrate the successful adaptation of the most sophisticated
   dynamical core, the component of the GCM which solves the equations of
   motion for the atmosphere, available within the UM, ENDGame (Even Newer
   Dynamics for General atmospheric modelling of the environment). Within
   the same numerical scheme ENDGame supports solution to the dynamical
   equations under varying degrees of simplification. We present results
   from a simple, shallow (in atmospheric domain) hot Jupiter model (SHJ),
   and a more realistic (with a deeper atmosphere) HD209458b test case. For
   both test cases we find that the large-scale, time-averaged (over the
   1200 days prescribed test period), dynamical state of the atmosphere is
   relatively insensitive to the level of simplification of the dynamical
   equations. However, problems exist when attempting to reproduce the
   results for these test cases derived from other models. For the SHJ case
   the lower (and upper) boundary intersects the dominant dynamical
   features of the atmosphere meaning the results are heavily dependent on
   the boundary conditions. For the HD209458b test case, when using the
   more complete dynamical models, the atmosphere is still clearly evolving
   after 1200 days, and in a transient state. Solving the complete (deep
   atmosphere and non-hydrostatic) dynamical equations allows exchange
   between the vertical and horizontal momentum of the atmosphere, via
   Coriolis and metric terms. Subsequently, interaction between the upper
   atmosphere and the deeper more slowly evolving (radiatively inactive)
   atmosphere significantly alters the results, and acts over timescales
   longer than 1200 days.}},

Title = {{Constraining physics of very hot super-Earths with the James Webb
   Telescope. The case of CoRot-7b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{563}},
Abstract = {{Context. Transit detection from space using ultra-precise photometry led
   to the first detection of super-Earths with solid surfaces: CoRot-7b and
   Kepler-10b. Because they lie only a few stellar radii from their host
   stars, these two rocky planets are expected to be extremely hot.
   Aims. Assuming that these planets are in a synchronous rotation state
   and receive strong stellar winds and fluxes, previous studies have
   suggested that they must be atmosphere-free and that a lava ocean is
   present on their hot dayside. In this article, we use several dedicated
   thermal models of the irradiated planet to study how observations with
   NIRSPEC on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could further confirm
   and constrain, or reject the atmosphere-free lava ocean planet model for
   very hot super-Earths.
   Methods. Using CoRoT-7b as a working case, we explore the consequences
   on the phase-curve of a non tidal-locked rotation, with the
   presence/absence of an atmosphere, and for different values of the
   surface albedo. We then simulate future observations of the reflected
   light and thermal emission from CoRoT-7b with NIRSPEC-JWST and look for
   detectable signatures, such as time lag, of those peculiarities. We also
   study the possibility to retrieve the latitudinal surface temperature
   distribution from the observed SED.
   Results. We demonstrate that we should be able to constrain several
   parameters after observations of two orbits (42 h) thanks to the broad
   range of wavelengths accessible with JWST: i) the Bond albedo is
   retrieved to within +/- 0.03 in most cases. ii) The lag effect allows us
   to retrieve the rotation period within 3 h of a non phase-locked planet,
   whose rotation would be half the orbital period; for longer period, the
   accuracy is reduced. iii) Any spin period shorter than a limit in the
   range 30-800 h, depending on the thickness of the thermal layer in the
   soil, would be detected. iv) The presence of a thick gray atmosphere
   with a pressure of one bar, and a specific opacity higher than 10(-5)
   m(-2) kg(-1) is detectable. v) With spectra up to 4.5 mu m, the
   latitudinal temperature profile can be retrieved to within 30 K with a
   risk of a totally wrong solution in 5\% of the cases. This last result
   is obtained for a signal-to-noise ratio around 5 per resel, which should
   be reached on Corot-7 after a total exposure time of similar to 70 h
   with NIRSPEC and only three hours on a V = 8 star.
   Conclusions. We conclude that it should thus be possible to distinguish
   the reference situation of a lava ocean with phase-locking and no
   atmosphere from other cases. In addition, obtaining the surface
   temperature map and the albedo brings important constraints on the
   nature or the physical state of the soil of hot super-Earths.}},

  abstract={The Kepler-186 system consists of five planets orbiting an early M dwarf. The planets have physical radii of1.0-1.50Ã‚Â R Ã¢ÂŠÂ• and orbital periods of 4-130Ã‚Â days. The 1.1 R Ã¢ÂŠÂ• Kepler-186f with a period of 130Ã‚Â days is of particular interest. Its insolation of roughly0.32Ã‚Â S Ã¢ÂŠÂ• places it within the surface liquid water habitable zone (HZ). We present a multifaceted study of the Kepler-186 system, using two sets of parameters which are consistent with the data and also self-consistent. First, we show that the distribution of planet masses can be roughly reproduced if the planets were accreted from a high surface density disk presumably sculpted by an earlier phase of migration. However, our simulations predict the existence of one to two undetected planets between planets e andÃ‚Â f. Next, we present a dynamical analysis of the system including the effect of tides. The timescale for tidal evolution is short enough that the four inner planets must have small obliquities and near-synchronous rotation rates. The tidal evolution of Kepler-186f is slow enough that its current spin state depends on a combination of its initial spin state, its dissipation rate, and the stellar age. Finally, we study the habitability of Kepler-186f with a one-dimensional climate model. The planet's surface temperature can be raised above 273Ã‚Â K with 0.5-5 bars of CO 2 , depending on the amount of N 2 present. Kepler-186f represents a case study of an Earth-sized planet in the cooler regions of the HZ of a cool star.}

  abstract={We present here new transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HD-189733b using the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We obtained two nights of observations where we recorded the primary transit of the planet in the J , H , and K bands simultaneously, covering a spectral range from 0.94 to 2.42 ÃŽÂ¼m. We used Fourier analysis and other detrending techniques validated previously on other data sets to clean the data. We tested the statistical significance of our results by calculating the autocorrelation function, and we found that, after the detrending, autocorrelative noise is diminished at most frequencies. Additionally, we repeated our analysis on the out-of-transit data only, showing that the residual telluric contamination is well within the error bars. While these techniques are very efficient when multiple nights of observations are combined together, our results prove that even one good night of observations is enough to provide statistically meaningful data. Our observed spectra are consistent with space-based data recorded in the same wavelength interval by multiple instruments, indicating that ground-based facilities are becoming a viable and complementary option to spaceborne observatories. The best fit to the features in our data was obtained with water vapor. Our error bars are not small enough to address the presence of additional molecules; however, by combining the information contained in other data sets with our results, it is possible to explain all the available observations with a modeled atmospheric spectrum containing water vapor, methane, carbon monoxide, and hazes/clouds.}

Title = {PHOTOCHEMISTRY IN TERRESTRIAL EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES. III. PHOTOCHEMISTRY
   AND THERMOCHEMISTRY IN THICK ATMOSPHERES ON SUPER EARTHS AND MINI
   NEPTUNES},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2014},
Volume = {784},
Abstract = {Some super Earths and mini Neptunes will likely have thick atmospheres
   that are not H-2-dominated. We have developed a
   photochemistry-thermochemistry kinetic-transport model for exploring the
   compositions of thick atmospheres on super Earths and mini Neptunes,
   applicable for both H-2-dominated atmospheres and non-H-2-dominated
   atmospheres. Using this model to study thick atmospheres for wide ranges
   of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into
   hydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich
   atmospheres, and hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find that carbon has
   to be in the form of CO2 rather than CH4 or CO in a H-2-depleted
   water-dominated thick atmosphere and that the preferred loss of light
   elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich atmosphere leads to the
   formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We apply our
   self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnostic
   features for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ 1214 b, HD97658 b,
   and 55 Cnc e. For GJ 1214 b, we find that (1) C2H2 features at 1.0 and
   1.5 $\mu$m in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 $\mu$m in
   thermal emission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a
   detection of water-vapor features and a confirmation of the nonexistence
   of methane features would provide sufficient evidence for a
   water-dominated atmosphere. In general, our simulations show that
   chemical stability has to be taken into account when interpreting the
   spectrum of a super Earth/mini Neptune. Water-dominated atmospheres only
   exist for carbon to oxygen ratios much lower than the solar ratio,
   suggesting that this kind of atmospheres could be rare.},

  title={The Atmospheres of Earthlike Planets after Giant Impact Events},
  journal= ApJ,
  volume={784},
  pages={27},
  year={2014},
  abstract={It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well-known example. In the aftermath of such collisions, the surface of the surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO 2 and H 2 O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere, and oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that these atmospheres are dominated by H 2 O and CO 2 , while the formation of CH 4 and NH 3 is quenched because of short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO 2 . These are apparent in the emerging spectra and can be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor of two lower brightness temperature in the spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30 m class telescopes. The 1-4 ÃŽÂ¼m will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive cooling timescales on the order of 10 5-6Ã‚Â yr on the basis of the modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.}

Journal = ApJ,

Abstract = {{We report near-infrared spectroscopy of the gas giant planet HD 189733b
   in transit. We used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (IIST
   WFC3) with its G141 grism covering 1.1 mu m to 1.7 mu m and spatially
   scanned the image across the detector at 2 `' s(-1). When smoothed to 75
   nm bins, the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15 mu m and 1.4
   mu m water vapor features are, respectively, 83 +/- 53 ppm and 200 +/-
   47 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 mu m. We compare the WFC3
   spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD 189733b assembled by
   Pont et al., extending from 0.3 mu m to 24 mu m. Although the water
   vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the model of
   non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere, we
   also re-interpret the available data with a clear planetary atmosphere.
   In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing transit depth with
   shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the visible, and
   into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a smaller
   contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the
   planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our
   model planetary atmosphere's temperature is similar to 700 K, which is
   below the condensation temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing
   molecules, causing the broad wings of the spectral lines of Na I and K I
   at 0.589 mu m and 0.769 mu m to be weak.}},

Title = {A STUDY OF THE SHORTEST-PERIOD PLANETS FOUND WITH {K}EPLER},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{787}},
Abstract = {{We present the results of a survey aimed at discovering and studying
   transiting planets with orbital periods shorter than one day
   (ultra-short-period, or USP, planets), using data from the Kepler
   spacecraft. We computed Fourier transforms of the photometric time
   series for all 200,000 target stars, and detected transit signals based
   on the presence of regularly spaced sharp peaks in the Fourier spectrum.
   We present a list of 106 USP candidates, of which 18 have not previously
   been described in the literature. This list of candidates increases the
   number of planet candidates with orbital periods shorter than about six
   hours from two to seven. In addition, among the objects we studied,
   there are 26 USP candidates that had been previously reported in the
   literature which do not pass our various tests. All 106 of our
   candidates have passed several standard tests to rule out false
   positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false positive rate is
   also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for which
   more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these
   multi-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are
   able to infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other
   planets with periods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot
   Jupiters which very rarely have companions in that same period range.
   Another clear pattern is that almost all USP planets are smaller than 2
   R., possibly because gas giants in very tight orbits would lose their
   atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject to extremely strong stellar
   irradiation. Based on our survey statistics, USP planets exist around
   approximately (0.51 +/- 0.07)\% of G-dwarf stars, and (0.83 +/- 0.18)\%
   of K-dwarf stars.}},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{147}},
Abstract = {{Since the first report of a potentially non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio
   (C/O) in its dayside atmosphere, the highly irradiated exoplanet
   WASP-12b has been under intense scrutiny and the subject of many
   follow-up observations. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar
   binary companions similar to 1{''} from WASP-12 has obfuscated
   interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new
   ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of
   WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical
   with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's
   stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H-2
   atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the
   transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as
   TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH)
   for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy
   observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband transit photometry
   from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3
   data to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere,
   respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the
   models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical
   significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis ofWASP-12b
   suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple
   Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870
   +/- 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated
   spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place
   definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.}},

   previous study by Grillmair et al. that did not examine all data sets

abstract ={Understanding a planetÃ¢Â€Â™s atmosphere is a necessary condition for understanding not only the planet itself, but also its formation, structure, evolution, and habitability. This requirement puts a premium on obtaining spectra and developing credible interpretative tools with which to retrieve vital planetary information. However, for exoplanets, these twin goals are far from being realized. In this paper, I provide a personal perspective on exoplanet theory and remote sensing via photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy. Although not a review in any sense, this paper highlights the limitations in our knowledge of compositions, thermal profiles, and the effects of stellar irradiation, focusing on, but not restricted to, transiting giant planets. I suggest that the true function of the recent past of exoplanet atmospheric research has been not to constrain planet properties for all time, but to train a new generation of scientists who, by rapid trial and error, are fast establishing a solid future foundation for a robust science of exoplanets.},

nights of observations where we recorded the primary transit of the planet
in the J, H, and K bands simultaneously, covering a spectral range from 0.94
to 2.42 ÃŽÂ¼m. We used Fourier analysis and other detrending techniques validated
previously on other data sets to clean the data. We tested the statistical
significance of our results by calculating the autocorrelation function, and we
found that, after the detrending, autocorrelative noise is diminished at most
frequencies. Additionally, we repeated our analysis on the out-of-transit data only,
showing that the residual telluric contamination is well within the error bars.
While these techniques are very efficient when multiple nights of observations
are combined together, our results prove that even one good night of observations
is enough to provide statistically meaningful data. Our observed spectra are
consistent with space-based data recorded in the same wavelength interval by multiple
instruments, indicating that ground-based facilities are becoming a viable and
complementary option to spaceborne observatories. The best fit to the features
in our data was obtained with water vapor. Our error bars are not small enough
to address the presence of additional molecules; however, by combining the
information contained in other data sets with our results, it is possible to
explain all the available observations with a modeled atmospheric spectrum
containing water vapor, methane, carbon monoxide, and hazes/clouds.},

Abstract = {{We compare five general circulation models (GCMs) which have been
   recently used to study hot extrasolar planet atmospheres (BOB, CAM,
   IGCM, MITgcm, and PEQMOD), under three test cases useful for assessing
   model convergence and accuracy. Such a broad, detailed intercomparison
   has not been performed thus far for extrasolar planets study. The models
   considered all solve the traditional primitive equations, but employ
   different numerical algorithms or grids (e.g., pseudospectral and finite
   volume, with the latter separately in longitude-latitude and
   `cubed-sphere' grids). The test cases are chosen to cleanly address
   specific aspects of the behaviors typically reported in hot extrasolar
   planet simulations: (I) steady-state, (2) nonlinearly evolving
   baroclinic wave, and (3) response to fast timescale thermal relaxation.
   When initialized with a steady jet, all models maintain the steadiness,
   as they should except MITgcm in cubed-sphere grid. A very good agreement
   is obtained for a baroclinic wave evolving from an initial instability
   in pseudospectral models (only). However, exact numerical convergence is
   still not achieved across the pseudospectral models: amplitudes and
   phases are observably different. When subject to a typical
   `hot-Jupiter'-like forcing, all five models show quantitatively
   different behavior although qualitatively similar, time-variable,
   quadrupole-dominated flows are produced. Hence, as have been advocated
   in several past studies, specific quantitative predictions (such as the
   location of large vortices and hot regions) by GCMs should be viewed
   with caution. Overall, in the tests considered here, pseudospectral
   models in pressure coordinate (PEBOB and PEQMOD) perform the best and
   MITgcm in cubed-sphere grid performs the worst. }},

                  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with ICÃ¢Â‰Âˆ4Ã¢ÂˆÂ’13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the starÃ¢Â€Â™s ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2Ã‚Â min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30Ã‚Â min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

Abstract = {Ground-based high-dispersion spectroscopy could reveal molecular oxygen
   as a biomarker gas in the atmospheres of twin-Earths transiting red
   dwarf stars within the next 25 years. The required contrasts are only a
   factor of 3 lower than that already achieved for carbon monoxide in hot
   Jupiter atmospheres today but will need much larger telescopes because
   the target stars will be orders of magnitude fainter. If
   extraterrestrial life is very common and can therefore be found on
   planets around the most nearby red dwarf stars, it may be detectable via
   transmission spectroscopy with the next-generation extremely large
   telescopes. However, it is likely that significantly more collecting
   area is required for this. This can be achieved through the development
   of low-cost flux collector technology, which combines a large collecting
   area with a low but sufficient image quality for high-dispersion
   spectroscopy of bright stars.},

Title = {{Detection of carbon monoxide in the high-resolution day-side spectrum of
   the exoplanet HD 189733b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{554}},
Abstract = {{Context. After many attempts over more than a decade, high-resolution
   spectroscopy has recently delivered its first detections of molecular
   absorption in exoplanet atmospheres, both in transmission and thermal
   emission spectra. Targeting the combined signal from individual lines in
   molecular bands, these measurements use variations in the planet radial
   velocity to separate the planet signal from telluric and stellar
   contaminants.
   Aims. We apply high-resolution spectroscopy to probe molecular
   absorption in the day-side spectrum of the bright transiting hot Jupiter
   HD 189733b.
   Methods. We observed HD 189733b with the CRIRES high-resolution
   near-infrared spectograph on the Very Large Telescope during three
   nights, targeting possible absorption from carbon monoxide, water
   vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide, at 2.0 and 2.3 mu m.
   Results. We detect a 5-sigma absorption signal from CO at a contrast
   level of similar to 4.5 x 10(-4) with respect to the stellar continuum,
   revealing the planet orbital radial velocity at 154(-3)(+4) km s(-1).
   This allows us to solve for the planet and stellar mass in a similar way
   as for stellar eclipsing binaries, resulting in M-s =
   0.846(-0.049)(+0.068) M-circle dot and M-p = 1.162(-0.039)(+0.058)
   M-Jup. No significant absorption is detected from H2O, CO2, or CH4 and
   we determine upper limits on their line contrasts.
   Conclusions. The detection of CO in the day-side spectrum of HD 189733b
   can be made consistent with the haze layer proposed to explain the
   optical to near-infrared transmission spectrum if the layer is optically
   thin at the normal incidence angles probed by our observations, or if
   the CO abundance is high enough for the CO absorption to originate from
   above the haze. Our non-detection of CO2 at 2.0 mu m is not inconsistent
   with the deep CO2 absorption from low-resolution NICMOS secondary
   eclipse data in the same wavelength range. If genuine, the absorption
   would be so strong that it blanks out any planet light completely in
   this wavelength range, leaving no high-resolution signal to be measured.}},

We detect two periodic sets of transit signals in the 3-year flux time series of Kepler-69, obtained with the Kepler spacecraft. Using the very high precision Kepler photometry, and follow-up observations, our confidence that these signals represent planetary transits is >99.3%.

Assuming an Earth-like Bond albedo, Kepler-69c has an equilibrium temperature of 299 Ã‚Â± 19 K, which places the planet close to the habitable zone around the host star. This is the smallest planet found by Kepler to be orbiting in or near the habitable zone of a Sun-like star and represents an important step on the path to finding the first true Earth analog.}

	were performed with the MMIRS instrument on the Magellan II telescope
	using the technique of multi-object spectroscopy with wide slits.
	We compare the transmission and emission data to theoretical models
	to constrain the composition and thermal structure of the planet's
	atmosphere. Our measured transmission spectrum exhibits a scatter
	that corresponds to 1.3 scale heights of the planet's atmosphere,
	which is consistent with the size of spectral features predicted
	by theoretical models for a clear atmosphere. We detect the secondary
	eclipses of the planet at significances ranging from 2.2 sigma to
	14.4 sigma. The secondary eclipse depths, and the significances of
	the detections increase toward longer wavelengths. Our measured emission
	spectrum is consistent with a 2250 K effectively isothermal one-dimensional
	model for the planet's dayside atmosphere. This model also matches

	the important role that ground-based observations using multi-object
	spectroscopy can play in constraining the properties of exoplanet
	atmospheres, and they also emphasize the need for high-precision
	measurements based on observations of multiple transits and eclipses.},

  abstract={Sulfur gases are common components in the volcanic and biological emission on Earth, and are expected to be important input gases for atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets. We study the atmospheric composition and the spectra of terrestrial exoplanets with sulfur compounds (i.e., H 2 S and SO 2 ) emitted from their surfaces. We use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model and radiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheres ranging from reducing to oxidizing. The most important finding is that both H 2 S and SO 2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets, based on models of H 2 , N 2 , and CO 2 atmospheres. This implies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their surface emission rates need to be extremely high (>1000 times Earth's volcanic sulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also find that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical formation of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which would condense to form aerosols if saturated. For terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars or M stars, Earth-like sulfur emission rates result in optically thick haze composed of elemental sulfur in reducing H 2 -dominated atmospheres for a wide range of particle diameters (0.1-1 ÃŽÂ¼m), which is assumed as a free parameter in our simulations. In oxidized atmospheres composed of N 2 and CO 2 , optically thick haze, composed of elemental sulfur aerosols (S 8 ) or sulfuric acid aerosols (H 2 SO 4 ), will form if the surface sulfur emission is two orders of magnitude more than the volcanic sulfur emission of Earth. Although direct detection of H 2 S and SO 2 by their spectral features is unlikely, their emission might be inferred by observing aerosol-related features in reflected light with future generation space telescopes.}

  abstract={Neptune-sized extrasolar planets that orbit relatively close to their host stars often called ``hot Neptunes' are common within the known population of exoplanets and planetary candidates. Similar to our own Uranus and Neptune, inefficient accretion of nebular gas is expected produce hot Neptunes whose masses are dominated by elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. At high atmospheric metallicities of 10-10,000 times solar, hot Neptunes will exhibit an interesting continuum of atmospheric compositions, ranging from more Neptune-like, H 2 -dominated atmospheres to more Venus-like, CO 2 -dominated atmospheres. We explore the predicted equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry of generic hot Neptunes and find that the atmospheric composition varies strongly as a function of temperature and bulk atmospheric properties such as metallicity and the C/O ratio. Relatively exotic H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , and even O 2 -dominated atmospheres are possible for hot Neptunes. We apply our models to the case of GJ 436b, where we find that a CO-rich, CH 4 -poor atmosphere can be a natural consequence of a very high atmospheric metallicity. From comparisons of our results with Spitzer eclipse data for GJ 436b, we conclude that although the spectral fit from the high-metallicity forward models is not quite as good as the best fit obtained from pure retrieval methods, the atmospheric composition predicted by these forward models is more physically and chemically plausible in terms of the relative abundance of major constituents. High-metallicity atmospheres (orders of magnitude in excess of solar) should therefore be considered as a possibility for GJ 436b and other hot Neptunes.}

  journal= ApJ,

  year={2013},
  abstract={Biosignature gas detection is one of the ultimate future goals for exoplanet atmosphere studies. We have created a framework for linking biosignature gas detectability to biomass estimates, including atmospheric photochemistry and biological thermodynamics. The new framework is intended to liberate predictive atmosphere models from requiring fixed, Earth-like biosignature gas source fluxes. New biosignature gases can be considered with a check that the biomass estimate is physically plausible. We have validated the models on terrestrial production of NO, H 2 S, CH 4 , CH 3 Cl, and DMS. We have applied the models to propose NH 3 as a biosignature gas on a "cold Haber World," a planet with a N 2 -H 2 atmosphere, and to demonstrate why gases such as CH 3 Cl must have too large of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature gas on planets with Earth or early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a Sun-like star. To construct the biomass models, we developed a functional classification of biosignature gases, and found that gases (such as CH 4 , H 2 S, and N 2 O) produced from life that extracts energy from chemical potential energy gradients will always have false positives because geochemistry has the same gases to work with as life does, and gases (such as DMS and CH 3 Cl) produced for secondary metabolic reasons are far less likely to have false positives but because of their highly specialized origin are more likely to be produced in small quantities. The biomass model estimates are valid to one or two orders of magnitude; the goal is an independent approach to testing whether a biosignature gas is plausible rather than a precise quantification of atmospheric biosignature gases and their corresponding biomasses.}

We explore these properties motivated by two key questions: whether such planets could provide habitable conditions and whether they exhibit discernable spectral features that distinguish a water-planet from a rocky Earth-like planet. We show that the recently discovered planets Kepler-62 e and -62 f are the first viable candidates for habitable zone water-planets. We use these planets as test cases for discussing those differences in detail. We generate atmospheric spectral models and find that potentially habitable water-planets show a distinctive spectral fingerprint in transit depending on their position in the habitable zone.}

Abstract = {{The thermal evolution of magma oceans produced by collision with giant
   impactors late in accretion is expected to depend on the composition and
   structure of the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect of CO2 and H2O
   released from the magma during its crystallization. In order to
   constrain the various cooling timescales of the system, we developed a
   1-D parameterized convection model of a magma ocean coupled with a 1-D
   radiative-convective model of the atmosphere. We conducted a parametric
   study and described the influences of the initial volatile inventories,
   the initial depth of the magma ocean, and the Sun-planet distance. Our
   results suggest that a steam atmosphere delays the end of the magma
   ocean phase by typically 1 Myr. Water vapor condenses to an ocean after
   0.1, 1.5, and 10 Myr for, respectively, Mars, Earth, and Venus. This
   time would be virtually infinite for an Earth-sized planet located at
   less than 0.66 AU from the Sun. Using a more accurate calculation of
   opacities, we show that Venus is much closer to this threshold distance
   than in previous models. So there are conditions such as no water ocean
   is formed on Venus. Moreover, for Mars and Earth, water ocean formation
   timescales are shorter than typical time gaps between major impacts.
   This implies that successive water oceans may have developed during
   accretion, making easier the loss of their atmospheres by impact
   erosion. On the other hand, Venus could have remained in the magma ocean
   stage for most of its accretion.

   thermochemical gas-phase models are investigated. Results from
   drift-phoenix atmosphere simulations, which include the feedback of

   and the gas-phase abundances, are utilized. The resulting element
   depletion leads to a shift in the carbon-to-oxygen ratio such that
   several hydrocarbon molecules and cyanopolyyne molecules can be present.
   An increase in surface gravity and/or a decrease in metallicity support
   the increase in the partial pressures of these species. CO, CO2, CH4 and
   HCN contain the largest fraction of carbon. In the upper atmosphere of
   low-metallicity objects, more carbon is contained in C4H than in CO, and
   also CH3 and C2H2 play an increasingly important role as carbon sink. We
   determine chemical relaxation time-scales to evaluate if hydrocarbon
   molecules can be affected by transport-induced quenching. Our results
   suggest that a considerable amount of C2H6 and C2H2 could be expected in
   the upper atmospheres not only of giant gas planets, but also of brown

   absorption or emission from other carbon-bearing molecules, such as
   methane, although we do note a marginal increase in the significance of
   our detection to 5.1 sigma with the inclusion of carbon dioxide in our

   molecules like CO, but also to more complex molecules like H2O even in
   highly telluric contaminated regions of the Earth's transmission
   spectrum. It is a powerful tool that can be used for conducting an
   immediate census of the carbon-and oxygen-bearing molecules in the

   spectra cover a wavelength range of 0.29-1.03 mu m, with resolving power
   R = 500. The optical data are combined with archival near-infrared data
   from the HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G141 grism, covering the
   wavelength range from 1.087 to 1.687 mu m, with resolving power R = 130.
   We reach signal-to-noise levels between 3000 and 11 000 in 0.1 mu m bins
   when measuring the transmission spectra from 0.53-1.687 mu m. WASP-19 is
   known to be a very active star, with the optical stellar flux varying by
   a few per cent over time. We correct the transit light curves for the
   effects of stellar activity using ground-based activity monitoring with
   the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. While we were not able to
   construct a transmission spectrum using the blue optical data because of
   the presence of large occulted starspots, we were able to use the spot
   crossings to help constrain the mean stellar spot temperature. To search
   for predicted features in the hot-Jupiter atmosphere, in addition to the
   transmission spectrum we also define spectral indices for differential
   radius (delta R-P/R-star) measurements to specifically search for the
   presence of TiO and alkali line features. Our measurements rule out TiO
   features predicted for a planet of WASP-19b's equilibrium temperature
   (2050 K) in the transmission spectrum at the 2.7-2.9 Sigma confidence
   level, depending on atmospheric model formalism. The WFC3 transmission
   spectrum shows strong absorption features due to the presence of H2O,
   which is detected at the 4 Sigma confidence level between 1.1 and 1.4 mu
   m. The transmission spectra results indicate that WASP-19b is a planet
   with no or low levels of TiO and without a high C/O ratio. The lack of
   observable TiO features are possibly due to rainout, breakdown from
   stellar activity or the presence of other absorbers in the optical.}},

Abstract = {The hot Jupiter HD 189733b is the most extensively observed exoplanet.
   Its atmosphere has been detected and characterized in transmission and
   eclipse spectroscopy, and its phase curve measured at several
   wavelengths. This paper brings together the results of our campaign to
   obtain the complete transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of this
   planet from UV to infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope, using the
   STIS, ACS and WFC3 instruments. We provide a new tabulation of the
   transmission spectrum across the entire visible and infrared range. The
   radius ratio in each wavelength band was re-derived, where necessary, to
   ensure a consistent treatment of the bulk transit parameters and stellar
   limb darkening. Special care was taken to correct for, and derive
   realistic estimates of the uncertainties due to, both occulted and
   unocculted star spots.
   The combined spectrum is very different from the predictions of
   cloud-free models for hot Jupiters: it is dominated by Rayleigh
   scattering over the whole visible and near-infrared range, the only
   detected features being narrow sodium and potassium lines. We interpret
   this as the signature of a haze of condensate grains extending over at
   least five scaleheights. We show that a dust-dominated atmosphere could
   also explain several puzzling features of the emission spectrum and
   phase curves, including the large amplitude of the phase curve at 3.6 mu
   m, the small hotspot longitude shift and the hot mid-infrared emission
   spectrum. We discuss possible compositions and derive some first-order
   estimates for the properties of the putative condensate haze/clouds. We
   finish by speculating that the dichotomy between the two observationally
   defined classes of hot Jupiter atmospheres, of which HD 189733b and HD
   209458b are the prototypes, might not be whether they possess a
   temperature inversion, but whether they are clear or dusty. We also
   consider the possibility of a continuum of cloud properties between hot
   Jupiters, young Jupiters and L-type brown dwarfs.},

   extensive data set, we improve significantly the parameters of the
   system. Notably, the largely improved precision on the stellar density
   (2.41 +/- 0.08 rho(circle dot)) combined with constraining the age to be
   younger than a Hubble time allows us to break the degeneracy of the
   stellar solution mentioned in the discovery paper. The resulting stellar
   mass and size are 0.717 +/- 0.025 M-circle dot and 0.667 +/- 0.011
   R-circle dot. Our deduced physical parameters for the planet are 2.034
   +/- 0.052 M-Jup and 1.036 +/- 0.019 R-Jup. Taking into account its level
   of irradiation, the high density of the planet favors an old age and a
   massive core. Our deduced orbital eccentricity,
   0.0035(-0.0025)(+0.0060), is consistent with a fully circularized orbit.
   We detect the emission of the planet at 2.09 mu m at better than
   11-sigma, the deduced occultation depth being 1560 +/- 140 ppm. Our
   detection of the occultation at 1.19 mu m is marginal (790 +/- 320 ppm)
   and more observations are needed to confirm it. We place a 3-sigma upper
   limit of 850 ppm on the depth of the occultation at similar to 0.9 mu m.
   Together, these results strongly favor a poor redistribution of the heat
   to the night-side of the planet, and marginally favor a model with no

Several classes of models are ruled out, however, including hydrogen-rich atmospheres with no haze, hydrogen-rich atmospheres with a haze of ~0.01 ÃŽÂ¼m tholin particles, and hydrogen-poor atmospheres with major sources of absorption other than water. We propose an observational test to distinguish hydrogen-rich from hydrogen-poor atmospheres. Finally, we provide a library of theoretical transit spectra for super-Earths with a broad range of parameters to facilitate future comparison with anticipated data.}

  abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres
	have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental
	abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been
	made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar
	irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations
	from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical
	compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar
	abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization
	scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this
	work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important
	second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In
	hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences
	the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant
	species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4
	abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable
	atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become
	prominent for C/O >= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged.
	Furthermore, a C/O >= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due
	to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally
	underabundant for C/O >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification
	scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation
	(or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four
	classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical,
	thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations,
	we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters
	(XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in
	the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the
	data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich
	atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain
	their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions
	of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing
	and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary
	atmospheres.},

Abstract = {{Currently, there are about three dozen known super-Earths (M < 10
   M-circle plus), of which eight are transiting planets suitable for
   atmospheric follow-up observations. Some of the planets are exposed to
   extreme temperatures as they orbit close to their host stars, e. g.,
   CoRot-7b, and all of these planets have equilibrium temperatures
   significantly hotter than the Earth. Such planets can develop
   atmospheres through (partial) vaporization of their crustal and/or
   mantle silicates. We investigated the chemical equilibrium composition
   of such heated systems from 500 to 4000 K and total pressures from
   10(-6) to 10(+2) bars. The major gases are H2O and CO2 over broad
   temperature and pressure ranges, and Na, K, O-2, SiO, and O at high
   temperatures and low pressures. We discuss the differences in
   atmospheric composition arising from vaporization of SiO2-rich (i.e.,
   felsic) silicates (like Earth's continental crust) and MgO-, FeO-rich
   (i.e., mafic) silicates (like the bulk silicate Earth). The

   of the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the detection of infrared light from the super-Earth 55 Cnc

   Our data analysis consists of a two-part process. In a first step, we
   perform individual analyses of each data set and compare several
   baseline models to optimally account for the systematics affecting each
   light curve. We apply independent photometric correction techniques,
   including polynomial detrending and pixel mapping, that yield consistent
   results at the 1 sigma level. In a second step, we perform a global
   Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, including all four data sets that
   yield an occultation depth of 131 +/- 28 ppm, translating to a
   brightness temperature of 2360 +/- 300 K in the IRAC 4.5 mu m channel.
   This occultation depth suggests a low Bond albedo coupled to an
   inefficient heat transport from the planetary day side to the night
   side, or else possibly that the 4.5 mu m observations probe atmospheric
   layers that are hotter than the maximum equilibrium temperature (i.e., a
   thermal inversion layer or a deep hot layer). The measured occultation

The virial equation of state, truncated at the third virial coefficient, is employed to describe the fugacity coefficients of Si(OH)4. The temperature dependencies of the second, B12, and the third, C112, cross virial coefficients for H2OÃ¢Â€Â“Si(OH)4 interactions are approximated by empirical relations. It is found that silicaÃ¢Â€Â“water interactions in the vapor phase are significantly more non-ideal compared to waterÃ¢Â€Â“water interactions. Knowledge of \{B12\} and \{C112\} allows calculation of solubilities of quartz (Q) and amorphous silica (AS) in steam up to the density of 200 kg mÃ¢ÂˆÂ’3 in satisfactory agreement with available data, and should provide reasonable solubility values at temperatures where no experimental results exist. The calculated values of the solubility of Q and \{AS\} in saturated vapor up to the critical temperature of water, Tc, are tabulated. The partial molar properties of dilute solutes close to the critical point of water are governed by the Krichevskii parameter, the value of which for Si(OH)4 is evaluated from available data (mainly vaporÃ¢Â€Â“liquid distribution constants for silica) to be equal to Ã¢ÂˆÂ’187 Ã‚Â± 10 MPa. The knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of Si(OH)4 in the ideal gas state and in the state of the standard solution in liquid water allows calculating HenryÃ¢Â€Â™s constant, kH, for Si(OH)4 up to 623.15 K at water saturation pressure P 1 Ã¢ÂˆÂ— . The theoretically-based equation, containing the Krichevskii parameter, allows extrapolating kH values all the way toward the critical temperature of water. This, in turn, makes possible calculation of the solubility of quartz and amorphous silica in liquid water at P 1 Ã¢ÂˆÂ— at all temperatures up to Tc. The presented results should be useful for modeling solidÃ¢Â€Â“liquidÃ¢Â€Â“vapor, solidÃ¢Â€Â“vapor and liquidÃ¢Â€Â“vapor equilibria in the H2OÃ¢Â€Â“SiO2 system at steam densities up to 200 kg mÃ¢ÂˆÂ’3. }

Journal = MNRAS,

Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared transmission
   spectroscopy of the transiting exoplanet HD 189733b, using the Wide
   Field Camera 3 (WFC3). This consists of time series spectra of two
   transits, used to measure the wavelength dependence of the planetary
   radius. These observations aim to test whether the Rayleigh scattering
   haze detected at optical wavelengths extends into the near-infrared, or
   if it becomes transparent leaving molecular features to dominate the
   transmission spectrum. Due to saturation and non-linearity affecting the
   brightest (central) pixels of the spectrum, light curves were extracted
   from the blue and red ends of the spectra only, corresponding to
   wavelength ranges of 1.099-1.168 and 1.521-1.693 mu m, respectively, for
   the first visit, and 1.082-1.128 and 1.514-1.671 mu m for the second.
   The light curves were fitted using a Gaussian process model to account
   for instrumental systematics whilst simultaneously fitting for the
   transit parameters. This gives values of the planet-to-star radius ratio
   for the blue and red light curves of 0.156 50 +/- 0.000 48 and 0.156 34
   +/- 0.000 32, respectively, for visit 1 and 0.157 16 +/- 0.000 78 and
   0.156 30 +/- 0.000 37 for visit 2 (using a quadratic limb-darkening
   law). The planet-to-star radius ratios measured in both visits are
   consistent, and we see no evidence for the drop in absorption expected
   if the haze that is observed in the optical becomes transparent in the
   infrared. This tentatively suggests that the haze dominates the
   transmission spectrum of HD 189733b into near-infrared wavelengths,
   although more robust observations are required to provide conclusive
   evidence.},

Journal = MNRAS,

Volume = {419},
Pages = {2683-2694},
Abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring the
   wavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planets atmosphere
   during a transit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition.
   However, the expected signal is typically orders of magnitude smaller
   than instrumental systematics and the results are crucially dependent on
   the treatment of the latter. In this paper, we propose a new method to
   infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using
   Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning
   community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our
   method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the
   instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a
   specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters,
   and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an
   example application of the method to archival NICMOS transmission
   spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HD 189733, which goes some way towards
   reconciling the controversy surrounding this data set in the literature.
   Finally, we provide an appendix giving a general introduction to
   Gaussian processes for regression, in order to encourage their
   application to a wider range of problems.},

	the thermal structure and composition of an exoplanet by solving
	the inverse problem. The development of a suite of radiative transfer
	and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is described, building
	upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the study
	of our own Solar system. First, we discuss the plausibility of detection
	of different molecules in the dayside atmosphere of HD189733b and
	the best-fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets
	of secondary eclipse observations between 1.45 and 24 mu m. Additionally,
	we use contribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity
	of the emission spectrum to temperatures and molecular composition.
	Over the altitudes probed by the contribution functions, the retrieved
	thermal structure shows an isothermal upper atmosphere overlying
	a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature decreasing with altitude),
	which is consistent with previously reported dynamical and observational
	results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved parameters are estimated
	conservatively using an analysis of the cross-correlation functions

	formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the uncertainties
	on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous studies,

	a major milestone in our quest to understand our place in the universe
	by placing our Solar System in context and by addressing the suitability
	of planets for the presence of life. EChO-the Exoplanet Characterisation
	Observatory-is a mission concept specifically geared for this purpose.
	EChO will provide simultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations
	on a stable platform that will allow very long exposures. The use
	of passive cooling, few moving parts and well established technology
	gives a low-risk and potentially long-lived mission. EChO will build
	on observations by Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based telescopes, which
	discovered the first molecules and atoms in exoplanetary atmospheres.
	However, EChO's configuration and specifications are designed to
	study a number of systems in a consistent manner that will eliminate
	the ambiguities affecting prior observations. EChO will simultaneously
	observe a broad enough spectral region-from the visible to the mid-infrared-to
	constrain from one single spectrum the temperature structure of the
	atmosphere, the abundances of the major carbon and oxygen bearing
	species, the expected photochemically-produced species and magnetospheric
	signatures. The spectral range and resolution are tailored to separate
	bands belonging to up to 30 molecules and retrieve the composition
	and temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list
	for EChO includes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium
	temperatures T (eq) up to 2,000 K, to those of a few Earth masses,
	with T (eq) \textbackslash{}u223c 300 K. The list will include planets
	with no Solar System analog, such as the recently discovered planets
	GJ1214b, whose density lies between that of terrestrial and gaseous
	planets, or the rocky-iron planet 55 Cnc e, with day-side temperature
	close to 3,000 K. As the number of detected exoplanets is growing
	rapidly each year, and the mass and radius of those detected steadily
	decreases, the target list will be constantly adjusted to include
	the most interesting systems. We have baselined a dispersive spectrograph
	design covering continuously the 0.4-16 mu m spectral range in 6
	channels (1 in the visible, 5 in the InfraRed), which allows the
	spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,
	depending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted
	behind a 1.5 m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the
	instrument structure and optics passively cooled to \textbackslash{}u223c45
	K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit around L2. This orbit,
	in combination with an optimised thermal shield design, provides
	a highly stable thermal environment and a high degree of visibility
	of the sky to observe repeatedly several tens of targets over the
	year. Both the baseline and alternative designs have been evaluated
	and no critical items with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) less
	than 4-5 have been identified. We have also undertaken a first-order
	cost and development plan analysis and find that EChO is easily compatible
	with the ESA M-class mission framework.},

Abstract = {Context. We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter
   HD 189733b, obtained at 3.6 mu m with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
   onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6
   microns suffered from strong systematics, and conclusions could hardly
   be obtained with confidence on the water detection by comparison of the
   3.6 and 5.8 microns observations.
   Aims. We aim at constraining the atmospheric structure and composition
   of the planet and improving previously derived parameters.
   Methods. We use a high-S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to
   improve the precision of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6
   mu m. The observation has been performed using high-cadence time series
   integrated in the subarray mode. We are able to derive accurate system
   parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter,
   scale of the system, and central time of the transit from the fits of
   the transit light curve. We compare the results with transmission
   spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations at the
   same wavelength.
   Results. We obtained the following system parameters of R-p/R-star =
   0.15566-0.00024(-0.00024)(+0.00011) , b = 0.661(-0.0050)(+0.0053), and
   a/R-star = 8.925(-0.0523)(+0.0490) at 3.6 mu m. These measurements are
   three times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength
   because they benefit from greater observational efficiency and less
   statistic and systematic errors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius
   ratio has to be corrected for stellar activity and present a method to
   do so using ground-based long-duration photometric follow-up in the
   V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio corrected for the
   stellar variability agrees with our previous measurement obtained in the
   same bandpass. We also discuss that water vapour could not be detected
   by a comparison of the planetary radius measured at 3.6 and 5.8 mu m,
   because the radius measured at 3.6 mu m is affected by absorption by
   other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.},

abstract={NASA's Kepler Mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The mission reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: (1) a 152 Ã‚Â± 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 Ã‚Â± 0.024 hr with ephemeris TÃ‚Â [BJD] =2454964.57375 +0.00060 Ã¢Â€Â“0.00082 + N *0.837495 +0.000004 Ã¢Â€Â“0.000005 days and (2) a 376 Ã‚Â± 9Ã‚Â ppm dimming lasting 6.86 Ã‚Â± 0.07 hr with ephemeris TÃ‚Â [BJD] =2454971.6761 +0.0020 Ã¢Â€Â“0.0023 + N *45.29485 +0.00065 Ã¢Â€Â“0.00076 days. Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at 1 minute cadence for >4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties. Kepler-10 is a relatively old (11.9 Ã‚Â± 4.5Ã‚Â Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like main-sequence star with T eff = 5627 Ã‚Â± 44Ã‚Â K, M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} = 0.895 Ã‚Â± 0.060 M Ã¢Â˜Â‰ , and R ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/sstarf.gif] {sstarf} = 1.056 Ã‚Â± 0.021 R Ã¢Â˜Â‰ . Physical models simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that speak to its rocky composition: M P = 4.56 +1.17 Ã¢Â€Â“1.29 M Ã¢ÂŠÂ• , R P = 1.416 +0.033 Ã¢Â€Â“0.036 R Ã¢ÂŠÂ• , and ÃÂ P = 8.8 +2.1 Ã¢Â€Â“2.9Ã‚Â gÃ‚Â cm Ã¢Â€Â“3 .

Abstract = {We present an analysis of seven primary transit observations of the hot
   Neptune GJ436b at 3.6, 4.5, and 8 mu m obtained with the Infrared Array
   Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. After correcting for systematic
   effects, we fitted the light curves using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   technique. Combining these new data with the EPOXI, Hubble Space
   Telescope, and ground-based V, I, H, and K-s published observations, the
   range 0.5-10 mu m can be covered. Due to the low level of activity of
   GJ436, the effect of starspots on the combination of transits at
   different epochs is negligible at the accuracy of the data set.
   Representative climate models were calculated by using a
   three-dimensional, pseudospectral general circulation model with
   idealized thermal forcing. Simulated transit spectra of GJ436b were
   generated using line-by-line radiative transfer models including the
   opacities of the molecular species expected to be present in such a
   planetary atmosphere. A new, ab-initio-calculated, line list for hot
   ammonia has been used for the first time. The photometric data observed
   at multiple wavelengths can be interpreted with methane being the
   dominant absorption after molecular hydrogen, possibly with minor
   contributions from ammonia, water, and other molecules. No clear
   evidence of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is found from transit
   photometry. We discuss this result in the light of a recent paper where
   photochemical disequilibrium is hypothesized to interpret secondary
   transit photometric data. We show that the emission photometric data are
   not incompatible with the presence of abundant methane, but further
   spectroscopic data are desirable to confirm this scenario.},

  abstract={Gl581d has a minimum mass of 7 M Earth and is the first detected potentially habitable rocky Super-Earth. Our models confirm that a habitable atmosphere can exist on Gl581d. We derive spectroscopic features for atmospheres assuming an Earth-like composition for this planet, from high-oxygen atmosphere analogous to Earth's to high-CO 2 atmospheres with and without biotic oxygen concentrations. We find that a minimum CO 2 partial pressure of about 7 bar, in an atmosphere with a total surface pressure of 7.6 bar, is needed to maintain a mean surface temperature above freezing on Gl581d. We model transmission and emergent synthetic spectra from 0.4 ÃŽÂ¼m to 40 ÃŽÂ¼m and show where indicators of biological activities in such a planet's atmosphere could be observed by future ground- and space-based telescopes. The model we present here only represents one possible natureÃ¢Â€Â”an Earth-like compositionÃ¢Â€Â”of a planet like Gl581d in a wide parameter space. Future observations of atmospheric features can be used to examine if our concept of habitability and its dependence on the carbonate-silicate cycle is correct, and assess whether Gl581d is indeed a habitable Super-Earth.}

Abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional photochemical and thermochemical
   kinetics and diffusion model to study the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry on the atmospheric composition of ``hot-Jupiter{''}
   exoplanets. Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon,
   hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species on HD 189733b and HD 209458b and
   we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse
   observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular
   constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching
   and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b; however, the
   warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain
   thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are
   found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few
   bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and
   NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium
   chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons
   (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like
   OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N-2, and CO2 more closely follow
   their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures less than or similar to
   1 mu bar, where CO, H2O, and N-2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2
   is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced
   abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral
   signatures and thermal profiles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool,
   transiting exoplanets. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the
   assumed temperature structure and eddy diffusion coefficients and
   discuss further observational consequences of these models.},

   of these tenuous atmospheres at the surface of CoRot-7b, Kepler-10b, and
   55 Cnc-e, including idealized treatments of magnetic drag and ohmic
   dissipation. We find that atmospheric pressures remain close to their
   local saturation values in all cases. Despite the emergence of strongly
   supersonic winds which carry sublimating mass away from the substellar
   point, the atmospheres do not extend much beyond the day-night
   terminators. Ground temperatures, which determine the planetary thermal
   (infrared) signature, are largely unaffected by exchanges with the
   atmosphere and thus follow the effective irradiation pattern.
   Atmospheric temperatures, however, which control cloud condensation and
   thus albedo properties, can deviate substantially from the irradiation
   pattern. Magnetic drag and ohmic dissipation can also strongly impact
   the atmospheric behavior, depending on atmospheric composition and the

	remarkably flat transmission spectrum over the large wavelength domain

   INTERPRETATION BASED ON THE LAVA-OCEAN PLANET MODEL},
Journal = ApJL,

Abstract = {{The Kepler mission has made an important observation: the first
   detection of photons from a terrestrial planet by observing its phase
   curve (Kepler-10b). This opens a new field in exoplanet science: the
   possibility of obtaining information about the atmosphere and surface of
   rocky planets, objects of prime interest. In this Letter, we apply the
   Lava-ocean model to interpret the observed phase curve. The model, a
   planet without atmosphere and a surface partially made of molten rocks,
   has been proposed for planets of the class of CoRoT-7b, i.e., rocky
   planets very close to their star (at a few stellar radii). Kepler-10b is
   a typical member of this family. It predicts that the light from the
   planet has an important emission component in addition to the reflected
   one, even in the Kepler spectral band. Assuming an isotropical
   reflection of light by the planetary surface (Lambertian-like
   approximation), we find that a Bond albedo of similar to 50\% can
   account for the observed amplitude of the phase curve, as opposed to a
   first attempt where an unusually high value was found. We propose a
   physical process to explain this still large value of the albedo. The
   overall interpretation can be tested in the future with instruments such
   as the James Webb Space Telescope or the Exoplanet Characterization
   Observatory. Our model predicts a spectral dependence that is clearly
   distinguishable from that of purely reflected light and from that of a
   planet at a uniform temperature.}},

   instrument. The resulting spectra cover the range 2900-5700 angstrom and
   reach per exposure signal-to-noise ratio levels greater than 11 000
   within a 500-angstrom bandwidth. We used time series spectra obtained
   during two transit events to determine the wavelength dependence of the
   planetary radius and measure the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission
   spectrum for the first time over this wavelength range. Our
   measurements, in conjunction with existing HST spectra, now provide a
   broad-band transmission spectrum covering the full optical regime. The
   STIS data also show unambiguous evidence of a large occulted stellar
   spot during one of our transit events, which we use to place constraints
   on the characteristics of the K dwarf's stellar spots, estimating spot
   temperatures around T-eff similar to 4250 K. With contemporaneous
   ground-based photometric monitoring of the stellar variability, we also
   measure the correlation between the stellar activity level and
   transit-measured planet-to-star radius contrast, which is in good
   agreement with predictions. We find a planetary transmission spectrum in
   good agreement with that of Rayleigh scattering from a high-altitude
   atmospheric haze as previously found from HST Advanced Camera for
   Surveys. The high-altitude haze is now found to cover the entire optical
   regime and is well characterized by Rayleigh scattering. These findings
   suggest that haze may be a globally dominant atmospheric feature of the
   planet which would result in a high optical albedo at shorter optical
   wavelengths.},

   thermal mass loss formula which yields results that are comparable to
   hydrodynamic loss models. Our approach considers the effect of the Roche

   from observations of hot Jupiters. We study the influence of the mean
   planetary density on the thermal mass loss by placing hypothetical
   exoplanets with the characteristics of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and

   Moreover, our calculations show that the present time mass of both rocky

Mineral assemblages in the cores of old, eroded mountain chains that formed where continents collided show that the continental crust was buried deeply enough to have melted extensively. Geochemical, experimental, petrological and geodynamic modelling now show that when the continental crust melts the consequences are crustal-scale. The combination of melting and regional deformation is critical: the presence of melt on grain boundaries weakens rocks, and weak rocks deform faster, influencing the way mountain belts grow and how rifts propagate. Tectonic forces also drive the movement of melt out of the lower continental crust, resulting in an irreversible chemical differentiation of the crust.},

Abstract = {{We have obtained spatially resolved spectra of Titan in the
   near-infrared J, H and K bands at a resolving power of similar to 5000
   using the near-infrared integral field spectrometer (NIFS) on the Gemini
   North 8 m telescope. Using recent data from the Cassini/Huygens mission
   on the atmospheric composition and surface and aerosol properties, we
   develop a multiple-scattering radiative transfer model for the Titan
   atmosphere. The Titan spectrum at these wavelengths is dominated by
   absorption due to methane with a series of strong absorption band
   systems separated by window regions where the surface of Titan can be
   seen. We use a line-by-line approach to derive the methane absorption
   coefficients. The methane spectrum is only accurately represented in
   standard line lists down to similar to 2.1 mu m. However, by making use
   of recent laboratory data and modeling of the methane spectrum we are
   able to construct a new line list that can be used down to 1.3 mu m. The
   new line list allows us to generate spectra that are a good match to the
   observations at all wavelengths longer than 1.3 mu m and allow us to
   model regions, such as the 1.55 mu m window that could not be studied
   usefully with previous line lists such as HITRAN 2008. We point out the
   importance of the far-wing line shape of strong methane lines in
   determining the shape of the methane windows. Line shapes with
   Lorentzian, and sub-Lorentzian regions are needed to match the shape of
   the windows, but different shape parameters are needed for the 1.55 mu m
   and 2 mu m windows. After the methane lines are modeled our observations
   are sensitive to additional absorptions, and we use the data in the 1.55
   mu m region to determine a D/H ratio of 1.77 +/- 0.20 x 10(-4), and a CO
   mixing ratio of 50 +/- 11 ppmv. In the 2 mu m window we detect
   absorption features that can be identified with the nu(5) + 3 nu(6) and

Abstract = {{The search for rocky exoplanets plays an important role in our quest for
   extra-terrestrial life. Here, we discuss the extreme physical properties
   possible for the first characterised rocky super-Earth, CoRoT-7b (R-pl =
   1.58 +/- 0.10 R-Earth, M-pl = 6.9 +/- 1.2 M-Earth). It is extremely
   close to its star (a = 0.0171 AU = 4.48 R-st), with its spin and orbital
   rotation likely synchronised. The comparison of its location in the
   (M-pl, R-pl) plane with the predictions of planetary models for
   different compositions points to an Earth-like composition, even if the
   error bars of the measured quantities and the partial degeneracy of the
   models prevent a definitive conclusion. The proximity to its star
   provides an additional constraint on the model. It implies a high
   extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding efficient
   erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species
   including water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the
   planet is rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the
   physical properties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is
   made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure (P <= 1.5 Pa), no cloud
   can be sustained, and no thermalisation of the planet is expected. The
   dayside is very hot (2474 +/- 71 K at the sub-stellar point) while the
   nightside is very cold (50-75 K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the
   tungsten filament of an incandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and
   distillation of silicate rocks and the formation of a lava ocean. These
   possible features of CoRoT-7b could be common to many small and hot
   planets, including the recently discovered Kepler-10b. They define a new
   class of objects that we propose to name ``Lava-ocean planets{''}.}},

   transiting planet system HD 189733 taken with the Spitzer Space
   Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 8 mu m, as well as a

   techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new
   correction for the detector ``ramp{''} variation with a
   double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better
   physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings
   are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of
   2.7\% (68\% confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times
   measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a
   lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second
   planets in this system above 20\% of the mass of Mars in low-order
   mean-motion resonance at 95\% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the
   planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64\% as bright as
   the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of
   17\% (68\% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability
   at 8 mu m causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary
   eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are
   comparable at the 8 mu m photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of
   transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of
   the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental
   limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption
   measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared
   limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar
   atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69
   s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and
   33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot
   spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot
   spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this
   system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an
   upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of
   this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric
   precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less
   than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after

Here, we investigate whether we could distinguish rocky planets with recent major volcanism by remote observation. We develop a model for volcanic eruptions on an Earth-like exoplanet based on the present-day Earth and derive the observable features in emergent and transmission spectra for multiple scenarios of gas distribution and cloud cover. We calculate the observation time needed to detect explosive volcanism on exoplanets in primary as well as secondary eclipse and discuss the likelihood of observing volcanism on transiting Earth-sized to super-Earth-sized exoplanets. We find that sulfur dioxide from large explosive eruptions does present a spectral signal that is remotely detectable especially for secondary eclipse measurements around the closest stars and ground-based telescopes, and report the frequency and magnitude of the expected signatures. The transit probability of a planet in the habitable zone decreases with distance from the host star, making small, nearby host stars the best targets.}

We derive low-resolution detectable features for first generation space- and ground-based telescopes as a first step in comparative planetology. We assume that the surfaces and atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets (Earth-like and super-Earths) will most often be dominated by a specific geochemical cycle. Here we concentrate on the sulfur cycle driven by outgassing of SO 2 and H 2 S followed by their transformation to other sulfur-bearing species, which is clearly distinguishable from the carbon cycle, which is driven by outgassing of CO 2 . Due to increased volcanism, the sulfur cycle is potentially the dominant global geochemical cycle on dry super-Earths with active tectonics. We calculate planetary emission, reflection, and transmission spectrum from 0.4 Ã‚Âµm to 40 Ã‚Âµm with high and low resolution to assess detectable features using current and Archean Earth models with varying SO 2 and H 2 S concentrations to explore reducing and oxidizing habitable environments on rocky planets. We find specific spectral signatures that are observable with low resolution in a planetary atmosphere with high SO 2 and H 2 S concentration. Therefore, first generation space- and ground-based telescopes can test our understanding of geochemical cycles on rocky planets and potentially distinguish planetary environments dominated by the carbon and sulfur cycles.},

Journal = {Nature},

Abstract = {In contrast to planets with masses similar to that of Jupiter and
   higher, the bulk compositions of planets in the so-called super-Earth
   regime (masses 2-10 times that of the Earth) cannot be uniquely
   determined from a measurement of mass and radius alone. For these
   planets, there is a degeneracy between the mass and composition of both
   the interior and a possible atmosphere in theoretical models(1,2). The
   recently discovered transiting super-Earth exoplanet GJ 1214b is one
   example of this problem(3). Three distinct models for the planet that
   are consistent with its mass and radius have been suggested(4). Breaking
   the degeneracy between these models requires obtaining constraints on
   the planet's atmospheric composition(5,6). Here we report a ground-based
   measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b between wavelengths
   of 780 and 1,000 nm. The lack of features in this spectrum rules out (at
   4.9 sigma confidence) cloud-free atmospheres composed primarily of
   hydrogen. If the planet's atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, then it must
   contain clouds or hazes that are optically thick at the observed
   wavelengths at pressures less than 200 mbar. Alternatively, the
   featureless transmission spectrum is also consistent with the presence
   of a dense, water vapour atmosphere.},

   first super-Earth with measured radius}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{506}},
Pages = {287-302},
Abstract = {{Aims. We report the discovery of very shallow (Delta F/F approximate to
   3.4 x 10(-4)), periodic dips in the light curve of an active V = 11.7
   G9V star observed by the CoRoT satellite, which we interpret as caused
   by a transiting companion. We describe the 3-colour CoRoT data and
   complementary ground-based observations that support the planetary
   nature of the companion.
   Methods. We used CoRoT colours information, good angular resolution
   ground-based photometric observations in- and out- of transit, adaptive
   optics imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, and preliminary results from
   radial velocity measurements, to test the diluted eclipsing binary
   scenarios. The parameters of the host star were derived from optical
   spectra, which were then combined with the CoRoT light curve to derive
   parameters of the companion.
   Results. We examined all conceivable cases of false positives carefully,
   and all the tests support the planetary hypothesis. Blends with
   separation >0.40 `' or triple systems are almost excluded with a 8 x
   10(-4) risk left. We conclude that, inasmuch we have been exhaustive, we
   have discovered a planetary companion, named CoRoT-7b, for which we
   derive a period of 0.853 59 +/- 3 x 10(-5) day and a radius of R(p) =
   1.68 +/- 0.09 R(Earth). Analysis of preliminary radial velocity data
   yields an upper limit of 21 M(Earth) for the companion mass, supporting
   the finding.
   Conclusions. CoRoT-7b is very likely the first Super-Earth with a
   measured radius. This object illustrates what will probably become a
   common situation with missions such as Kepler, namely the need to
   establish the planetary origin of transits in the absence of a firm
   radial velocity detection and mass measurement. The composition of
   CoRoT-7b remains loosely constrained without a precise mass. A very high
   surface temperature on its irradiated face, approximate to 1800-2600 K
   at the substellar point, and a very low one, approximate to 50 K, on its
   dark face assuming no atmosphere, have been derived.}},

   of {HD 189733b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {507},

Abstract = {Context. Oxygen (O) and carbon ( C) have been inferred recently to be
   subsolar in abundance from spectra of the atmosphere of the transiting
   hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Yet, the mass and radius of the planet coupled
   with structure models indicate a strongly supersolar abundance of heavy
   elements in the interior of this object.
   Aims. Here we explore the discrepancy between the large amount of heavy
   elements suspected in the planet's interior and the paucity of volatiles
   measured in its atmosphere.
   Methods. We describe the formation sequence of the icy planetesimals
   formed beyond the snow line of the protoplanetary disk and calculate the
   composition of ices ultimately accreted in the envelope of HD 189733b on
   its migration pathway. This allows us to reproduce the observed volatile
   abundances by adjusting the mass of ices vaporized in the envelope.
   Results. The predicted elemental mixing ratios should be 0.15-0.3 times
   solar in the envelope of HD 189733b if they are fitted to the recent O
   and C determinations. However, our fit to the minimum mass of heavy
   elements predicted by internal structure models gives elemental
   abundances that are 1.2-2.4 times oversolar in the envelope of HD
   189733b.
   Conclusions. We propose that the most likely cause of this discrepancy
   is irradiation from the central star leading to development of a
   radiative zone in the planet's outer envelope which would induce
   gravitational settling of elements. Hence, all strongly irradiated
   extrasolar planets should present subsolar abundances of volatiles. We
   finally predict that the abundances of nitrogen (N), sulfur ( S) and
   phosphorus ( P) are of similar to 2.8 x 10(-5), 5.3 x 10(-6) and 1.8 x
   10(-7) relative to H(2), respectively in the outer part of HD 189733b's

Abstract = {Water, methane, and carbon monoxide are expected to be among the most
   abundant molecules besides molecular hydrogen in the hot atmosphere of
   close-in extrasolar giant planets. Atmospheric models for these planets
   predict that the strongest spectrophotometric features of those
   molecules are located at wavelengths ranging from 1 to 10 mu m making
   this region of particular interest. Consequently, transit observations
   in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) allow the atmospheric content of transiting
   planets to be determined. We present new primary transit observations of
   the hot-Jupiter HD 189733b, obtained simultaneously at 4.5 and 8 mu m
   with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.
   Together with a new refined analysis of previous observations at 3.6 and
   5.8 mu m using the same instrument, we are able to derive the system
   parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter,
   scale of the system, and central time of the transit from fits of the
   transit light curves at these four wavelengths. We measure the four
   planet-to-star radius ratios, to be (R(p)/R(star))3.6 mu m = 0.1545 +/-
   0.0003, (R(p)/R(star))4.5 mu m = 0.1557 +/- 0.0003, (R(p)/R(star))5.8 mu
   m = 0.1547 +/- 0.0005, and (R(p)/R(star))8 mu m = 0.1544 +/- 0.0004. The
   high accuracy of the planet radii measurement allows the search for
   atmospheric molecular absorbers. Contrary to a previous analysis of the
   same data set, our study is robust against systematics and reveals that
   water vapor absorption at 5.8 mu m is not detected in this photometric
   data set. Furthermore, in the band centered around 4.5 mu m we find a
   hint of excess absorption with an apparent planetary radius Delta
   R(p)/R({*}) = 0.00128 +/- 0.00056 larger (2.3 sigma) than the one
   measured simultaneously at 8 mu m. This value is 4 sigma above what
   would be expected for an atmosphere where water vapor is the only
   absorbing species in the near-IR. This shows that an additional species
   absorbing around 4.5 mu m could be present in the atmosphere. Carbon
   monoxide (CO) being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible
   candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H(2)O ratio between 5 and 60.},

Abstract = {We present new Spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot
   Jupiter HD 189733b in the MIPS 24 mu m bandpass, spanning the same part
   of the planet's orbit as our previous observations in the IRAC 8 mu m
   bandpass (Knutson et al. 2007). We find that the minimum
   hemisphere-averaged flux from the planet in this bandpass is 76\% +/-
   3\% of the maximum flux; this corresponds to minimum and maximum
   hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/- 48 K and 1220 +/-
   47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an orbital
   phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20
   degrees-30 degrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked
   hot Jupiters would have enormous day-night temperature differences in
   the absence of winds, the small amplitude of the observed phase
   variation indicates that the planet's atmosphere efficiently transports
   thermal energy from the day side to the night side at the 24 mu m
   photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature differences. The
   similarities between the 8 and 24 mu m phase curves for HD 189733b lead
   us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a
   fundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by
   these two wavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models
   indicate that the 8 mu m band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater
   than at 24 mu m, although the uncertain methane abundance complicates
   the interpretation. If these two bandpasses do probe different
   pressures, it would indicate that the temperature varies only weakly
   between the two sensed depths, and hence that the atmosphere is not
   convective at these altitudes. We also present an analysis of the
   possible contribution of star spots to the time series at both 8 and 24
   mu m based on near-simultaneous ground-based observations and additional
   Spitzer observations. Accounting for the effects of these spots results
   in a slightly warmer night-side temperature for the planet in both

Title = {DETERMINATION OF THE MINIMUM MASSES OF HEAVY ELEMENTS IN THE ENVELOPES
   OF JUPITER AND SATURN},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {696},
Pages = {1348-1354},
Abstract = {We calculate the minimum mass of heavy elements required in the
   envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn to match the observed oversolar
   abundances of volatiles. Because the clathration efficiency remains
   unknown in the solar nebula, we have considered a set of sequences of
   ice formation in which the fraction of water available for clathration
   is varied between 0 and 100\%. In all the cases considered, we assume
   that the water abundance remains homogeneous whatever the heliocentric
   distance in the nebula and directly derives from a gas phase of solar
   composition. Planetesimals then form in the feeding zones of Jupiter and
   Saturn from the agglomeration of clathrates and pure condensates in
   proportions fixed by the clathration efficiency. A fraction of Kr and Xe
   may have been sequestrated by the H(3)(+) ion in the form of stable
   XeH(3)(+) and KrH(3)(+) complexes in the solar nebula gas phase, thus
   implying the formation of at least partly Xe- and Kr-impoverished
   planetesimals in the feeding zones of Jupiter and Saturn. These
   planetesimals were subsequently accreted and vaporized into the hydrogen
   envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, thus engendering volatiles enrichments
   in their atmospheres, with respect to hydrogen. Taking into account both
   refractory and volatile components, and assuming plausible molecular
   mixing ratios in the gas phase of the outer solar nebula, we show that
   it is possible to match the observed enrichments in Jupiter and Saturn,
   whatever the clathration efficiency. Our calculations predict that the
   O/H enrichment decreases from similar to 5.5 to 5.1 time (O/H)(circle
   dot) in the envelope of Jupiter and from 15.2 to 14.1 times(O/H)(circle
   dot) in the envelope of Saturn with the growing clathration efficiency
   in the solar nebula. As a result, the minimum mass of ices needed to be
   injected in the envelope of Jupiter decreases from similar to 20.0 to
   18.6 M(circle plus), including a mass of water diminishing from 10.4 to
   9.3 M(circle plus). In the same conditions, the minimum mass of ices
   needed in the envelope of Saturn decreases from similar to 16.7 to 15.6
   M(circle plus), including amass of water diminishing from 8.6 to 7.7
   M(circle plus). The accretion of planetesimals with ices to rocks ratios
   similar to 1 in the envelope of Jupiter, namely a value derived from the
   bulk densities of Ganymede and Callisto, remains compatible with the
   mass of heavy elements predicted by interior models. On the other hand,
   the accretion of planetesimals with similar ice-to-rock in the envelope
   of Saturn implies a mass of heavy elements greater than the one
   predicted by interior models, unless a substantial fraction of the
   accreted rock and water sedimented onto the core of the planet during
   its evolution.},

   20 mass\% of water, and/or similar to 5 mass\% of carbon compounds.
   Hydrogen-rich atmospheres can be outgassed as a result of oxidizing
   metallic iron with water, and excess water and carbon can produce
   atmospheres through simple degassing. As a byproduct of our atmospheric

Abstract = {Opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of
   ultracool dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. We report
   here on the detailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our
   group for this application. We also present tables of Rosseland and
   Planck mean opacities, which are of use in some studies of the
   atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs. For
   the tables presented here we have included the opacities of important
   atomic and molecular species, including the alkali elements,
   pressure-induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant opacity
   sources, but we neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each
   species how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of
   public databases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public
   databases, and our own numerical calculations. We combine these
   opacities with abundances computed from a chemical equilibrium model
   using recently revised solar abundances to compute mean opacities. The
   chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the settling of
   condensates in a gravitational field and is applicable to ultracool
   dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks.
   We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially

Title = {The presence of methane in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet},
Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {452},
Pages = {329-331},
Abstract = {Molecules present in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets are expected
   to influence strongly the balance of atmospheric radiation, to trace
   dynamical and chemical processes, and to indicate the presence of
   disequilibrium effects. As molecules have the potential to reveal
   atmospheric conditions and chemistry, searching for them is a high
   priority. The rotational - vibrational transition bands of water, carbon
   monoxide and methane are anticipated to be the primary sources of non-
   continuum opacity in hot- Jupiter planets(1-3). As these bands can
   overlap in wavelength, and the corresponding signatures from them are
   weak, decisive identification requires precision infrared spectroscopy.
   Here we report a near- infrared transmission spectrum of the planet HD
   189733b that shows the presence of methane. Additionally, a resolved
   water vapour band at 1.9 mu m confirms the recent claim(4) of water in
   this object. On thermochemical grounds, carbon monoxide is expected to
   be abundant in the upper atmosphere of hot- Jupiter planets, but is not
   identifiable here; therefore the detection of methane rather than carbon
   monoxide in such a hot planet(5,6) could signal the presence of a
   horizontal chemical gradient away from the permanent dayside, or it may
   imply an ill- understood photochemical mechanism that leads to an
   enhancement of methane.},

Title = {{K-H$_2$} quasi-molecular absorption detected in the {T}-dwarf epsilon {Indi Ba}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {474},
Pages = {L21-L24},
Abstract = {Context. T-type dwarfs present a broad and shallow absorption feature
   centred around 6950 angstrom in the blue wing of the K doublet at 0.77
   mu m which resembles in depth and shape the satellite absorption
   predicted by detailed collisional broadening profiles. In our previous
   work, the position of the predicted line satellite was however somewhat
   too blue compared to the observed feature.
   Aims. In this paper, we investigate whether new calculations of the
   energy surfaces of the potentials in the K-H-2 system, including
   spin-orbit coupling, result in a closer coincidence of the satellite
   with the observed position. We also investigate the extent to which CaH
   absorption bands contribute to the feature and at what T-eff these
   respective opacity sources predominate.
   Methods. We present model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, including
   gravitational settling for an improved description of depth-dependent
   abundances of refractory elements, and based on new K-H-2 line profiles
   using improved interaction potentials.
   Results. By comparison with a high signal-to-noise optical spectrum of
   the T1 dwarf epsilon Indi Ba, we find that these new models do reproduce
   the observed feature, while CaH does not contribute for the atmospheric
   parameters considered. We also find that CaH is settled out so deep into
   the atmosphere that even turbulent vertical mixing would appear
   insufficient to bring significant amounts of CaH to the observable
   photosphere in dwarfs of later type than similar to L5.
   Conclusions. We conclude that previous identification of the feature at
   this location in the spectra of T dwarfs as well as the latest L dwarfs
   with CaH was erroneous, as expected on physical grounds: calcium has
   already condensed onto grains in early L dwarfs and thus should have
   settled out of the photosphere in cooler brown dwarfs. This finding
   revokes one of the observational verifications for the cloud-clearing
   theory assumption: a gradual clearing of the cloud cover in early T
   dwarfs.},

  abstract={We use new interior models of cold planets to investigate the mass-radius relationships of solid exoplanets, considering planets made primarily of iron, silicates, water, and carbon compounds. We find that the mass-radius relationships for cold terrestrial mass planets of all compositions we considered follow a generic functional form that is not a simple power law: log 10 R s = k 1 + ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/669/2/1279/img2.gif] {img2.gif} log 10 ( M s ) - k 2 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/669/2/1279/img4.gif] {img4.gif} for up to M p Ã¢Â‰Âˆ 20 M Ã¢ÂŠÂ• , where M s and R s are scaled mass and radius values. This functional form arises because the common building blocks of solid planets all have equations of state that are well approximated by a modified polytrope of the form ÃÂ = ÃÂ 0 + cP n . We find that highly detailed planet interior models, including temperature structure and phase changes, are not necessary to derive solid exoplanet bulk composition from mass and radius measurements. For solid exoplanets with no substantial atmosphere we have also found the following: with 5% fractional uncertainty in planet mass and radius it is possible to distinguish among planets composed predominantly of iron or silicates or water ice but not more detailed compositions; with ~5% uncertainty water ice planets with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 25% water by mass may be identified; the minimum plausible planet size for a given mass is that of a pure iron planet; and carbon planet mass-radius relationships overlap with those of silicate and water planets due to similar zero-pressure densities and equations of state. We propose a definition of "super-Earths" based on the clear distinction in radii between planets with significant gas envelopes and those without.}

Journal = {Nature},
Year = {2007},

Pages = {183-186},
Abstract = {`Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked
   because they are close (< 0.05 astronomical units, where 1 AU is the
   average Sun - Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in
   permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet
   and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able
   to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets(1-3). A
   key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy
   incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the
   temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report
   observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary
   systems(4-6), over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a
   `map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in
   brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a
   minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness
   temperature of 1,212 +/- 11K at a wavelength of 8 mm, indicating that
   energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed
   throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot
   Jupiter 7. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphereintegrated
   brightness occurs 16 +/- 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a
   hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (
   when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than
   predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

Title = {{L} and {T} dwarf models and the {L} to {T} transition},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2006},
Volume = {640},
Pages = {1063-1077},
Abstract = {Using a model for refractory clouds, a novel algorithm for handling
   them, and the latest gas-phase molecular opacities, we have produced a
   new series of L and T dwarf spectral and atmosphere models as a function
   of gravity and metallicity, spanning the T-eff range from 2200 to 700 K.
   The correspondence with observed spectra and infrared colors for early
   and mid-L dwarfs and for mid-to late T dwarfs is good. We find that the
   width in infrared color-magnitude diagrams of both the T and L dwarf
   branches is naturally explained by reasonable variations in gravity and
   therefore that gravity is the ``second parameter'' of the L-T dwarf
   sequence. We investigate the dependence of theoretical dwarf spectra and
   color-magnitude diagrams on various cloud properties, such as particle
   size and cloud spatial distribution. In the region of the L -> T
   transition, we find that no single combination of cloud particle size
   and gravity can be made to fit all the observed data. Our results
   suggest that current ignorance of detailed cloud meteorology renders
   ambiguous the extraction of various physical quantities such as Teff and
   gravity for mid-L to early T dwarfs. Nevertheless, for decreasing Teff,
   we capture with some accuracy the major spectral features and signatures
   observed. We speculate that the subdwarf branch of the L dwarfs would be
   narrower in effective temperature and that for low enough metallicity
   the L dwarfs would disappear altogether as a spectroscopic class.

Abstract = {We have created a general methodology for calculating the

   189733b, TrES-1, and HD 209458b, we calculate planet/star flux ratios
   during secondary eclipse and compare them with the Spitzer data points
   obtained so far in the mid-infrared. We introduce a simple
   parameterization for the redistribution of heat to the planet's night
   side, derive constraints on this parameter (P-n), and provide a general
   set of predictions for planet/star contrast ratios as a function of
   wavelength, model, and phase. Moreover, we calculate average dayside and
   nightside atmospheric temperature/pressure profiles for each transiting
   planet/ Pn pair with which existing and anticipated Spitzer data can be
   used to probe the atmospheric thermal structure of severely irradiated
   EGPs. We find that the baseline models do a good job of fitting the

   not yet small enough to discriminate cleanly among all the various

Abstract = {{Context. Among the 160 known exoplanets, mainly detected in large
   radial- velocity surveys, only 8 have a characterization of their actual
   mass and radius thanks to the two complementary methods of detection:
   radial velocities and photometric transit.
   Aims. We started in March 2004 an exoplanet- search programme biased
   toward high- metallicity star stars which are more frequently host
   extra- solar planets. This survey aims to detect close- in giant
   planets, which are most likely to transit their host star.
   Methods. For this programme, high- precision radial velocities are
   measured with the ELODIE fiber- fed spectrograph on the 1.93- m
   telescope, and high- precision photometry is obtained with the CCD
   Camera on the 1.20- m telescope, both at the Haute- Provence
   Observatory.
   Results. We report here the discovery of a new transiting hot Jupiter
   orbiting the star orbiting HD189733. The planetary nature of this object
   is confirmed by the observation of both the spectroscopic and
   photometric transits. The exoplanet HD189733 b, with an orbital period
   of 2.219 days, has one of the shortest orb orbital periods detected by
   radial velocities, and presents the largest photometric depth in the
   light curve c (similar to 3\%) observed to date. We estimate for the
   planet a mass of 1.15 +/- 0. 04 M-J and a radius of 1. 26 +/- 0. 03 R-J.
   Considering that HD189733 has. the same visual magnitude as the well
   known exoplanet host star HD209458, further ground- based and space-
   based follow- up observations are very promising and will permit a
   characterization of the atmosphere and exosphere of this giant
   exoplanet.}},

Abstract = {{We report precise Doppler measurements of GJ 436 (M2.5 V) obtained at

   orbital period of 2.644 days, eccentricity of 0.12 (consistent with
   zero), and velocity semiamplitude of K = 18.1 m s(-1). The minimum mass
   (M sin i) for the planet is 0.067M(Jup) = 1.2M(Nep) = 21M(Earth), making
   it the lowest mass exoplanet yet found around a main-sequence star and
   the first candidate in the Neptune-mass domain. GJ 436 (mass = 0.41 M.)
   is only the second M dwarf found to harbor a planet, joining the
   two-planet system around GJ 876. The low mass of the planet raises
   questions about its constitution, with possible compositions of
   primarily H and He gas, ice/rock, or rock-dominated. The implied
   semimajor axis is a = 0.028 AU = 14 stellar radii, raising issues of
   planet formation, migration, and tidal coupling with the star. GJ 436 is
   more than 3 Gyr old, based on both kinematic and chromospheric
   diagnostics. The star exhibits no photometric variability on the 2.644
   day Doppler period to a limiting amplitude of 0.0004 mag, supporting the
   planetary interpretation of the Doppler periodicity. Photometric
   transits of the planet across the star are ruled out for gas giant
   compositions and are also unlikely for solid compositions. As the third

Title = {{A new method for probing the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets}},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {{2004}},

Pages = {L1-L6},
Abstract = {{Although atmospheric transmission spectroscopy of HD 209458b with the
   Hubble Space Telescope has been very successful, so far no atmospheric
   absorption features have been detected from the ground. Here we present
   a new method for probing the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets which
   may be more suitable for ground-based observations, making use of the
   Rossiter effect. During a transit, an exoplanet sequentially blocks off
   light from the approaching and receding parts of the rotating star,
   causing an artificial radial velocity wobble. The amplitude of this
   signal is directly proportional to the effective size of the transiting
   object, and the wavelength dependence of this effect can reveal
   atmospheric absorption features, in a similar way as with transmission
   spectroscopy. The advantage of this method over conventional atmospheric
   transmission spectroscopy is that it does not rely on accurate
   photometric comparisons of observations on and off transit, but instead
   depends on the relative velocity shifts of individual stellar absorption
   lines within the same on-transit spectra. We used an archival data set
   from the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope to
   apply this method to HD 209458. The amplitude of the Rossiter effect is
   shown to be 1.7(-1.2)(+1.1) m s(-1) higher in the Sodium D lines than in
   the weighted average of all other absorption lines in the observed
   wavelength range, corresponding to an increment of 4.3 +/- 3 per cent
   (1.4sigma). The uncertainty in this measurement compares to a
   photometric accuracy of 5 x 10(-4) for conventional atmospheric
   transmission spectroscopy, more than an order of magnitude higher than
   previous attempts using ground-based telescopes. Observations
   specifically designed for this method could increase the accuracy
   further by a factor of 2-3.}},

Abstract = {We have analyzed Titan observations performed by the Infrared Space
   Observatory (ISO) in the range 7-30 mum. The spectra obtained by three
   of the instruments on board the mission (the short wavelength
   spectrometer, the photometer, and the camera) were combined to provide
   new and more precise thermal and compositional knowledge of Titan's
   stratosphere. With the high spectral resolution achieved by the SWS
   (much higher than that of the Voyager I IRIS spectrometer), we were able
   to detect and separate the contributions of most of the atmospheric
   gases present on Titan and to determine disk-averaged mole fractions. We
   have also tested existing vertical distributions for C2H2, HCN, C2H6,
   and CO2 and inferred some information on the abundance of the first
   species as a function of altitude. From the CH3D band at 1161 cm(-1) and
   for a CH, mole fraction assumed to be 1.9\% in Titan's stratosphere, we
   have obtained the monodeuterated methane-averaged abundance and
   retrieved a D/H isotopic ratio of 8.7(-1.9)(+3.2) x 10(-5). We discuss
   the implications of this value with respect to current evolutionary
   scenarios for Titan. The v, band of HC3N at 663 cm(-1) was observed for
   the first time in a disk-averaged spectrum. We have also obtained a
   first tentative detection of benzene at 674 cm(-1), where the fit of the
   ISO/SWS spectrum at R = 1980 is significantly improved when a constant
   mean mole fraction of 4 X 10(-10) of C6H6 is incorporated into the
   atmospheric model. This corresponds to a column density of similar to 2
   x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) above the 30-mbar level. We have also tested
   available vertical profiles for HC3N and C6H6 and adjusted them to fit
   the data. Finally, we have inferred upper limits of a few 10(-10) for a
   number of molecules proposed as likely candidates on Titan (such as
   allene, acetonitrile, propionitrile, and other more complex gases). (C)

The calculations cover a wide temperature and pressure range in the upper portions of giant planetary and T-, L-, and M-dwarf atmospheres. Emphasis is placed on the major gases CH4, CO, NH3, N2, and \{H2O\} but other less abundant gases are included. The results presented are independent of particular model atmospheres, and can be used to constrain model atmosphere temperatures and pressures from observations of different gases. The influence of metallicity on the speciation of these key elements under pressureÃ¢Â€Â“temperature (PÃ¢Â€Â“T) conditions relevant to low-mass object atmospheres is discussed. The results of the thermochemical equilibrium computations indicate that several compounds may be useful to establish temperature or pressure scales for giant planet, brown dwarf, or dwarf star atmospheres. We find that ethane and methanol abundance are useful temperature probes in giant planets and methane dwarfs such as Gl 229B, and that \{CO2\} can serve as a temperature probe in more massive objects. Imidogen (NH) abundances are a unique pressure-independent temperature probe for all objects. Total pressure probes for warmer brown dwarfs and M dwarfs are HCN, HCNO, and CH2O. No temperature-independent probes for the total pressure in giant planets or T-dwarf atmospheres are identified among the more abundant C, N, and O bearing gases investigated here. "

The sensitivity of the model results to variations in the eddy diffusion coefficient profile, the solar flux, the \{CH4\} photolysis branching ratios, the atomic hydrogen influx, and key reaction rates are discussed in detail. We find that \{C4H2\} and \{CH3C2H\} are particularly good tracers of important chemical processes and physical conditions in Saturn's upper atmosphere, and \{C2H6\} is a good tracer of the eddy diffusion coefficient in Saturn's lower stratosphere. The eddy diffusion coefficient must be smaller than Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼3ÃƒÂ—104 cm2 sÃ¢ÂˆÂ’1 at pressures greater than 1 mbar in order to reproduce the \{C2H6\} abundance inferred from \{ISO\} observations. The eddy diffusion coefficients in the upper stratosphere could be constrained by observations of \{CH3\} radicals if the low-temperature chemistry of \{CH3\} were better understood. We also discuss the implications of our modeling for aerosol formation in Saturn's lower stratosphereÃ¢Â€Â”diacetylene, butane, and water condense between Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼1 and 300 mbar in our model and will dominate stratospheric haze formation at nonauroral latitudes.

   evidence in the atmosphere of Gliese 229B that it is depleted in heavy

   nonequilibrium processes, we perform a series of rainout calculations in

  abstract={We describe the parallel implementation of our generalized stellar atmosphere and non-LTE (NLTE) radiative transfer computer program PHOENIX. We discuss the parallel algorithms we have developed for radiative transfer, spectral line opacity, and NLTE opacity and rate calculations. Our implementation uses a multiple instruction-multiple data design based on a relatively small number of MPI library calls. We report the results of test calculations on a number of different parallel computers and discuss the results of scalability tests.}

abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to study the response of an Earth-like atmosphere to large increases in solar flux. For fully saturated, cloud-free conditions, the critical solar flux at which a runaway greenhouse occurs, that is, the oceans evaporate entirely, is found to be 1.4 times the present flux at Earth's orbit (S0). This value is close to the flux expected at Venus' orbit early in solar system history. It is nearly independent of the amount of \{CO2\} present in the atmosphere, but is sensitive to the \{H2O\} absorption coefficient in the 8- to 12-ÃƒÂŽÃ‚Â¼m window region. Clouds should tend to depress the surface temperature on a warm, moist planet; thus, Venus may originally have had oceans if its initial water endowment was close to that of Earth. It lost them early in its history, however, because of rapid photodissociation of water vapor followed by escape of hydrogen to space. The critical solar flux above which water is rapidly lost could be as low as 1.1S0. The surface temperature of a runaway greenhouse atmosphere containing a full ocean's worth of water would have been in excess of 1500ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â°KÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã¢Â€Âabove the solidus for silicate rocks. The presence of such a steam atmosphere during accretion may have significantly influenced the early thermal evolution of both Earth and Venus. }

abstract = {We have modeled the evolution of an impact-generated steam atmosphere surrounding an accreting Earth. The model assumes Safronov accretion; it includes degassing of planetesimals upon impact, thermal blanketing by a steam atmosphere, interchange of water between the surface and the interior, shock heating and convective cooling of Earth's interior, and hydrogen escape, both by a solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) powered planetary wind and by impact erosion (atmospheric cratering). The model does not include atmophiles other than water, chemical reaction of water with metallic iron, core formation, compression, and spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of accretion. If the incoming planetesimals were too dry or the EUV flux too high, very little water would accumulate at the surface. Essentially all water retained by such a planet would be through rehydration of silicates. If rehydration were inefficient, very little water would be retained in any form. Degassing of wetter planetesimals produces a steam atmosphere over a magma ocean, the energy of accretion being sufficient to maintain a runaway greenhouse atmosphere. The mass of the atmosphere is limited by water's solubility in the (partial) melt. This type of solution is produced for a wide range of model parameters. During accretion, Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼30 bars of water could have kept the surface at 1500Ã‚Â°K. As the accretional energy input declined below the runaway greenhouse threshold, the steam atmosphere rained out. Outgassing of dissolved water at the close of accretion is quantitatively important. These models can leave from Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼100 to more than 300 bars of water at the surface at the close of accretion. In general, most of the water accreted remains dissolved in the mantle. H2 could have escaped as rapidly as it formed only if the planetesimals were relatively dry. Consequently H2 should have accumulated until it reached chemical equilibrium with water vapor. Impact erosion (escape caused by impact) is a critical but poorly understood process. It can prevent the accumulation of a steam atmosphere if the planetesimals are sufficiently dry, or for wetter impactors if it is much more effective than we have assumed. Impact erosion of a steam atmosphere is less important; it is equivalent to a slightly drier rain of impactors. If a hypothetical Moon-forming impact took place before the collapse of the runaway greenhouse, relatively little water (Ã¢ÂˆÂ¼30Ã¢Â€Â“100 bars) would have been in the atmosphere; hence little could have been lost. If the event took place later, the potential damage could have been greater.}

A sharp distinction is made between the large quantity of speculations about the interiors of the bodies and the rather meagerfacts known with a reasonable degree of certainty. It is shown, however, that the latter are sufficient todisprove the old concept of a Laplacian disc of homogeneous chemical composition. There is asystematic variations in the chemical composition of planets (and probably also of satellites) so that heavy elements are more abundant in the outermost and in the innermost regions of the systems.},
