Abstract = {Prompted by the ongoing interest in Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer
   spectra of carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we have
   investigated the circumstellar chemistry of carbon stars in
   low-metallicity environments. Consistent with observations, our models
   show that acetylene is particularly abundant in the inner regions of low
   metallicity carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars more abundant than
   carbon monoxide. As a consequence, larger hydrocarbons have higher
   abundances at the metallicities of the Magellanic Clouds than in stars
   with solar metallicity. We also find that the oxygen and nitrogen
   chemistry is suppressed at lower metallicity, as expected. Finally, we
   calculate molecular line emission from carbon stars in the Large and
   Small Magellanic Cloud and find that several molecules should be readily
   detectable with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array at Full Science
   operations.},

Title = {{Possible sources for methane and C-2-C-5 organics in the plume of
   Enceladus}},
Journal = PSS,
Year = {2012},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {73-79},
Abstract = {We consider six possible sources of CH4 and other lowmass (C-2-C-5)
   organics in the plume of Enceladus: three of these sources represent
   initial endowments of organics: cometary organics, Titan-like tholin,
   and the Fisher-Tropsch type reactions in the gases from which Enceladus
   formed. The other three sources represent processes inside Enceladus:
   water-rock reactions, microbiology, and thermogenesis. We report on new
   laboratory results for C-2 hydrocarbons released by thermogenesis of
   laboratory tholin and the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis. Thermal
   processing of Titan-like tholin produced ratios of CH4/C2H4 and CH4/C2H6
   of about two for temperatures up to 450 degrees C and about six for a
   temperature of 650 degrees C. The low pressure (similar to 1 atm)
   Fisher-Tropsch type experiments produced CH4/C2H4 of similar to 1.5,
   similar to previous results. C2H2 was not produced by either process.
   Tests of gas production by four strains of methanogens confirmed the
   absence of any detectable production of non-methane hydrocarbons.
   Cometary endowment, the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis, and Titan-like
   tholin incorporation could be primary inputs of organics and subsequent
   thermal processing of any of these all are possible sources of low mass
   organics in the plume. Biological production and water-rock reactions
   are an alternative source of CH4. Aqueous reactions with CO and H-2 can
   produce C-2-C-5 organics even at the low pressures of the interior of
   Enceladus. If there is a confirmed detection of CO and C2H2 in the plume
   of Enceladus, this provides an important constraint on sources, as we
   have identified no process, other than the initial volatile component of
   cometary organics, which can supply these gases. Precise determination
   of the relative concentrations of C-1-C-5 hydrocarbons may provide
   additional constraints on sources, but a detailed isotopic analysis of C
   and H in these organics and a search for amino acids constitute the next
   important steps in resolving the sources of the organics in Enceladus'
   plume. },

Abstract = {A variety of molecular species, from simple diatoms to complex
   polyatomic molecules, have been identified in many gaseous
   extraterrestrial environments, such as the atmospheres of solar planets
   and satellites, exoplanets, cometary comae and the interstellar medium.
   The detection of relatively complex molecules can be taken as evidence
   that some chemical evolution has occurred. The modeling of such
   evolution requires the knowledge of all the important elementary
   reactions, which should be identified and included with the appropriate
   parameters, possibly determined in laboratory experiments. Among the
   different types of processes which are called into play, gas-phase
   neutral-neutral bimolecular reactions are expected to play a major role.
   In this paper, the contributions made by the crossed molecular beam
   investigations of neutral-neutral bimolecular reactions will be
   illustrated. In particular, recent achievements obtained in our
   laboratory and concerning the identification of the reaction products
   and their branching ratios, an essential piece of information for the
   building up of a realistic modeling of the above-mentioned environments,

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {737},
Abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional photochemical and thermochemical
   kinetics and diffusion model to study the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry on the atmospheric composition of ``hot-Jupiter{''}
   exoplanets. Here we investigate the coupled chemistry of neutral carbon,
   hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen species on HD 189733b and HD 209458b and
   we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse
   observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular
   constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching
   and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b; however, the
   warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain
   thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are
   found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few
   bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and
   NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium
   chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons
   (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like
   OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N-2, and CO2 more closely follow
   their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures less than or similar to
   1 mu bar, where CO, H2O, and N-2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2
   is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced
   abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral
   signatures and thermal profiles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool,
   transiting exoplanets. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the
   assumed temperature structure and eddy diffusion coefficients and
   discuss further observational consequences of these models.},

   column densities and temperatures by modelling the molecular absorption.
   While the relative abundances of the polyacetylenes are consistent with
   chemical models for the outer envelopes of evolved carbon stars, those
   for HC3N and HCN are not. It is not clear whether the presence of
   benzene indicates an efficient means of formation, or instead a
   protective environment that inhibits photo-destruction.},

Title = {Metal-rich carbon stars in the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy},
Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {396},
Pages = {598-608},
Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope
   of six carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the
   Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) and two foreground
   Galactic carbon stars. The band strengths of the observed C(2)H(2) and
   SiC features are very similar to those observed in Galactic AGB stars.
   The metallicities are estimated from an empirical relation between the
   acetylene optical depth and the strength of the SiC feature. The
   metallicities are higher than those of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and
   close to Galactic values. While the high metallicity could imply an age
   of around 1 Gyr, for the dusty AGB stars, the pulsation periods suggest
   ages in excess of 2 or 3 Gyr. We fit the spectra of the observed stars
   using the DUSTY radiative transfer model and determine their dust
   mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0-3.3 x 10(-8) M(circle dot)
   yr(-1). The two Galactic foreground carbon-rich AGB stars are located at
   the far side of the solar circle, beyond the Galactic Centre. One of
   these two stars shows the strongest SiC feature in our present Local
   Group sample.},

Journal = {ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF THE BIOSPHERE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {477-487},
Abstract = {Methane and other larger hydrocarbons have been proposed as possible
   greenhouse gases on early Mars. In this work we explore if volcanic
   processes may have been a source for such molecules based on theoretical
   and experimental considerations. Geologic evidence and numerical
   simulations indicate that explosive volcanism was widely distributed
   throughout Mars. Volcanic lightning is typically produced in such
   explosive volcanism. Therefore this geologic setting was studied to
   determine if lightning could be a source for hydrocarbons in volcanic
   plumes. Volcanic lightning was simulated by focusing a high-energy
   infrared laser beam inside of a Pyrex reactor that contained the
   proposed volcanic gas mixture composed of 64\% CH4, 24\% H-2, 10\% H2O
   and 2\% N-2, according to an accretion model and the nitrogen content
   measured in Martian meteorites. The analysis of products was performed
   by gas chromatography coupled to infrared and mass spectroscopy. Eleven
   hydrocarbons were identified among the products, of which acetylene
   (C2H2) was the most abundant. A thermochemical model was used to
   determine which hydrocarbons could arise only from volcanic heat. In
   this case, acetylene and ethylene are formed at magmatic temperatures.
   Our results indicate that explosive volcanism may have injected into the
   atmosphere of early Mars similar to 6 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of acetylene,
   and similar to 2 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of 1,3-butadiyne, both produced by
   volcanic lightning, similar to 5 x 10(11) g yr(-1) of ethylene produced
   by volcanic heat, and 10(13) g yr(-1) of methane.},

Title = {{Three-micron spectra of AGB stars and supergiants in nearby galaxies}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {434},
Pages = {691-706},
Abstract = {The dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied
   using infrared L- band spectra of AGB stars ( both carbon- rich and
   oxygen- rich) and M- type supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic
   Clouds ( LMC and SMC) and in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
   The spectra cover SiO bands for oxygen- rich stars, and acetylene (
   C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon- rich AGB stars. The equivalent width
   of acetylene is found to be high even at low metallicity. The high C2H2
   abundance can be explained with a high carbon- to- oxygen ( C/ O) ratio
   for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast, the HCN equivalent
   width is low: fewer than half of the extra- galactic carbon stars show
   the 3.5 $\mu$m HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN equivalent
   width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon elemental
   abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
   mass, and stars with high luminosity ( i. e. high initial mass) could
   have a high HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-
   galactic and Galactic carbon stars. One SMC post- AGB star, SMC- S2,
   shows the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH band. This first detection of a PAH band from an
   SMC post- AGB star confirms PAHs can form in these low- metallicity
   stars. None of the oxygen- rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
   possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the
   equivalent widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30
   angstrom for LMC metallicity. Several possible explanations are
   discussed, mostly based on the effect of pulsation and circumstellar
   dust. The observations imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach
   mass- loss rates as high as their Galactic counterparts, because there
   are more carbon atoms available and more carbonaceous dust can be
   formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO suggests less dust and lower
   mass- loss rates in low- metallicity oxygen- rich stars. The effect on
   the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.},

Abstract = {The strong interactions of shock waves caused by stellar pulsation, the

   importance of using reasonable mean gas opacities in grey dynamic
