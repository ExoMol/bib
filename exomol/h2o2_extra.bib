  abstract = {{We searched for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the Martian atmosphere
	using data measured by the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) onboard
	Mars Express during five martian years (MY27-31). It is well known
	that H2O2 plays a key role in the oxidizing capacity of the Martian
	atmosphere. However, only a few studies based on ground-based observations
	can be found in the literature. Here, we performed the first analysis
	of H2O2 using long-term measurements by a spacecraft-borne instrument.
	We used the v(4) band of H2O2 in the spectral range between 359 cm(-1)
	and 382 cm(-1) where strong features of H2O2 are present around 362
	cm(-1) and 379 cm(-1). Since the features were expected to be very
	weak even at the strong band, sensitive data calibrations were performed
	and a large number of spectra were selected and averaged. We made
	three averaged spectra for different seasons over relatively low
	latitudes (50 degrees S-50 degrees N). We found features of H2O2
	at 379 cm(-1), whereas no clear features were detected at 362 cm(-1)
	due to large amounts of uncertainty in the data. The derived mixing
	ratios of H2O2 were close to the detection limits: 16 +/- 19 ppb
	at Ls = 0-120 degrees, 35 +/- 32 ppb at Ls = 120-240 degrees, and
	41 +/- 28 ppb at Ls = 240-360 degrees. The retrieved value showed
	the detection of H2O2 only for the third seasonal period, and the
	values in the other periods provided the upper limits. These long-term
	averaged abundances derived by the PFS generally agreed with the
	ones reported by ground-based observations. From our derived mixing
	ratio of H2O2, the lifetime of CH4 in the Martian atmosphere is estimated
	to be several decades in the shortest case. Our results and sporadic
	detections of CH4 suggest the presence of strong CH4 sinks not subject
	to atmospheric oxidation. }},

  journal = JCP,
  year = {1993},
  volume = {99},
  pages = {8519-8541},
  abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
	levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The
	method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
	of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
	iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
	vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
	as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions
	in each off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more
	than cn(f+1) multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates.
	Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation
	(DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal.
	The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by
	the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions)
	at most two. The n(f+1) scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed
	second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to
	any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety
	of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond),
	for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic
	energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged
	band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1,
	and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results
	for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify the causes of discrepancies
	in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices
	(up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within
	an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using
	explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule
	and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos
	method to all the examples presented here with a single computer
	program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality,
	and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly
	with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

  journal = JCP,
  year = {2000},
  volume = {113},
  pages = {1329-1347},
  abstract = {A new discrete variable representation (DVR) in generalized vibrational
	coordinates is proposed together with a new mixed diabatic/adiabatic
	contraction technique for the treatment of multidimensional vibrational
	problems up to high vibrational excitations. Formally based on the
	equidistant Chebyshev DVR in the grid index the new formulation is
	particularly suitable for multidimensional minimum energy paths.
	The new Z-matrix DVR proposed in this paper encompasses usual valence
	coordinates as well as nonlinear maps of coordinates on optimal nonequidistant
	grids. The pointwise numerical calculation of all kinetic energy
	terms avoids the algebraic derivation of specialized analytical forms
	of the kinetic energy adding to the flexibility of the method. With
	efficient truncation schemes the generalized DVR allows for a compact
	representation of the time-dependent wave-packet dynamics in up to
	six dimensions. Vibrationally adiabatic approaches to the detailed
	modelling of multidimensional quantum-dynamics usually are hampered
	by the typically large number of (avoided) crossings in dense spectra.
	This problem is particularly severe for discrete variable representations.
	A solution is provided by the new technique of diabatic rotations
	leading to a systematic construction of locally diabatic channels.
	This allows the treatment of very dense spectra where conventional
	truncation techniques fail. Applying the new approach to the vibrational
	problem of tetratomic molecules demonstrates its flexibility and
	efficiency. The examples of formaldehyde, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide
	cover the whole range from semirigid (CH2O) to large amplitude inversion
	(NH3) and torsional tunnelling dynamics (H2O2). In solving the full
	six-dimensional vibrational eigenvalue problems for CH2O and NH3
	the Z-matrix DVR shows at least comparable if not superior numerical
	efficiency compared with specialized techniques. In the case of H2O2
	the technique of diabatic rotations and adiabatic contraction for
	the first time allows the treatment of the tunneling dynamics significantly
	above the dissociation threshold up to the fifth OH stretch overtone.
	The calculated decrease of the tunneling rate by about one order
	of magnitude agrees well with experimental observations. (C) 2000

  abstract = {In the present paper, the roto-torsional energy levels of hydrogen
	peroxide are determined from ab initio calculations performed at
	the MP4(SDQ)/AUG-cc-pVTZ//MP4(SDQ)/cc-pVTZ level. The rotational
	levels corresponding to the torsional states n = 0 and 1 are determined
	variationally up to J = 20. The flexible model used considers the
	roto-vibrational interactions. Symmetry conditions are included for
	classifying the levels and reducing the cost of diagonalization.
	Products of contracted torsional basis functions and top symmetric
	solutions are employed as basis functions. The calculated levels
	are in a very good agreement with the experimental data. In addition,
	the K-doubling has been obtained and the levels fitted to the top
	symmetric equations for determining the centrifugal distortion constants.
	The expectation values of the rotational constants at the lowest
	torsional levels are compared with the rotational constants arising
	from the experimental fit. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

  year = {2002},
  volume = {214},
  pages = {11-20},
  abstract = {A general variational method for calculating vibrational energy levels
	of tetraatomic molecules is presented. The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian
	of the system is expressed in a set of coordinates defined by three
	orthogonalized vectors in the body-fixed frame without any dynamical
	approximation. The eigenvalue problem is solved by a Lanczos iterative
	diagonalization algorithm. which requires the evaluation of the action
	of the Hamiltonian operator on a vector, The Lanczos recursion is
	carried out in a mixed grid/basis set, i.e., a direct product discrete
	variable representation (DVR) for the radial coordinates and a nondirect
	product finite basis representation (FBR) for the angular coordinates.
	The action of the potential energy operator on a vector is accomplished
	via a pseudo-spectral transform method. Six types of orthogonal coordinates
	are implemented in this algorithm, which is capable of describing
	most four-atom systems with small and/or large amplitude vibrational
	motions. Its application to the molecules H2CO, NH3, and HOOH and
	the van der Vaals cluster He2Cl2 is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier
