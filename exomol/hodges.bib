Pages = {532-534},
Abstract = {{Challenging applications in trace gas measurements require low
   uncertainty and high acquisition rates(1-4). Many cavityenhanced
   spectroscopies exhibit significant sensitivity and potential(5,6), but
   their scanning rates are limited by reliance on either mechanical or
   thermal frequency tuning(7). Here, we present frequency-agile, rapid
   scanning spectroscopy (FARS) in which a high-bandwidth electro-optic
   modulator steps a selected laser sideband to successive optical cavity
   modes. This approach involves no mechanical motion and allows for a
   scanning rate of 8 kHz per cavity mode, a rate that is limited only by
   the cavity response time itself. Unlike rapidly frequency-swept
   techniques(8-11), FARS does not reduce the measurement duty cycle,
   degrade the spectrum's frequency axis or require an unusual cavity
   configuration. FARS allows for a sensitivity of similar to 2 x 10(-12)
   cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) and a tuning range exceeding 70 GHz. This technique
   shows promise for fast and sensitive trace gas measurements and studies
   of chemical kinetics.}},

Title = {{Spectroscopic line parameters of water vapor for rotation-vibration
   transitions near 7180 cm(-1)}},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{79}},
Abstract = {{We present low uncertainty measurements of line parameters for 15
   rotation-vibration transitions of water vapor in the wave number range
   of 7170.27-7183.02 cm(-1). These experiments incorporated
   frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy and a primary
   standard humidity generator which produced a stable and accurately known
   amount of water vapor in a nitrogen carrier gas stream. Intensities and
   line shape factors were derived by fitting high-resolution spectra to
   spectral models that account for collisional narrowing and
   speed-dependent broadening and shifting effects. For most transitions
   reported here, we estimate the relative combined standard uncertainty of
   the line intensities to be < 0.4\%, of which approximately one half this
   value we ascribe to limited knowledge of the line shape. Our measured
   intensities and broadening parameters are compared to experimental and
   theoretical literature values. Agreement between our experimental
   intensity measurements and those derived by recent ab initio
   calculations of the dipole moment surface of water vapor is within
   1.5\%.}},

Title = {{Low-uncertainty H2O line intensities for the 930-nm region}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {6-13},
Abstract = {{We measured room-temperature H2O spectra of the 3v polyad within the
   wave number range 10603 cm(-1) to 10852 cm(-1) using frequency-
   stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy. More than 70 transitions,
   divisible into two groups based on their relative intensities (strong
   and weak) were investigated. For the 23 lines comprising the set of
   strong transitions, the water vapor sample was prepared as a dilute
   mixture in a steady flow of N-2 carrier gas, and the measurement of the
   water vapor sample number density was linked to primary methods of
   humidity generation. For these strong transitions, the measured line
   intensities were within 1\% of previous measurements. The line intensity
   measurements of the weaker H2O transitions, were made on samples of
   static pure water vapor, and these results were systematically greater
   than previous measurements by approximately 20\%. Published by Elsevier
