abstract = {High-precision cavity-enhanced spectroscopic measurements are commonly
compromised by interferences caused by external etalons. Here, we present the
differential cavity ring-down spectroscopy (D-CRDS) technique for reducing these
perturbations. We discuss how etalons are caused by coupled-cavity interactions
between the primary ring-down cavity and other optical elements of the experiment,
and we model and experimentally verify how drift in cavity base loss correlates
with barometric pressure and laboratory temperature. D-CRDS measurements of near-infrared
CO2 spectra that are insensitive to etalon-induced distortions are then presented.
Based on an average of ∼100 spectra, these results yield a signal-to-noise ratio
of 170,000∶1 and a minimum detectable absorption coefficient of 4×10−12  cm−1.},

Title = {{Frequency-agile, rapid scanning spectroscopy}},
Journal = {Nat. Photon.},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {532-534},
Abstract = {Challenging applications in trace gas measurements require low
   uncertainty and high acquisition rates(1-4). Many cavityenhanced
   spectroscopies exhibit significant sensitivity and potential(5,6), but
   their scanning rates are limited by reliance on either mechanical or
   thermal frequency tuning(7). Here, we present frequency-agile, rapid
   scanning spectroscopy (FARS) in which a high-bandwidth electro-optic
   modulator steps a selected laser sideband to successive optical cavity
   modes. This approach involves no mechanical motion and allows for a
   scanning rate of 8 kHz per cavity mode, a rate that is limited only by
   the cavity response time itself. Unlike rapidly frequency-swept
   techniques(8-11), FARS does not reduce the measurement duty cycle,
   degrade the spectrum's frequency axis or require an unusual cavity
   configuration. FARS allows for a sensitivity of similar to 2 x 10(-12)
   cm(-1) Hz(-1/2) and a tuning range exceeding 70 GHz. This technique
   shows promise for fast and sensitive trace gas measurements and studies
   of chemical kinetics.},

journal = {SPIE},
volume = {8726},
pages = {87260O-2},
year = {2013},
abstract = {The effect of finite beam extinction ratio on the precision and
accuracy of cavity ring-down decay time constant measurements was examined using
the frequency-agile, rapid scanning, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (FARS-CRDS)
technique. This new approach to CRDS uses a waveguide-based electro-optic phase
modulator (EOM) to provide a laser beam extinction ratio as high as 80 dB: a
value that is ≈30 dB greater than that typically achieved with acousto-optic-modulator-
based beam switches. We find that the observed measurement precision scales inversely
with extinction ratio, such that an EOM enables measurement of the cavity ring-down
decay time with a relative precision of ≈8×10-5. We demonstrate that insufficient
extinction can be the dominant cause of statistical uncertainty for extinction
ratios below 60 dB. Furthermore, insufficient extinction can result in non-exponential
decays, which cause systematic measurement biases in cavity losses and absorption.},

   transitions near 7180 cm(-1)}},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {79},
pages= {052507},
Abstract = {We present low uncertainty measurements of line parameters for 15
   rotation-vibration transitions of water vapor in the wave number range
   of 7170.27-7183.02 cm(-1). These experiments incorporated
   frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy and a primary
   standard humidity generator which produced a stable and accurately known
   amount of water vapor in a nitrogen carrier gas stream. Intensities and
   line shape factors were derived by fitting high-resolution spectra to
   spectral models that account for collisional narrowing and
   speed-dependent broadening and shifting effects. For most transitions
   reported here, we estimate the relative combined standard uncertainty of
   the line intensities to be < 0.4\%, of which approximately one half this
   value we ascribe to limited knowledge of the line shape. Our measured
   intensities and broadening parameters are compared to experimental and
   theoretical literature values. Agreement between our experimental
   intensity measurements and those derived by recent ab initio
   calculations of the dipole moment surface of water vapor is within
   1.5\%.},

Abstract = {We measured room-temperature H2O spectra of the 3v polyad within the
   wave number range 10603 cm(-1) to 10852 cm(-1) using frequency-
   stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy. More than 70 transitions,
   divisible into two groups based on their relative intensities (strong
   and weak) were investigated. For the 23 lines comprising the set of
   strong transitions, the water vapor sample was prepared as a dilute
   mixture in a steady flow of N-2 carrier gas, and the measurement of the
   water vapor sample number density was linked to primary methods of
   humidity generation. For these strong transitions, the measured line
   intensities were within 1\% of previous measurements. The line intensity
   measurements of the weaker H2O transitions, were made on samples of
   static pure water vapor, and these results were systematically greater
   than previous measurements by approximately 20\%. Published by Elsevier

pages = {023113},
abstract = {We describe a frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down absorption spectrometer
with automated scanning capabilities. The system utilizes the comb of ring-down
cavity resonances as frequency markers for spectral scans. The comb is actively
stabilized with respect to a frequency-stabilized reference laser, and the continuous
wave, single-mode probe laser frequency is in turn actively stabilized with respect
to resonances of the ring-down cavity frequency comb. Ring-down spectra are
obtained by locking the external-cavity diode laser probe to sequential cavity
resonances (separated by the ring-down cavity free spectral range), and the ring-down
cavity frequency comb is translated by controlled amounts using acousto-optic
frequency shifting methods for fine frequency steps less than the free-spectral
range. A computer-controlled method for automating frequency tuning and probe
laser locking to the cavity resonances is described, and high-resolution near-infrared
(vicinity of 10712cm−1) absorption spectra of water vapor are presented. A
frequency resolution of ≈1MHz and minimum measurable line intensity of 10−27cm2cm−1molecule−1
are demonstrated.},

abstract = {We present a cavity ring-down spectroscopy apparatus suitable for
high-resolution absorption spectroscopy. The central feature of the spectrometer

ring-down cavity mirrors that are designed to have relatively high losses and
low losses at the respective wavelengths of the reference laser and probe laser,
the cavity stabilization dynamics are decoupled from frequency jitter of the probe
laser. We use the cavity eigenfrequencies as markers in spectral scans and achieve
a frequency resolution of ≈1 MHz. Five rovibrational transitions in the (2,0,1)
vibrational band of water vapor near 0.935 μm are probed with a continuous-wave
external-cavity diode laser, and their line strengths are determined and compared
to literature values. Collisional narrowing effects and pressure shifting are
observed, illustrating the applicability of the method for quantitative line shape
studies of weakly absorbing systems.},
