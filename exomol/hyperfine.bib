    vibronic state. The frequencies have been determined with an uncertainty of 
    less than 1 MHz, representing a more than 1000-fold improvement over previous measurements. 
    Spectral traces are measured by scanning a frequency comb stabilized continuous-wave 
    spectroscopy laser over the molecular transitions and detecting laser-induced 
    fluorescence from SH molecules in a highly collimated molecular beam. To determine 
    the absolute transition frequencies, the traces are fit with a quantum-mechanical model 
    that accounts for saturation effects and shifts due to quantum interference. 
    The model also provides estimates of the predissociation rate of the excited-state levels. 
    Weighted averages of the hyperfine-resolved transition frequencies are computed in order to
    enable comparisons to measurements where the hyperfine structure is not resolved. 
    These hyperfine-averaged frequencies indicate that the absolute transition frequencies 
    determined in previous measurements were about ∼2.1 GHz (0.07 cm-1) too high. 
    Finally, the measured transition frequencies are fit using an effective Hamiltonian model, 
    resulting in more precise estimates of the spectroscopic constants.},

Twelve low-lying $\Lambda$-S electronic states of the 24Mg35Cl molecule have been calculated at the multireference configuration interaction level of theory. The spin-orbit coupling effects are taken into account in the electronic structure calculations. Spectroscopic constants agree well with previously obtained theoretical and experimental values. On the basis of the potential energy curves and transition dipole moments, the highly diagonally distributed Franck-Condon factors for the A2$\Pi$ → X2$\Sigma$+ transition and short radiative lifetime of the A2$\Pi$ state are determined. Then, employing a quantum effective Hamiltonian approach, we investigate the hyperfine manifolds of the X2$\Sigma$+ state and obtain the zero-field hyperfine spectrum with the errors relative to the experimental data not exceeding 8-20 kHz. Finally, we design a laser cooling scheme with one cooling main laser beam and two repumping laser beams with modulated sidebands, which is sufficient for the implementation of efficient laser slowing and cooling of the 24Mg35Cl molecule. Moreover, it is important to note that the dissociation energy (2.2593 eV) of the B2$\Sigma$+ state is obtained for the first time at the multireference configuration interaction level. We hope that this can provide a helpful reference for experimental observation.},

Using the aug-cc-pVTZ-J basis set, we test a range of correlation exchange functionals against experimental values for a series of first row transition metal complexes. This has been done both with (AisoK = AFCK + APCK) and without (AisoK = AFC K) spin orbit coupling included. Overall, hybrid functionals perform best, although some exceptions are found. Furthermore, we analyze molecular orbital contributions to the Fermi contact term. We find a great difference in the relative magnitude of contributions from frontier orbitals and inner or outer-core orbitals. Complexes, where the frontier orbital contribution exceeds the core-orbital contributions, are always small, ionic complexes ("class 1"). For these complexes, the computational requirements with respect to the one-electron basis set are not severe, and regular basis sets such as aug-cc-pVTZ provide reasonable results. Unfortunately, the core contributions to AFCK are either comparable ("class 2") or far exceed ("class 3") the contributions from the frontier orbitals in both organometallic and traditional coordination complexes. Agreement with experimental results can for these complexes only be obtained by use of specialized core-property basis sets such as the aug-cc-pVTZ-J basis set. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Using the finite field approach to compute the dipole moment, restricted coupled cluster RCCSD(T) and complete active space-configuration interaction CAS-CI+Q methods yield values (1.09-1.12 D) that are essentially identical to experiment. In contrast, dipole moments computed as an expectation value of the dipole moment operator typically differ from experiment by 0.1-0.6 D. The rather unfavorable comparisons with experiment reported in previous theoretical studies may stem, in part, from the method chosen to evaluate the dipole moment. Magnetic hyperfine properties were evaluated using a variety of unrestricted and restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock-based methods. We estimated the full CI limiting properties by exploiting the convergence behavior of a sequence of MRCI wave functions. The isotropic component A iso( 14N) of 39±1 MHz evaluated in this fashion is in excellent accord with the experimental value of 41.4±1.7 MHz. Highly correlated UHF-based methods [e.g., CCSD(T) and QCISD(T)] yield comparable values of 40-41 MHz that are in good agreement with both experiment and the apparent full CI limit. However, for A iso( 17O), the full CI limit (-97±2 MHz) and the UHF-based results (ca.-118 MHz) differ by roughly 20 MHz.

@article{66Freedx.hyperfine,
abstract = {In order to fully utilize the experimental accuracy of the high resolution afforded by radio-frequency spectroscopy, a fourth-order treatment of the energy is required. Especially, this fourth-order treatment is expected to be necessary in order to separate the quadrupolar interactions of light atoms in molecules from pseudoquadrupolar contributions to the energy due to magnetic hyperfine interactions which are off diagonal in the rotational state. The example of 3II states intermediate between Hund's Cases (a) and (b), where J is still a good quantum number, is chosen to demonstrate the general techniques of such a fourth-order calculation. (Particular reference is made to the a 3II state of isotopically substituted CO.) Van Vleck's method of reversed angular momentum is generalized to spherical tensor form in anticipation of future needs in the calculation of hyperfine structures of more complex systems. The spectroscopic parameters are explicitly written as matrix elements of the nonrelativistic wavefunctions in order that they be usable as checks on approximate molecular wavefunctions. Second-order Stark and Zeeman effects are also discussed.},

@article{60Linxxx.hyperfine,
abstract = {The frequencies of the magnetic resonance spectrum of the NO molecule has been recalculated by using the new value of spin-orbit coupling constants and by taking the effect of l uncoupling into consideration. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is improved over the previous calculation. By combining the magnetic hyperfine and nuclear quadrupole coupling constants the ratio of the quadrupole moment to the magnetic moment of the nitrogen nucleus is obtained. The nuclear quadrupole moment of nitrogen is found to be (0.016±0.007)×10-24 cm2. The uncertainty of this value is chiefly due to that of the coupling constants rather than to the nature of the method itself. {\textcopyright} 1960 The American Physical Society.},

@article{48BaToxx.hyperfine,
abstract = {Methods are given for the computation of nuclear quadrupole interactions in molecules. They apply primarily to the interpretation of microwave spectra of linear and symmetric top molecules in which either one or two nuclei on the molecular axis show quadrupole coupling to the molecular field. Tables are given of the energy values, based on Casimir's formula, for the quadrupole coupling of a single nucleus, and also of transformation coefficients for application to the case of intermediate coupling when two nuclei are involved. Spectral intensities are discussed briefly. Examples are given to illustrate various aspects of the theory. The molecules BrCN and CICN show quadrupole effects resulting from the nitrogen nucleus as well as to the halogen. In the latter case, the intermediate coupling theory is required for a complete explanation of the observed microwave-absorption lines, as there are significant deviations from the first-order linear approximation. {\textcopyright} 1948 The American Physical Society.},
