abstract = {We report absolute transition frequencies for the allowed transitions from 
    the X2$\Pi$3/2, v″ = 0, J″ = 3/2 rovibronic ground state of 32S1H to the A2ς+, v′ = 0 
    vibronic state. The frequencies have been determined with an uncertainty of 
    less than 1 MHz, representing a more than 1000-fold improvement over previous measurements. 
    Spectral traces are measured by scanning a frequency comb stabilized continuous-wave 
    spectroscopy laser over the molecular transitions and detecting laser-induced 
    fluorescence from SH molecules in a highly collimated molecular beam. To determine 
    the absolute transition frequencies, the traces are fit with a quantum-mechanical model 
    that accounts for saturation effects and shifts due to quantum interference. 
    The model also provides estimates of the predissociation rate of the excited-state levels. 
    Weighted averages of the hyperfine-resolved transition frequencies are computed in order to
    enable comparisons to measurements where the hyperfine structure is not resolved. 
    These hyperfine-averaged frequencies indicate that the absolute transition frequencies 
    determined in previous measurements were about ∼2.1 GHz (0.07 cm-1) too high. 
    Finally, the measured transition frequencies are fit using an effective Hamiltonian model, 
    resulting in more precise estimates of the spectroscopic constants.},

Spectrosc. 245, 126-140 (2007)] by adding the extra term in the Hamiltonian that describes the nuclear quadrupole coupling, with no inherent limitation on the number of quadrupolar nuclei in a molecule. We applied the new approach to compute the nitrogen-nuclear-quadrupole hyperfine structure in the rovibrational spectrum of NH314. These results agree very well with recent experimental spectroscopic data for the pure rotational transitions in the ground vibrational and $\nu$2 states and the rovibrational transitions in the $\nu$1, $\nu$3, 2$\nu$4, and $\nu$1 + $\nu$3 bands. The computed hyperfine-resolved rovibrational spectrum of ammonia will be beneficial for the assignment of experimental rovibrational spectra, further detection of ammonia in interstellar space, and studies of the proton-to-electron mass variation.},

@article{95GlFePe.hyperfine,
abstract = {The dipole moment and magnetic hyperfine properties of the A 2$\Sigma$ + Rydberg state of nitric oxide have been evaluated at a variety of levels of theory with extended correlation consistent basis sets. Using the finite field approach to compute the dipole moment, restricted coupled cluster RCCSD(T) and complete active space-configuration interaction CAS-CI+Q methods yield values (1.09-1.12 D) that are essentially identical to experiment. In contrast, dipole moments computed as an expectation value of the dipole moment operator typically differ from experiment by 0.1-0.6 D. The rather unfavorable comparisons with experiment reported in previous theoretical studies may stem, in part, from the method chosen to evaluate the dipole moment. Magnetic hyperfine properties were evaluated using a variety of unrestricted and restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock-based methods. We estimated the full CI limiting properties by exploiting the convergence behavior of a sequence of MRCI wave functions. The isotropic component A iso( 14N) of 39±1 MHz evaluated in this fashion is in excellent accord with the experimental value of 41.4±1.7 MHz. Highly correlated UHF-based methods [e.g., CCSD(T) and QCISD(T)] yield comparable values of 40-41 MHz that are in good agreement with both experiment and the apparent full CI limit. However, for A iso( 17O), the full CI limit (-97±2 MHz) and the UHF-based results (ca.-118 MHz) differ by roughly 20 MHz. It remains unclear how to reconcile this large discrepancy. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The theory and spectroscopy of the hydrogen molecular ion in its isotopic forms H2+, HD+ and D2+ is reviewed. Theoretical treatments are directed towards the calculation of potential energy curves, vibration-rotation energies and nuclear hyperfine constants. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the Schrodinger equation for H2+ can be solved exactly, but further approximations must be developed to describe the coupling of electronic and nuclear motion. The lack of a centre of symmetry in HD+ creates difficulties in the theory. Radiofrequency hyperfine transitions have been measured for H 2+ using quadrupole trapping and photoalignment. Ion beam methods have been used to measure vibration-rotation transitions in HD +, and attention has been paid to levels very close to the dissociation limit. Analysis of proton and deuteron nuclear hyperfine structure reveals extreme asymmetry of the electron distribution in these levels. The hyperfine interactions have been measured by radiofrequency/infrared and microwave/infrared double resonance experiments. An electronic spectrum of D2+ arising through excitation from the ground electronic state to the excited long-range state has been measured using both infrared and microwave radiation. Observation of a microwave electronic transition in H 2+ has provided experimental identification of the related H;H long-range complex.},

Especially, this fourth-order treatment is expected to be necessary in order to separate the quadrupolar interactions of light atoms in molecules from pseudoquadrupolar contributions to the energy due to magnetic hyperfine interactions which are off diagonal in the rotational state. The example of 3II states intermediate between Hund's Cases (a) and (b), where J is still a good quantum number, is chosen to demonstrate the general techniques of such a fourth-order calculation. (Particular reference is made to the a 3II state of isotopically substituted CO.) Van Vleck's method of reversed angular momentum is generalized to spherical tensor form in anticipation of future needs in the calculation of hyperfine structures of more complex systems. The spectroscopic parameters are explicitly written as matrix elements of the nonrelativistic wavefunctions in order that they be usable as checks on approximate molecular wavefunctions.
