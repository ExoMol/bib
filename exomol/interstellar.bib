Title = {{The Mid-infrared Molecular Inventory toward Orion IRc2}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2023},
Volume = {945},
Abstract = {We present the first high spectral resolution mid-infrared survey in the
   Orion BN/KL region, covering 7.2-28.3 mu m. With SOFIA/EXES, we target
   the enigmatic source Orion IRc2. While this is in the most prolifically
   studied massive star-forming region, longer wavelengths and molecular
   emission lines dominated previous spectral surveys. The mid-infrared
   observations in this work access different components and molecular
   species in unprecedented detail. We unambiguously identify two new
   kinematic components, both chemically rich with multiple molecular
   absorption lines. The ``blue clump{''} has vLSR = -7.1 +/- 0.7 km s(-1),
   and the ``red clump{''} has 1.4 +/- 0.5 km s(-1). While the blue and red
   clumps have similar temperatures and line widths, molecular species in
   the blue clump have higher column densities. They are both likely linked
   to pure rotational H-2 emission also covered by this survey. This work
   provides evidence for the scenario that the blue and red clumps are
   distinct components unrelated to the classic components in the Orion BN/
   KL region. Comparison to spectroscopic surveys toward other infrared
   targets in the region show that the blue clump is clearly extended. We
   analyze, compare, and present in-depth findings on the physical
   conditions of C2H2, (CCH2)-C-13, CH4, CS, H2O, HCN, (HCN)-C-13, HNC,
   NH3, and SO2 absorption lines and an H-2 emission line associated with
   the blue and red clumps. We also provide limited analysis of H2O and SiO
   molecular emission lines toward Orion IRc(2) and the atomic forbidden
   transitions {[}Fe II], {[}S I], {[}S III], and {[}Ne II].},
