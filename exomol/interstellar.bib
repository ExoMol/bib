Abstract = {A brief history of observations of H-2 and HD molecules is presented. The properties of H-2 and HD that make observations of them a uniquely powerful diagnostic probe are pointed out. The interpretations of the observations in the ultraviolet, near infrared and infrared made of a diverse range of astrophysical objects are discussed and the influence of H-2 and HD on their evolution is described.},
