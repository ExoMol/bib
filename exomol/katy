The star lies in a reddened line of sight where various experiments have detected anomalous microwave emission spatially correlated with dust thermal emission. The inferred total C2 column density of N(C2) = (10.5 ± 0.2) × 1013 cm−2 is well correlated with that of CH, as expected from theoretical models, and is among the highest reported for translucent clouds with similar extinction. The observed rotational C2 lines constrain the gas kinetic temperature T and the density n=n(H) +n(H2) of the intervening cloud to T= 40 ± 10 K and n= 250 ± 50 cm−3, respectively. This is the first determination of the gas kinetic temperature and particle density of a cloud with known anomalous microwave emission.}},

C2.bib:abstract = {The origin of \{C2\} high-pressure bands observed in discharges through \{CO\} has not been cleared up. The suggestion by Little and Browne of a collisional transfer between the metastable \{C2\} (5Πg, v=0) and the radiative \{C2\} (d3Πg, v=6) level was progress. However, these authors claimed that only the combination reaction C+C+M→C2+M should be invoked for the production of the metastable level, excluding the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction that other authors believed to be at the origin of the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. The correlation diagram of the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction shows that C2(5Πg) + \{CO\} correlates with ground-state reactants while C2(d3Πg) + \{CO\} does not. Such a reaction could thus be involved in the \{C2\} \{HP\} bands. A kinetic study of these bands in a fast-flow reactor, downstream from a microwave discharge through \{CO\} diluted in He, demonstrated that both reactions C + C + M and C+C2O were involved. It could be concluded that the C+C2O→C2+CO reaction has a lower branching ratio for C2(5Πg) production than C+C+M→C2+M. However, the C+C2O reaction has in most discharges, as in ours, a greater reaction rate than that of the C+C+M reaction so its contribution is not negligible and may be the main one if the dissociation rate of \{CO\} is low. }

H2O.bib:abstract= {The water vapour continuum is characterised by absorption that varies smoothly with wavelength, from the visible to the microwave. It is present within the rotational and vibrational--rotational bands of water vapour, which consist of large numbers of narrow spectral lines, and in the many `windows' between these bands. The continuum absorption in the window regions is of particular importance for the Earth's radiation budget and for remote-sensing techniques that exploit these windows. Historically, most attention has focused on the 8--12 $\mu$m (mid-infrared) atmospheric window, where the continuum is relatively well-characterised, but there have been many fewer measurements within bands and in other window regions. In addition, the causes of the continuum remain a subject of controversy. This paper provides a brief historical overview of the development of understanding of the continuum and then reviews recent developments, with a focus on the near-infrared spectral region. Recent laboratory measurements in near-infrared windows, which reveal absorption typically an order of magnitude stronger than in widely used continuum models, are shown to have important consequences for remote-sensing techniques that use these windows for retrieving cloud properties.},

Upper-state constants for the 32 isotope were obtained from a least-squares fit of the spectral lines of vr, keeping the ground-state constants fixed to the values determined by the combination difference fit. The standard deviation of the (0 10) line fit was 0.00 I7 cm-’ for the 32 isotope.

Ammonia has been observed in the interstellar medium up to J = 18 and more highly excited transitions are expected to appear in hot exoplanets and brown dwarfs. As a result, there is considerable interest in observing and assigning the high J (rovibrational) spectrum. In this work, numerous spectroscopic techniques were employed to study its high J transitions in the ground and nu(2) = 1 states. Measurements were carried out using a frequency multiplied submillimeter spectrometer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a tunable far-infrared spectrometer at University of Toyama, and a high-resolution Bruker IFS 125 Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Highly excited ammonia was created with a radiofrequency discharge and a dc discharge, which allowed assignments of transitions with J up to 35. One hundred and seventy seven ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion transitions were observed with microwave accuracy in the 0.3-4.7 THz region. Of these, 125 were observed for the first time, including 26 Delta K = 3 transitions. Over 2000 far-infrared transitions were assigned to the ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion bands as well as the nu(2) fundamental band. Of these, 1912 were assigned using the FTS data for the first time, including 222 Delta K = 3 transitions. The accuracy of these measurements has been estimated to be 0.0003-0.0006 cm(-1). A reduced root mean square error of 0.9 was obtained for a global fit of the ground and nu(2) = 1 states, which includes the lines assigned in this work and all previously available microwave, terahertz, far-infrared, and mid-infrared data. The new measurements and predictions reported here will support the analyses of astronomical observations by high-resolution spectroscopy telescopes such as Herschel, SOFIA, and ALMA. The comprehensive experimental rovibrational energy levels reported here will permit further refinement of the potential energy surface to improve ammonia ab initio calculations and facilitate assignment of new high-resolution spectra of hot ammonia.},

Atmospheric properties most consistent with these observed spectra are then derived with retrieval models. All retrieval models attempt to extract the maximum amount of atmospheric information from finite sets of data, but while the problem to be solved is fundamentally the same for any planetary atmosphere, until now all such models have been assembled ad hoc to address data from individual missions. In this paper, we describe a new general-purpose retrieval model, Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS (NEMESIS), which was originally developed to interpret observations of Saturn and Titan from the composite infrared spectrometer on board the \{NASA\} Cassini spacecraft. \{NEMESIS\} has been constructed to be generally applicable to any planetary atmosphere and can be applied from the visible/near-infrared right out to microwave wavelengths, modelling both reflected sunlight and thermal emission in either scattering or non-scattering conditions. \{NEMESIS\} has now been successfully applied to the analysis of data from many planetary missions and also ground-based observations. }
