It is shown that the momentum distributions of fragment ions produced from CS210+ are well reproduced by a classical explosion model incorporating the coordinate and momentum distributions of the initial ground vibrational state of CS2. On the other hand, a significant deviation is observed for CS23+ due to the non-Coulombic character of the potential energy surfaces. Coulomb explosion imaging is applied to real-time probing of Coulomb exploding CS2 in highly charged states, using a pair of intense few-cycle laser pulses. It is shown that the explosion proceeds in a different time scale depending on the charge state, mostly along the linear geometry during the bond-breaking of the two CS bonds.}

Title = {{Use of a nondirect-product basis for treating singularities in triatomic rotational-vibrational calculations}},
Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {3407-3415},
Abstract = {A technique has been developed which in principle allows the
determination of the full rotational-vibrational eigenspectrum of
triatomic molecules by treating the important singularities present in
the triatomic rotational-vibrational kinetic energy operator given in
Jacobi coordinates and the R, embedding. The singular term related to
the diatom-type coordinate, R-1, deemed to be unimportant for
spectroscopic applications, is given no special attention. The work
extends a previous {[}J. Chem. Phys., 2005, 122, 024101] vibration-only
approach and employs a generalized finite basis representation (GFBR)
resulting in a nonsymmetric Hamiltonian matrix {[}J. Chem. Phys., 2006,
124, 014110]. The basis set to be used is obtained by taking the direct
product of a 1-D DVR basis, related to R1, with a 5-D nondirect-product
basis, the latter formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions depending on
the distance-type coordinate causing the singularity, associated
Legendre polynomials depending on the Jacobi angle, and rotational
functions depending on the three Euler angles. The robust implicitly
restarted Arnoldi method within the ARPACK package is used for the
determination of a number of eigenvalues of the nonsymmetric Hamiltonian
matrix. The suitability of the proposed approach is shown by the
determination of the rotational-vibrational energy levels of the ground
electronic state of H-3(+) somewhat above its barrier to linearity.
Convergence of the eigenenergies is checked by an alternative approach,
employing a Hamiltonian expressed in Radau coordinates, a standard
direct-product basis, and no treatment of the singularities.},

Title = {{Treating singularities present in the Sutcliffe-Tennyson vibrational Hamiltonian in orthogonal internal coordinates}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {122},
Abstract = {Two methods are developed, when solving the related time-independent
Schrodinger equation (TISE), to cope with the singular terms of the
vibrational kinetic energy operator of a triatomic molecule given in
orthogonal internal coordinates. The first method provides a
mathematically correct treatment of all singular terms. The vibrational
eigenfunctions are approximated by linear combinations of functions of a
three-dimensional nondirect-product basis, where basis functions are
formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions, where DVR stands for discrete
variable representation, depending on distance-type coordinates and
Legendre polynomials depending on angle bending. In the second method
one of the singular terms related to a distance-type coordinate, deemed
to be unimportant for spectroscopic applications, is given no special
treatment. Here the basis set is obtained by taking the direct product
of a one-dimensional DVR basis with a two-dimensional nondirect-product
basis, the latter formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions and Legendre
polynomials. With the basis functions defined, matrix representations of
the TISE are set up and solved numerically to obtain the vibrational
energy levels of H-3(+). The numerical calculations show that the first
method treating all singularities is computationally inefficient, while
the second method treating properly only the singularities having
physical importance is quite efficient.},

Special care is devoted to the meaning of the experimental results in terms of quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, and other structural concepts dogma. Understanding the seemingly conflicting results from different dogmata is rationalized and scientific consequences are drawn.

Title = {{On derivation of curvilinear ro-vibrational quantum kinetic energy operator, for polyatomic molecules}},
Journal = THEOCHEM,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {433},
Pages = {69-81},
Abstract = {The vector formalism is a general approach that can supply, in an
efficient way, the algebraic expressions representing the kinetic
Hamiltonian operator of any quantum system of N particles, expressed in
curvilinear coordinates. In this study the possibilities of an improved
version of this formalism, in the context of nuclear movements of
molecular systems, are analyzed by obtaining the expressions
corresponding to several polyatomic systems. The internal coordinates
used in the present work are defined by establishing distances between
mass centers of nuclei groups, and by using logical Boolean parameters.
Other authors' results for four-atomic molecular systems (formaldehyde,
acetylene, satellite, symmetric dissociation cases) have also been
obtained and completed. The algebraic expressions of the first three
systems have been obtained also with an extended unified model, which
makes it possible to treat more complicated cases such as poly-ethane or
poly-satellite fragments, or as rotating body fixed x-axis coordinate
systems. It has been shown that all the kinetic terms of this extended
model can be obtained from 21 irreducible expressions.},

principle is used to determine the energy levels, and the kinetic energy
operator is simple and evaluated exactly. The computational procedure is
split up into the determination of one-dimensional radial basis
functions, the computation of a contracted rotational-bending basis,
followed by a final variational step coupling all degrees of freedom. An
angular basis is proposed whereby the rotational-bending contraction
takes place in three steps. Angular matrix elements of the potential are
evaluated by expansion in terms of a suitable basis, and the angular
integrals are given in a factorized form which simplifies their
evaluation. The basis functions in the final variational step have the
full permutation symmetries of the identical particles. Sample results
are given for HCCH and BH3.},

Title = {{Vibration-rotation hamiltonians of linear-molecules}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {943-951},
Abstract = {The construction of the molecular vibration-rotation Hamiltonian is
considered, with particular reference to two alternative treatments of
molecules with linear reference configurations. These can be considered
to have either (i) 3N - 5 vibrational and 2 rotational degrees of
freedom or (ii) 3N - 6 vibrational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom.
In either case the classical kinetic energy consists of vibrational,
rotational and translational parts given by 2T = SIGMA(k) P(k)2 +
SIGMA(alphabeta) omega(alpha)I(alphabeta)'omega(beta) + 1/M P2.
The rotational part contains the angular velocity omega and the
modified moment of inertia tensor I' of Wilson and Howard, which also
occurs in the relation J(alpha) - pi(alpha) =
SIGMA(beta)I(alphabeta)omega(beta)' involving the total (J) and
vibrational (pi) angular momenta. In case (i), I' has a vanishing z row
and column, where z is the axis of the molecule. This is associated with
the Sayvetz condition that the total angular momentum about the axis is
purely vibrational. These equations therefore contain only the two
components omega(x) and omega(y) of omega, which can be eliminated to
give the Hamiltonian form of the kinetic energy. In case (ii), the z
row and column of the I' matrix are non-vanishing and I' is
non-singular. The three components of omega can therefore be obtained in
terms of the angular momenta, to give a treatment that is entirely
analogous to that for a nonlinear reference configuration. The
parameters of the case (ii) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of those
of case (i).},

perturbative expansions for the vibrational energies. Only when
coupling terms are introduced do differences between the calculated
energies in the two representations become apparent. In CO2, where
there is pronounced configuration interaction between nearly degenerate

curvilinear normal coordinate Hamiltonian are converging significantly
faster than those obtained in the rectilinear normal coordinate
representation.},

abstract = {The form of the nonrigid bender has changes that here we do render. We add, nicely paired, a term to J2 and regroup factors that are singular. As a result, the nonrigid bender Hamiltonian can now be set up using only Van Vleck perturbation theory, for any triatomic molecule (linear, quasi-linear, or bent). It can be used to calculate the rotation-vibration energies of the molecule to high J(â<8b><8d>10) from the bending potential energy function and the stretch and stretch-bend force constants.}

abstract = {Abstract The spectroscopic selection rules for infrared and Raman transition between rotation‐vibrational states of axial molecules are formulated in terms of the appropriate quantum numbers and taking into account any rotation‐vibrational interaction. On this basis, expressions for the transition moment have been derived. The effect of all the degeneracies present in the field‐free case is included in these expressions. A special treatment is given of the diagonal approximation to the rotation‐vibrational interaction problem and in this case the expressions for the transition moment can be reduced and the selection rules expressed in terms of the usual quantum numbers.}
