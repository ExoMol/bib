Volume = {433},
Pages = {69-81},
Abstract = {The vector formalism is a general approach that can supply, in an
efficient way, the algebraic expressions representing the kinetic
Hamiltonian operator of any quantum system of N particles, expressed in
curvilinear coordinates. In this study the possibilities of an improved
version of this formalism, in the context of nuclear movements of
molecular systems, are analyzed by obtaining the expressions
corresponding to several polyatomic systems. The internal coordinates
used in the present work are defined by establishing distances between
mass centers of nuclei groups, and by using logical Boolean parameters.
Other authors' results for four-atomic molecular systems (formaldehyde,
acetylene, satellite, symmetric dissociation cases) have also been
obtained and completed. The algebraic expressions of the first three
systems have been obtained also with an extended unified model, which
makes it possible to treat more complicated cases such as poly-ethane or
poly-satellite fragments, or as rotating body fixed x-axis coordinate
systems. It has been shown that all the kinetic terms of this extended
model can be obtained from 21 irreducible expressions.},

Abstract = {In molecular vibration-rotation calculations it is frequently desirable
to work in a nuclear coordinate system tailored to the nuclear potential

operator for virtually any coordinate system by using computer algebra
programs. We discuss how to choose coordinates for use in practical
calculations, in particular variational energy level calculations, with
special consideration of the vibration-rotation separation. As an
example we present a kinetic energy operator suitable for calculating
the rovibrational spectrum of sequentially bonded four-atomic molecules,
using valence coordinates. We carry out a rigorous symmetry
classification usign the MS group, and also consider how the problem of
singularities affects the choice of basis set.},

Title = {{Treating singularities present in the Sutcliffe-Tennyson vibrational Hamiltonian in orthogonal internal coordinates}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {122},
Abstract = {Two methods are developed, when solving the related time-independent
Schrodinger equation (TISE), to cope with the singular terms of the
vibrational kinetic energy operator of a triatomic molecule given in
orthogonal internal coordinates. The first method provides a
mathematically correct treatment of all singular terms. The vibrational
eigenfunctions are approximated by linear combinations of functions of a
three-dimensional nondirect-product basis, where basis functions are
formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions, where DVR stands for discrete
variable representation, depending on distance-type coordinates and
Legendre polynomials depending on angle bending. In the second method
one of the singular terms related to a distance-type coordinate, deemed
to be unimportant for spectroscopic applications, is given no special
treatment. Here the basis set is obtained by taking the direct product
of a one-dimensional DVR basis with a two-dimensional nondirect-product
basis, the latter formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions and Legendre
polynomials. With the basis functions defined, matrix representations of
the TISE are set up and solved numerically to obtain the vibrational
energy levels of H-3(+). The numerical calculations show that the first
method treating all singularities is computationally inefficient, while
the second method treating properly only the singularities having
physical importance is quite efficient.},

Journal = PCCP,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {3407-3415},
Abstract = {A technique has been developed which in principle allows the
determination of the full rotational-vibrational eigenspectrum of
triatomic molecules by treating the important singularities present in
the triatomic rotational-vibrational kinetic energy operator given in
Jacobi coordinates and the R, embedding. The singular term related to
the diatom-type coordinate, R-1, deemed to be unimportant for
spectroscopic applications, is given no special attention. The work
extends a previous {[}J. Chem. Phys., 2005, 122, 024101] vibration-only
approach and employs a generalized finite basis representation (GFBR)
resulting in a nonsymmetric Hamiltonian matrix {[}J. Chem. Phys., 2006,
124, 014110]. The basis set to be used is obtained by taking the direct
product of a 1-D DVR basis, related to R1, with a 5-D nondirect-product
basis, the latter formed by coupling Bessel-DVR functions depending on
the distance-type coordinate causing the singularity, associated
Legendre polynomials depending on the Jacobi angle, and rotational
functions depending on the three Euler angles. The robust implicitly
restarted Arnoldi method within the ARPACK package is used for the
determination of a number of eigenvalues of the nonsymmetric Hamiltonian
matrix. The suitability of the proposed approach is shown by the
determination of the rotational-vibrational energy levels of the ground
electronic state of H-3(+) somewhat above its barrier to linearity.
Convergence of the eigenenergies is checked by an alternative approach,
employing a Hamiltonian expressed in Radau coordinates, a standard
direct-product basis, and no treatment of the singularities.},

faster than those obtained in the rectilinear normal coordinate

Volume = {79},
Pages = {943-951},
Abstract = {The construction of the molecular vibration-rotation Hamiltonian is
considered, with particular reference to two alternative treatments of
molecules with linear reference configurations. These can be considered
to have either (i) 3N - 5 vibrational and 2 rotational degrees of
freedom or (ii) 3N - 6 vibrational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom.
In either case the classical kinetic energy consists of vibrational,
rotational and translational parts given by 2T = SIGMA(k) P(k)2 +
SIGMA(alphabeta) omega(alpha)I(alphabeta)'omega(beta) + 1/M P2.
The rotational part contains the angular velocity omega and the
modified moment of inertia tensor I' of Wilson and Howard, which also
occurs in the relation J(alpha) - pi(alpha) =
SIGMA(beta)I(alphabeta)omega(beta)' involving the total (J) and
vibrational (pi) angular momenta. In case (i), I' has a vanishing z row
and column, where z is the axis of the molecule. This is associated with
the Sayvetz condition that the total angular momentum about the axis is
purely vibrational. These equations therefore contain only the two
components omega(x) and omega(y) of omega, which can be eliminated to
give the Hamiltonian form of the kinetic energy. In case (ii), the z
row and column of the I' matrix are non-vanishing and I' is
non-singular. The three components of omega can therefore be obtained in
terms of the angular momenta, to give a treatment that is entirely
analogous to that for a nonlinear reference configuration. The
parameters of the case (ii) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of those
of case (i).},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {73-79},
Abstract = {We consider six possible sources of CH4 and other lowmass (C-2-C-5)
   organics in the plume of Enceladus: three of these sources represent
   initial endowments of organics: cometary organics, Titan-like tholin,
   and the Fisher-Tropsch type reactions in the gases from which Enceladus
   formed. The other three sources represent processes inside Enceladus:
   water-rock reactions, microbiology, and thermogenesis. We report on new
   laboratory results for C-2 hydrocarbons released by thermogenesis of
   laboratory tholin and the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis. Thermal
   processing of Titan-like tholin produced ratios of CH4/C2H4 and CH4/C2H6
   of about two for temperatures up to 450 degrees C and about six for a
   temperature of 650 degrees C. The low pressure (similar to 1 atm)
   Fisher-Tropsch type experiments produced CH4/C2H4 of similar to 1.5,
   similar to previous results. C2H2 was not produced by either process.
   Tests of gas production by four strains of methanogens confirmed the
   absence of any detectable production of non-methane hydrocarbons.
   Cometary endowment, the Fisher-Tropsch type synthesis, and Titan-like
   tholin incorporation could be primary inputs of organics and subsequent
   thermal processing of any of these all are possible sources of low mass
   organics in the plume. Biological production and water-rock reactions
   are an alternative source of CH4. Aqueous reactions with CO and H-2 can
   produce C-2-C-5 organics even at the low pressures of the interior of
   Enceladus. If there is a confirmed detection of CO and C2H2 in the plume
   of Enceladus, this provides an important constraint on sources, as we
   have identified no process, other than the initial volatile component of
   cometary organics, which can supply these gases. Precise determination
   of the relative concentrations of C-1-C-5 hydrocarbons may provide
   additional constraints on sources, but a detailed isotopic analysis of C
   and H in these organics and a search for amino acids constitute the next
   important steps in resolving the sources of the organics in Enceladus'
   plume. },

Abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional photochemical and thermochemical

   we compare the model results with existing transit and eclipse
   observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular
   constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching
   and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b; however, the
   warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain
   thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are
   found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few
   bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and
   NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium
   chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons

   OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N-2, and CO2 more closely follow
   their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures less than or similar to
   1 mu bar, where CO, H2O, and N-2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2
   is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced

Abstract = {We present an analysis of the Spitzer IRS spectrum of the
   proto-planetary nebula SMP LMC II. This spectrum displays unusually
   strong absorption bands from cool, carbon-rich gas, including benzene
   (C6H6), (poly)acetylenes (C2H2, C4H2 and C6H2), HC3N, and propyne
   (CH3C2H); HCN on the other hand is at best marginally present. We derive
   column densities and temperatures by modelling the molecular absorption.
   While the relative abundances of the polyacetylenes are consistent with
   chemical models for the outer envelopes of evolved carbon stars, those
   for HC3N and HCN are not. It is not clear whether the presence of
   benzene indicates an efficient means of formation, or instead a
   protective environment that inhibits photo-destruction.},

Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope
   of six carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the
   Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) and two foreground
   Galactic carbon stars. The band strengths of the observed C(2)H(2) and
   SiC features are very similar to those observed in Galactic AGB stars.
   The metallicities are estimated from an empirical relation between the
   acetylene optical depth and the strength of the SiC feature. The
   metallicities are higher than those of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and
   close to Galactic values. While the high metallicity could imply an age
   of around 1 Gyr, for the dusty AGB stars, the pulsation periods suggest
   ages in excess of 2 or 3 Gyr. We fit the spectra of the observed stars
   using the DUSTY radiative transfer model and determine their dust
   mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0-3.3 x 10(-8) M(circle dot)
   yr(-1). The two Galactic foreground carbon-rich AGB stars are located at
   the far side of the solar circle, beyond the Galactic Centre. One of
   these two stars shows the strongest SiC feature in our present Local

Journal = {ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF THE BIOSPHERE},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {477-487},
Abstract = {Methane and other larger hydrocarbons have been proposed as possible
   greenhouse gases on early Mars. In this work we explore if volcanic
   processes may have been a source for such molecules based on theoretical
   and experimental considerations. Geologic evidence and numerical
   simulations indicate that explosive volcanism was widely distributed
   throughout Mars. Volcanic lightning is typically produced in such
   explosive volcanism. Therefore this geologic setting was studied to
   determine if lightning could be a source for hydrocarbons in volcanic
   plumes. Volcanic lightning was simulated by focusing a high-energy
   infrared laser beam inside of a Pyrex reactor that contained the
   proposed volcanic gas mixture composed of 64\% CH4, 24\% H-2, 10\% H2O
   and 2\% N-2, according to an accretion model and the nitrogen content
   measured in Martian meteorites. The analysis of products was performed
   by gas chromatography coupled to infrared and mass spectroscopy. Eleven
   hydrocarbons were identified among the products, of which acetylene
   (C2H2) was the most abundant. A thermochemical model was used to
   determine which hydrocarbons could arise only from volcanic heat. In
   this case, acetylene and ethylene are formed at magmatic temperatures.
   Our results indicate that explosive volcanism may have injected into the
   atmosphere of early Mars similar to 6 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of acetylene,
   and similar to 2 x 10(12) g yr(-1) of 1,3-butadiyne, both produced by
   volcanic lightning, similar to 5 x 10(11) g yr(-1) of ethylene produced
   by volcanic heat, and 10(13) g yr(-1) of methane.},

Title = {{Three-micron spectra of AGB stars and supergiants in nearby galaxies}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2005},
Volume = {434},
Pages = {691-706},
Abstract = {The dependence of stellar molecular bands on the metallicity is studied
   using infrared L- band spectra of AGB stars ( both carbon- rich and
   oxygen- rich) and M- type supergiants in the Large and Small Magellanic
   Clouds ( LMC and SMC) and in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
   The spectra cover SiO bands for oxygen- rich stars, and acetylene (
   C2H2), CH and HCN bands for carbon- rich AGB stars. The equivalent width
   of acetylene is found to be high even at low metallicity. The high C2H2
   abundance can be explained with a high carbon- to- oxygen ( C/ O) ratio
   for lower metallicity carbon stars. In contrast, the HCN equivalent
   width is low: fewer than half of the extra- galactic carbon stars show
   the 3.5 $\mu$m HCN band, and only a few LMC stars show high HCN equivalent
   width. HCN abundances are limited by both nitrogen and carbon elemental
   abundances. The amount of synthesized nitrogen depends on the initial
   mass, and stars with high luminosity ( i. e. high initial mass) could
   have a high HCN abundance. CH bands are found in both the extra-
   galactic and Galactic carbon stars. One SMC post- AGB star, SMC- S2,
   shows the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH band. This first detection of a PAH band from an
   SMC post- AGB star confirms PAHs can form in these low- metallicity
   stars. None of the oxygen- rich LMC stars show SiO bands, except one
   possible detection in a low quality spectrum. The limits on the
   equivalent widths of the SiO bands are below the expectation of up to 30
   angstrom for LMC metallicity. Several possible explanations are
   discussed, mostly based on the effect of pulsation and circumstellar
   dust. The observations imply that LMC and SMC carbon stars could reach
   mass- loss rates as high as their Galactic counterparts, because there
   are more carbon atoms available and more carbonaceous dust can be
   formed. On the other hand, the lack of SiO suggests less dust and lower
   mass- loss rates in low- metallicity oxygen- rich stars. The effect on
   the ISM dust enrichment is discussed.},

Abstract = {The strong interactions of shock waves caused by stellar pulsation, the

   this paper we present dynamic model atmospheres of long-period variables

   importance of using reasonable mean gas opacities in grey dynamic
   models. Most topics discussed in this paper concern both C- and O-rich
   atmospheres but the quantitative results are mainly based on C-rich
   models. Synthetic spectra resulting from selected C- and O-rich models

    abstract = {We present a Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopic survey of
    mass-losing carbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the Large Magellanic
    Cloud (LMC). The stars represent the superwind phase on the asymptotic giant
    branch (AGB), which forms a major source of dust for the interstellar medium
    (ISM) in galaxies. Bolometric magnitudes indicate progenitor masses of 1.5-2.5Msolar.
    The spectra cover the wavelength range 5-38µm. They show varying combinations
    of dust continuum, dust emission features (SiC, MgS) and molecular absorption
    bands (C2H2, HCN). A 10-µm absorption feature is attributed to C3. A weak band
    at 5.8µm is suggestive of carbonyl. The circumstellar 7.5-µm C2H2 band is found
    to be stronger at lower metallicity, explained by higher C/O ratios at low
    metallicity. The J - K versus K - A colours, used to select the sample, are
    shown to be relatively insensitive in separating carbon versus oxygen-rich
    AGB stars. The predominance of carbon stars therefore indicates that in the
    range 1.5-2.5Msolar, LMC AGB stars become carbon-rich before onset of the superwind.
    A set of four narrow bands, dubbed the Manchester system, is used to define
    the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. We investigate the strength
    and central wavelength of the SiC and MgS dust bands as a function of colour
    and metallicity. The line-to-continuum ratio of these bands shows some
    indication of being lower at low metallicity. The MgS band is only seen at
    dust temperatures below 600K. Metal-poor carbon stars can form amorphous
    carbon dust from self-produced carbon. The formation efficiency of oxygen-rich
    dust depends more strongly on metallicity. In lower-metallicity environments,
    the dust input into the ISM by AGB stars may be strongly biased towards
    carbonaceous dust. },

  abstract={We report on the detection with the Infrared Space Observatory ( ISO ), for the first time in the circumstellar medium, of the polyacetylenic chains C 4 H 2 and C 6 H 2 and of benzene (C 6 H 6 ) in the direction of the proto-planetary nebula CRL 618. Surprisingly, the abundances of di- and triacetylene are only a factor of 2-4 lower than that of C 2 H 2 . Benzene is [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 40 times less abundant than acetylene. We suggest that the chemistry in CRL 618 has been strongly modified by the UV photons coming from the hot central star and by the shocks associated with its high-velocity winds. All the infrared bands arise from a region with kinetic temperatures between 200 and 250 K, probably the photodissociation region associated with the dense torus that surrounds the central star. C 4 H 2 and C 6 H 2 have also been detected in CRL 2688, so it seems that C-rich proto-planetary nebulae are the best organic chemistry factories in space.}

I identify three problems one confronts (1) reducing the size of the basis; (2) computing hundreds of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large matrix; (3) calculating matrix elements of the potential, and present ideas that mitigate them. Most modern methods use a combination of these ideas. I divide popular methods into groups based on the strategies used to deal with the three problems. }
