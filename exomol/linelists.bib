abstract = "Abstract Knowledge of intensities of rovibrational transitions of various molecules and theirs isotopic species in wide spectral and temperature ranges is essential for the modeling of optical properties of planetary atmospheres, brown dwarfs and for other astrophysical applications. TheoReTS (“Theoretical Reims–Tomsk Spectral data”) is an Internet accessible information system devoted to ab initio based rotationally resolved spectra predictions for some relevant molecular species. All data were generated from potential energy and dipole moment surfaces computed via high-level electronic structure calculations using variational methods for vibration–rotation energy levels and transitions. When available, empirical corrections to band centers were applied, all line intensities remaining purely ab initio. The current TheoReTS implementation contains information on four-to-six atomic molecules, including phosphine, methane, ethylene, silane, methyl-fluoride, and their isotopic species 13 \{CH\} 4 , 12 \{CH\} 3 D , 12 \{CH\} 2 D 2 , 12 \{CD\} 4 , 13 C 2 H 4 , … . Predicted hot methane line lists up to T = 2000 K are included. The information system provides the associated software for spectra simulation including absorption coefficient, absorption and emission cross-sections, transmittance and radiance. The simulations allow Lorentz, Gauss and Voight line shapes. Rectangular, triangular, Lorentzian, Gaussian, sinc and sinc squared apparatus function can be used with user-defined specifications for broadening parameters and spectral resolution. All information is organized as a relational database with the user-friendly graphical interface according to Model-View-Controller architectural tools. The full-featured web application is written on \{PHP\} using Yii framework and C++ software modules. In case of very large high-temperature line lists, a data compression is implemented for fast interactive spectra simulations of a quasi-continual absorption due to big line density. Applications for the TheoReTS may include: education/training in molecular absorption/emission, radiative and non-LTE processes, spectroscopic applications, opacity calculations for planetary and astrophysical applications. The system is freely accessible via internet on the two mirror sites: in Reims, France (http://theorets.univ-reims.fr) and in Tomsk, Russia (http://theorets.tsu.ru). "

Title = {{A full-spectrum k-distribution look-up table for radiative transfer in
   nonhomogeneous gaseous media}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {46-56},
Abstract = {{A full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) look-up table has been constructed
   for gas mixtures within a certain range of thermodynamic states for
   three species, i.e., CO2, H2O and CO. The k-distribution of a mixture is
   assembled directly from the summation of the linear absorption
   coefficients of three species. The systematic approach to generate the
   table, including the generation of the pressure-based absorption
   coefficient and the generation of the k-distribution, is discussed. To
   efficiently obtain accurate k-values for arbitrary thermodynamic states
   from tabulated values, a 6-D linear interpolation method is employed. A
   large number of radiative heat transfer calculations have been carried
   out to test the accuracy of the FSK look-up table. Results show that,
   using the FSK look-up table can provide excellent accuracy compared to
   the exact results. Without the time-consuming process of assembling
   k-distribution from individual species plus mixing, using the FSK
   look-up table can save considerable computational cost. To evaluate the
   accuracy as well as the efficiency of the FSK look-up table, radiative
   heat transfer via a scaled Sandia D Flame is calculated to compare the
   CPU execution time using the FSK method based on the narrow-band
   database, correlations, and the look-up table. Results show that the FSK
   look-up table can provide a computationally cheap alternative without
   much sacrifice in accuracy.}},

   sharp spectral features, while also realizing that atmospheric
   broadening typically limits line widths to 0.1 cm(-1). Calculated
   positional (wave-number, cm(-1)) uncertainty is less than or equal
   to0.005 cm(-1), while the 1sigma, statistical uncertainty in absorbance
   values is <2\% for most compounds. The latter was achieved by measuring
   multiple (typically 9) path length-concentration burdens and fitting a
   weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
   include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12
   samples. Though these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption
   strengths, and vapor pressures, the data agree to within experimental
   uncertainties with only one exception.},

Combust. Inst., vol. 31, 2007, pp. 2573–2580) up to about 1000 K for nine fuels commonly encountered in fire applications, namely methane, methanol, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, heptane, methyl methacrylate and toluene. These \{NB\} parameters can be used to generate a database of \{NB\} k-distributions of these fuels in order to apply the k-distribution methods to model their contributions to radiative heat transfer. The accuracy of this \{NB\} database, the \{EM2C\} \{NB\} database for methane (Perrin and Soufiani, JQSRT, vol. 103, 2007, pp. 3–13), and \{HITRAN\} 2012 for methane, methanol, ethane, and ethylene is assessed by comparison with the measured medium resolution transmissivities and spectrally-integrated radiative properties. Results show that the \{EM2C\} database is the most accurate for methane over the entire range of the temperature and the fuel partial pressure path length considered. The line parameters in \{HITRAN\} 2012 are not available for some important bands of methanol, ethane and ethylene and this spectroscopic database cannot be used with confidence above 600 K. The Malkmus narrow band database derived in the present study is found to reproduce spectrally-integrated radiative properties with error less than 20\%, which suggests that it can be used for engineering applications. Finally, applications to radiation calculations along lines of sight with methane concentrations and temperatures representative of pool fires show that both the present Malkmus narrow band and the \{NIST\} databases can predict accurately the radiative intensity for small scale pool fires where as discrepancies of the order of 30\% are expected in the case of methane pool fires with a heat release rate of 176 kW.}}

   cyanide (CN), and titanium monoxide (TiO) are accurately computed. Line
   strength tables are used to describe the radiative transitions of
   diatomic molecules primarily in the visible, optical region. Details are
   elaborated of the computational procedure that allows one to utilize
   diatomic spectra as a predictive and as a diagnostic tool. In order to
   create a computed spectrum, the procedure requires information regarding
   the temperature of the diatomic transitions along with other input such
   as the spectral resolution. When combined with a fitting algorithm to
   optimize such parameters, this procedure is used to infer information
   from an experimentally obtained spectrum. Furthermore, the programs and
   data files are provided for LIBS investigations that also reveal MO,
   C-2, CN, and TiO diatomic spectra.}},

	transitions of importance in the atmospheres of exoplanets. These
	data will be widely applicable to other problems and will be used
	for studies on cool stars, brown dwarfs and circumstellar environments.
	This paper lays out the scientific foundations of this project and
	reviews previous work in this area. A mixture of first principles
	and empirically tuned quantum mechanical methods will be used to
	compute comprehensive and very large rotationvibration and rotationvibrationelectronic
	line lists. Methodologies will be developed for treating larger molecules
	such as methane and nitric acid. ExoMol will rely on these developments
	and the use of state-of-the-art computing.},

Abstract = {{Vienna atomic line database (VALD) is a collection of critically
   evaluated laboratory parameters for individual atomic transitions,
   complemented by theoretical calculations. VALD is actively used by
   astronomers for stellar spectroscopic studies-model atmosphere
   calculations, atmospheric parameter determinations, abundance analysis
   etc. The two first VALD releases contained parameters for atomic
   transitions only. In a major upgrade of VALD-VALD3, publically available
   from spring 2014, atomic data was complemented with parameters of
   molecular lines. The diatomic molecules C-2, CH, CN, CO, OH, MgH, SiH,
   TiO are now included. For each transition VALD provides species name,
   wavelength, energy, quantum number J and Lande-factor of the lower and
   upper levels, radiative, Stark and van der Waals damping factors and a
   full description of electronic configurarion and term information of
   both levels. Compared to the previous versions we have revised and
   verify all of the existing data and added new measurements and
   calculations for transitions in the range between 20 angstrom and 200
   microns. All transitions were complemented with term designations in a
   consistent way and electron configurations when available. All data were
   checked for consistency: listed wavelength versus Ritz, selection rules
   etc. A new bibliographic system keeps track of literature references for
   each parameter in a given transition throughout the merging process so
   that every selected data entry can be traced to the original source. The
   query language and the extraction tools can now handle various units,
   vacuum and air wavelengths. In the upgrade process we had an intensive
   interaction with data producers, which was very helpful for improving
   the quality of the VALD content.}},

Title = {{Complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium: IRAM 30 m line survey of Sagittarius B2(N) and (M)}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {559},
Pages = {A47},
Abstract = {Context. The discovery of amino acids in meteorites fallen to Earth
and the detection of glycine, the simplest of them, in samples returned from a
comet to Earth strongly suggest that the chemistry of the interstellar medium is
capable of producing such complex organic molecules and that they may be widespread in our Galaxy.
Aims. Our goal is to investigate the degree of chemical complexity that can be
reached in the interstellar medium, in particular in dense star-forming regions.
Methods. We performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward Sgr B2(N) and (M),
two regions where high-mass stars are formed, with the IRAM 30 m telescope in
the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window. Partial surveys at 2 and 1.3 mm were
performed in parallel. The spectra were analyzed with a simple radiative transfer
model that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium but takes optical depth effects
into account. Results. About 3675 and 945 spectral lines with a peak signal-to-noise
ratio higher than 4 are detected at 3 mm toward Sgr B2(N) and (M), i.e. about 102
and 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This represents an increase by about a factor
of two over previous surveys of Sgr B2. About 70% and 47% of the lines detected
toward Sgr B2(N) and (M) are identified and assigned to 56 and 46 distinct molecules
as well as to 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these molecules, respectively.
In addition, we report the detection of transitions from 59 and 24 catalog entries
corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited states of some of these molecules,
respectively, up to a vibration energy of 1400 cm-1 (2000 K). Excitation temperatures
and column densities were derived for each species but should be used with caution.
The rotation temperatures of the detected complex molecules typically range from ~50
to 200 K. Among the detected molecules, aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl cyanide, and
ethyl formate were reported for the first time in space based on this survey, as
were five rare isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide.
We also report the detection of transitions from within twelve new vibrationally
or torsionally excited states of known molecules. Absorption features produced by
diffuse clouds along the line of sight are detected in transitions with low rotation
quantum numbers of many simple molecules and are modeled with ~30–40 velocity components
with typical linewidths of ~3–5 km s-1. Conclusions. Although the large number of
unidentified lines may still allow future identification of new molecules, we
expect most of these lines to belong to vibrationally or torsionally excited states
or to rare isotopologues of known molecules for which spectroscopic predictions
are currently missing. Significant progress in extending the inventory of complex
organic molecules in Sgr B2(N) and deriving tighter constraints on their location,
origin, and abundance is expected in the near future thanks to an ongoing spectral
line survey at 3 mm with ALMA in its cycles 0 and 1. The present single-dish survey
will serve as a solid basis for the line identification and analysis of such an
interferometric survey.},

An overview of the 480 to 1902 GHz range}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {556},
Pages = {A57},
Abstract = {Context. Broadband spectral surveys of protostars offer a rich view
of the physical, chemical and dynamical structure and evolution of star-forming
regions. The Herschel Space Observatory opened up the terahertz regime to such
surveys, giving access to the fundamental transitions of many hydrides and to the
high-energy transitions of many other species. Aims. A comparative analysis of
the chemical inventories and physical processes and properties of protostars of
various masses and evolutionary states is the goal of the Herschel  CHEmical Surveys
of Star forming regions (CHESS) key program. This paper focusses on the
intermediate-mass protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4. Methods. We obtained a spectrum of OMC-2
FIR 4 in the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel 
and carried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the
line profile components, excitation, and cooling. Results. We detect 719 spectral
lines from 40 species and isotopologs. The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O,
and CH3OH. The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level
energy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component likely
due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud. Conclusions. We find abundant evidence
for warm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view. Line flux
represents 2% of the 7  L⊙ luminosity detected with HIFI in the 480 to 1250 GHz
range. Of the total line flux, 60% is from CO, 13% from H2O and 9% from CH3OH.
A comparison with similar HIFI spectra of other sources is set to provide much
new insight into star formation regions, a case in point being a difference of
two orders of magnitude in the relative contribution of sulphur oxides to the
line cooling of Orion KL and OMC-2 FIR 4.},

Abstract = {The Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is an
airborne observatory consisting of a specially modified Boeing 747SP with a 2.7 m telescope,
flying at altitudes as high as 13.7 km (45,000 ft). Designed to observe at wavelengths
from 0.3 μm to 1.6 mm, SOFIA operates above 99.8% of the water vapor that obscures much
of the infrared and submillimeter. SOFIA has seven science instruments under development,
including an occultation photometer, near-, mid-, and far-infrared cameras, infrared
spectrometers, and heterodyne receivers. SOFIA, a joint project between NASA and the
German Aerospace Center Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und-Raumfahrt, began initial science
flights in 2010 December, and has conducted 30 science flights in the subsequent year.
During this early science period three instruments have flown: the mid-infrared
camera FORCAST, the heterodyne spectrometer GREAT, and the occultation photometer HIPO.
This Letter provides an overview of the observatory and its early performance.},

Title = {{HELIOS-K}: AN ULTRAFAST, OPEN-SOURCE OPACITY CALCULATOR FOR RADIATIVE
   TRANSFER},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{808}},
Abstract = {{We present an ultrafast opacity calculator that we name HELIOS-K. It
   takes a line list as an input, computes the shape of each spectral line,
   and provides an option for grouping an enormous number of lines into a
   manageable number of bins. We implement a combination of Algorithm 916
   and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to compute the Voigt profile, write the
   code in CUDA, and optimize the computation for graphics processing units
   (GPUs). We restate the theory of the k-distribution method and use it to
   reduce similar to 10(5)-10(8) lines to similar to 10-10(4) wavenumber
   bins, which may then be used for radiative transfer, atmospheric
   retrieval and general circulation models. The choice of line-wing cutoff
   for the Voigt profile is a significant source of error and affects the
   value of the computed flux by similar to 10\%. This is an outstanding
   physical (rather than computational) problem, due to our incomplete
   knowledge of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the far line
   wings. We emphasize that this problem remains regardless of whether one
   performs line-by-line calculations or uses the k-distribution method and
   affects all calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres requiring the use
   of wavelength-dependent opacities. We elucidate the correlated-k
   approximation and demonstrate that it applies equally to inhomogeneous
   atmospheres with a single atomic/molecular species or homogeneous
   atmospheres with multiple species. Using a NVIDIA K20 GPU, HELIOS-K is
   capable of computing an opacity function with similar to 10(5) spectral
   lines in similar to 1 s and is publicly available as part of the
   Exoclimes Simulation Platform (www.exoclime.org).}},
