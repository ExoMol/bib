    abstract = {The HITRAN database is a compilation of molecular spectroscopic parameters. It was established in the early 1970s and is used by various computer codes to predict and simulate the transmission and emission of light in gaseous media (with an emphasis on terrestrial and planetary atmospheres). The HITRAN compilation is composed of five major components: the line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, experimental infrared absorption cross-sections (for molecules where it is not yet feasible for representation in a line-by-line form), collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables (including partition sums) that apply globally to the data. This paper describes the contents of the 2020 quadrennial edition of HITRAN. The HITRAN2020 edition takes advantage of recent experimental and theoretical data that were meticulously validated, in particular, against laboratory and atmospheric spectra. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2016 (including its updates during the intervening years). All five components of HITRAN have undergone major updates. In particular, the extent of the updates in the HITRAN2020 edition range from updating a few lines of specific molecules to complete replacements of the lists, and also the introduction of additional isotopologues and new (to HITRAN) molecules: SO, CH3F, GeH4, CS2, CH3I and NF3. Many new vibrational bands were added, extending the spectral coverage and completeness of the line lists. Also, the accuracy of the parameters for major atmospheric absorbers has been increased substantially, often featuring sub-percent uncertainties. Broadening parameters associated with water vaporÔÇÖs ambient pressure were introduced to HITRAN for the first time and are now available for several molecules. The HITRAN2020 edition continues to take advantage of the relational structure and efficient interface available at www.hitran.org and the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI). The functionality of both tools has been extended for the new edition.}

    ABSTRACT = {The application described has been designed to create bibliographic entries in large databases with diverse sources automatically, which reduces both the frequency of mistakes and the workload for the administrators. This new system uniquely identifies each reference from its digital object identifier (DOI) and retrieves the corresponding bibliographic information from any of several online services, including the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data Systems (ADS) and CrossRef APIs. Once parsed into a relational database, the software is able to produce bibliographies in any of several formats, including HTML and BibTeX, for use on websites or printed articles. The application is provided free-of-charge for general use by any scientific database. The power of this application is demonstrated when used to populate reference data for the HITRAN and AMBDAS databases as test cases. HITRAN contains data that is provided by researchers and collaborators throughout the spectroscopic community. These contributors are accredited for their contributions through the bibliography produced alongside the data returned by an online search in HITRAN. Prior to the work presented here, HITRAN and AMBDAS created these bibliographies manually, which is a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone process. The complete code for the new referencing system can be found on the HITRANonline GitHub website.},

To allow for these calculations to be performed, new high-accuracy potential energy curves, which include the diagonal BornÃ¢â‚¬â€œOppenheimer adiabatic corrections and the leading relativistic corrections, are determined. Also, a new approach for calculating non-adiabatic corrections involving an effective vibrational nuclear mass obtained based on the atoms-in-molecules theory is employed. The vibrational and rotational masses are taken as being different and dependent on the nuclear distance. Accurate dipole moment curves are calculated and used to generate lists of Einstein A-coefficients. The energy linelists and the sets of Einstein A-coefficients for HD are upgrades of previous calculations including quasibound states, while for HD+ and HeH+ and its isotopologues the present results represent significant improvement over the previous calculations. The results obtained here suggest that, with the inclusion of the non-adiabatic corrections, the accuracy limit at least for low-lying states might have been reached. Thus, further progress should involve accounting for even smaller effects such as the quantum-electrodynamics corrections. The present results represent the state-of-the-art of theoretical spectroscopy of the primordial polar molecules.}

Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {46-56},
Abstract = {{A full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) look-up table has been constructed
   for gas mixtures within a certain range of thermodynamic states for
   three species, i.e., CO2, H2O and CO. The k-distribution of a mixture is
   assembled directly from the summation of the linear absorption
   coefficients of three species. The systematic approach to generate the
   table, including the generation of the pressure-based absorption
   coefficient and the generation of the k-distribution, is discussed. To
   efficiently obtain accurate k-values for arbitrary thermodynamic states
   from tabulated values, a 6-D linear interpolation method is employed. A
   large number of radiative heat transfer calculations have been carried
   out to test the accuracy of the FSK look-up table. Results show that,
   using the FSK look-up table can provide excellent accuracy compared to
   the exact results. Without the time-consuming process of assembling
   k-distribution from individual species plus mixing, using the FSK
   look-up table can save considerable computational cost. To evaluate the
   accuracy as well as the efficiency of the FSK look-up table, radiative
   heat transfer via a scaled Sandia D Flame is calculated to compare the
   CPU execution time using the FSK method based on the narrow-band
   database, correlations, and the look-up table. Results show that the FSK
   look-up table can provide a computationally cheap alternative without
   much sacrifice in accuracy.}},

Title = {{HELIOS-K}: AN ULTRAFAST, OPEN-SOURCE OPACITY CALCULATOR FOR RADIATIVE
   TRANSFER},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{808}},
Abstract = {{We present an ultrafast opacity calculator that we name HELIOS-K. It
   takes a line list as an input, computes the shape of each spectral line,
   and provides an option for grouping an enormous number of lines into a
   manageable number of bins. We implement a combination of Algorithm 916
   and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to compute the Voigt profile, write the
   code in CUDA, and optimize the computation for graphics processing units
   (GPUs). We restate the theory of the k-distribution method and use it to
   reduce similar to 10(5)-10(8) lines to similar to 10-10(4) wavenumber
   bins, which may then be used for radiative transfer, atmospheric
   retrieval and general circulation models. The choice of line-wing cutoff
   for the Voigt profile is a significant source of error and affects the
   value of the computed flux by similar to 10\%. This is an outstanding
   physical (rather than computational) problem, due to our incomplete
   knowledge of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the far line
   wings. We emphasize that this problem remains regardless of whether one
   performs line-by-line calculations or uses the k-distribution method and
   affects all calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres requiring the use
   of wavelength-dependent opacities. We elucidate the correlated-k
   approximation and demonstrate that it applies equally to inhomogeneous
   atmospheres with a single atomic/molecular species or homogeneous
   atmospheres with multiple species. Using a NVIDIA K20 GPU, HELIOS-K is
   capable of computing an opacity function with similar to 10(5) spectral
   lines in similar to 1 s and is publicly available as part of the
   Exoclimes Simulation Platform (www.exoclime.org).}},

Abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are each creating
   quantitative databases containing the vapor-phase infrared spectra of
   pure chemicals. The digital databases have been created with both
   laboratory and remote-sensing applications in mind. A spectral
   resolution of approximate to0.1 cm(-1) was selected to avoid degrading
   sharp spectral features, while also realizing that atmospheric
   broadening typically limits line widths to 0.1 cm(-1). Calculated
   positional (wave-number, cm(-1)) uncertainty is less than or equal
   to0.005 cm(-1), while the 1sigma, statistical uncertainty in absorbance
   values is <2\% for most compounds. The latter was achieved by measuring
   multiple (typically 9) path length-concentration burdens and fitting a
   weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
   include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12
   samples. Though these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption
   strengths, and vapor pressures, the data agree to within experimental
   uncertainties with only one exception.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the status circa 2001, of the HITRAN compilation
   that comprises the public edition available through 2001. The HITRAN
   compilation consists of several components useful for radiative transfer
   calculation codes: high-resolution spectroscopic parameters of molecules
   in the gas phase, absorption cross-sections for molecules with very
   dense spectral features, aerosol refractive indices, ultraviolet
   line-by-line parameters and absorption cross-sections, and associated
   database management software. The line-by-line portion of the database
   contains spectroscopic parameters for 38 molecules and their
   isotopologues and isotopomers suitable for calculating atmospheric
   transmission and radiance properties. Many more molecular species are
   presented in the infrared cross-section data than in the previous
   edition, especially the chlorofluorocarbons and their replacement gases.
   There is now sufficient representation so that quasi-quantitative
   simulations can be obtained with the standard radiance codes.
   In addition to the description and justification of new or modified data
   that have been incorporated since the last edition of HITRAN (1996),
   future modifications are indicated for cases considered to have a
   significant impact on remote-sensing experiments. },

Abstract = {Since its first publication in 1973, the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic
   database has been recognized as the international standard for providing
   the necessary fundamental spectroscopic parameters for diverse
   atmospheric and laboratory transmission and radiance calculations. There
   have been periodic editions of HITRAN over the past decades as the
   database has been expanded and improved with respect to the molecular
   species and spectral range covered, the number of parameters included,
   and the accuracy of this information. The 1996 edition not only includes
   the customary line-by-line transition parameters familiar to HITRAN
   users, but also cross-section data, aerosol indices of refraction,
   software to filter and manipulate the data, and documentation. This
   paper describes the data and features that have been added or replaced
   since the previous edition of HITRAN. We also cite instances of critical
   data that are forthcoming.},

   observed at high resolution (lambda/Delta/lambda similar to 300,000)
   with the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the McMath-Pierce solar
   telescope on Kitt Peak. When possible, solar observations at different
   air masses and on different days have allowed the less opaque telluric
   lines to be effectively removed from the program spectrum. The solar
   lines have been identified by searching the literature on atomic and
   molecular laboratory spectroscopy and when necessary by additional
   laboratory spectroscopy. Many new identifications have been made,
   including numerous SiO and hot water lines in the sunspot spectrum.},

    and dipole moment functions were carried out for C3 in its electronic ground state.
    The absorption coefficient between 0.7 and 75 microns is calculated on the basis
    of the vibrational band strength of transitions between the 800 lowest states
    with v less than or equal to (4, 39, 3). In cool carbon stars with a high C/O
    ratio, C3 is found to be the most prevalent of the known opacity sources.},
