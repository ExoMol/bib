abstract = {This paper describes the 2020 release of the GEISA database (Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques AtmosphÈriques: Management and Study of Atmospheric Spectroscopic Information), developed and maintained at LMD since 1974. GEISA is the reference database for several current or planned Thermal and Short-Wave InfraRed (TIR and SWIR) space missions IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer), IASI-NG (IASI New Generation), MicroCarb (Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission), Merlin (MEthane Remote sensing LIdar missioN). It is actually a compilation of three databases: the ìline parameters databaseî, the ìcross-section sub-databaseî and the ìmicrophysical and optical properties of atmospheric aerosols sub-databaseî. The new edition concerns only the line parameters dataset, with significant updates and additions implemented using the best available spectroscopic data. The GEISA-2020 line parameters database involves58 molecules (145 isotopic species)and contains 6,746,987 entries, in the spectral range from 10-6to 35877 cm-1. In this version, 23 molecules have been updated (with 10 new isotopic species) and 6 new molecules have been added (HONO, COFCl, CH3F, CH3I, RuO4, H2C3H2 (isomer of C3H4)) corresponding to 15 isotopic species. The compilation can be accessed through the AERIS data and services center for the atmosphere website (https://geisa.aeris-data.fr/), with the development of a powerful graphical tool and convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data using modern technologies (PostgreSQL database, REST API, VueJS, Plotly). Based on four examples (H2O, O3, O2 and SF6), this paper also shows how the LMD in house validation algorithm SPARTE (Spectroscopic Parameters And Radiative Transfer Evaluation) helps to evaluate, correct, reject or defer the input of new spectroscopic data into GEISA and this, thanks to iterations with researchers from different communities (spectroscopy, radiative transfer).}

JOURNAL = {Atoms},
VOLUME = {8},
YEAR = {2020},
pages = {16},
ABSTRACT = {The application described has been designed to create bibliographic entries in large databases with diverse sources automatically, which reduces both the frequency of mistakes and the workload for the administrators. This new system uniquely identifies each reference from its digital object identifier (DOI) and retrieves the corresponding bibliographic information from any of several online services, including the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data Systems (ADS) and CrossRef APIs. Once parsed into a relational database, the software is able to produce bibliographies in any of several formats, including HTML and BibTeX, for use on websites or printed articles. The application is provided free-of-charge for general use by any scientific database. The power of this application is demonstrated when used to populate reference data for the HITRAN and AMBDAS databases as test cases. HITRAN contains data that is provided by researchers and collaborators throughout the spectroscopic community. These contributors are accredited for their contributions through the bibliography produced alongside the data returned by an online search in HITRAN. Prior to the work presented here, HITRAN and AMBDAS created these bibliographies manually, which is a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone process. The complete code for the new referencing system can be found on the HITRANonline GitHub website.},

To allow for these calculations to be performed, new high-accuracy potential energy curves, which include the diagonal Born√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄúOppenheimer adiabatic corrections and the leading relativistic corrections, are determined. Also, a new approach for calculating non-adiabatic corrections involving an effective vibrational nuclear mass obtained based on the atoms-in-molecules theory is employed. The vibrational and rotational masses are taken as being different and dependent on the nuclear distance. Accurate dipole moment curves are calculated and used to generate lists of Einstein A-coefficients. The energy linelists and the sets of Einstein A-coefficients for HD are upgrades of previous calculations including quasibound states, while for HD+ and HeH+ and its isotopologues the present results represent significant improvement over the previous calculations. The results obtained here suggest that, with the inclusion of the non-adiabatic corrections, the accuracy limit at least for low-lying states might have been reached. Thus, further progress should involve accounting for even smaller effects such as the quantum-electrodynamics corrections. The present results represent the state-of-the-art of theoretical spectroscopy of the primordial polar molecules.}

abstract = {Abstract Infrared solar occultation measurements are well established for remote sensing of Earth√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s atmosphere, and the corresponding primary transit spectroscopy has turned out to be valuable for characterization of extrasolar planets. Our objective is an assessment of the detectability of molecular signatures in Earth√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s transit spectra. To this end, we take a limb sequence of representative cloud-free transmission spectra recorded by the space-borne ACE-FTS Earth observation mission (Hughes et√Ç¬†al., \{ACE\} infrared spectral atlases of the Earth√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s atmosphere, \{JQSRT\} 2014) and combine these spectra to the effective height of the atmosphere. These data are compared to spectra modeled with an atmospheric radiative transfer line-by-line infrared code to study the impact of individual molecules, spectral resolution, the choice of auxiliary data, and numerical approximations. Moreover, the study serves as a validation of our infrared radiative transfer code. The largest impact is due to water, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen, nitric acid, oxygen, and some chlorofluorocarbons (CFC11 and CFC12). The effect of further molecules considered in the modeling is either marginal or absent. The best matching model has a mean residuum of 0.4√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞km and a maximum difference of 2√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞km to the measured effective height. For a quantitative estimate of visibility and detectability we consider the maximum change of the residual spectrum, the relative change of the residual norm, the additional transit depth, and signal-to-noise ratios for a \{JWST\} setup. In conclusion, our study provides a list of molecules that are relevant for modeling transmission spectra of Earth-like exoplanets and discusses the feasibility of retrieval. }

Title = {{Planetary Spectrum Generator: An accurate online radiative transfer
   suite for atmospheres, comets, small bodies and exoplanets}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {86-104},
Abstract = {{We have developed an online radiative-transfer suite
   (https://psg.gsfc.nasa.gov) applicable to a broad range of planetary
   objects (e.g., planets, moons, comets, asteroids, TNOs, KBOs,
   exoplanets). The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) can synthesize
   planetary spectra (atmospheres and surfaces) for a broad range of
   wavelengths (UV/Vis/near-IR/IR/far-IR/THz/sub-mm/Radio) from any
   observatory (e.g., JWST, ALMA, Keck, SOFIA), any orbiter (e.g., ExoMars,
   Juno), or any lander (e.g., MSL). This is achieved by combining several
   state-of-the-art radiative transfer models, spectroscopic databases and
   planetary databases (i.e., climatological and orbital). PSG has a 3D
   (three-dimensional) orbital calculator for most bodies in the solar
   system, and all confirmed exoplanets, while the radiative-transfer
   models can ingest billions of spectral signatures for hundreds of
   species from several spectroscopic repositories. It integrates the
   latest radiative-transfer and scattering methods in order to compute
   high resolution spectra via line-by-line calculations, and utilizes the
   efficient correlated-k method at moderate resolutions, while for
   computing cometary spectra, PSG handles non-LTE and LTE excitation
   processes. PSG includes a realistic noise calculator that integrates
   several telescope/instrument configurations (e.g., interferometry,
   coronagraphs) and detector technologies (e.g., CCD, heterodyne
   detectors, bolometers). Such an integration of advanced spectroscopic
   methods into an online tool can greatly serve the planetary community,
   ultimately enabling the retrieval of planetary parameters from remote
   sensing data, efficient mission planning strategies, interpretation of
   current and future planetary data, calibration of spectroscopic data,
   and development of new instrument/spacecraft concepts. }},

abstract = {A new collection of photodissociation and photoionisation cross
sections for 102 atoms and molecules of astrochemical interest has been assembled,
along with a brief review of the basic physical processes involved. These have been
used to calculate dissociation and ionisation rates, with uncertainties, in a
standard ultraviolet interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and for other wavelength-dependent
radiation fields, including cool stellar and solar radiation, Lyman-√é¬± dominated radiation,
and a cosmic-ray induced ultraviolet flux. The new ISRF rates generally agree within
30% with our previous compilations, with a few notable exceptions. Comparison with
other databases such as PHIDRATES is made. The reduction of rates in shielded regions
was calculated as a function of dust, molecular and atomic hydrogen, atomic C, and
self-shielding column densities. The relative importance of these shielding types
depends on the atom or molecule in question and the assumed dust optical properties.
All of the new data are publicly available from the Leiden photodissociation and
ionisation database. Sensitivity of the calculated rates to variation of temperature
and isotope, and uncertainties in measured or calculated cross sections, are tested
and discussed. Tests were conducted on the new rates with an interstellar-cloud
chemical model, and find general agreement (within a factor of two) in abundances
obtained with the previous iteration of the Leiden database assuming an ISRF, and
order-of-magnitude variations assuming various kinds of stellar radiation. The
newly parameterised dust-shielding factors makes a factor-of-two difference to
many atomic and molecular abundances relative to parameters currently in the UDfA
and KIDA astrochemical reaction databases. The newly-calculated cosmic-ray induced
photodissociation and ionisation rates differ from current standard values up to a
factor of 5. Under high temperature and cosmic-ray-flux conditions the new rates
alter the equilibrium abundances of abundant dark cloud abundances by up to a factor
of two. The partial cross sections for H2O and NH3 photodissociation forming
OH, O, NH2 and NH are also evaluated and lead to radiation-field-dependent
branching ratios. },

This paper presents the 2015 release of \{GEISA\} (GEISA-2015), which updates the last edition of 2011 and celebrates the 40th anniversary of the database. Significant updates and additions have been implemented in the three following independent databases of GEISA. The √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúline parameters database√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù contains 52 molecular species (113 isotopologues) and transitions in the spectral range from 10-6 to 35,877.031 cm-1, representing 5,059,777 entries, against 3,794,297 in GEISA-2011. Among the previously existing molecules, 20 molecular species have been updated. A new molecule (SO3) has been added. HDO, isotopologue of H2O, is now identified as an independent molecular species. Six new isotopologues have been added to the GEISA-2015 database. The √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúcross section sub-database√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù has been enriched by the addition of 43 new molecular species in its infrared part, 4 molecules (ethane, propane, acetone, acetonitrile) are also updated; they represent 3\% of the update. A new section is added, in the near-infrared spectral region, involving 7 molecular species: CH3CN, CH3I, CH3O2, H2CO, HO2, HONO, NH3. The √É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ö‚Äúmicrophysical and optical properties of atmospheric aerosols sub-database√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù has been updated for the first time since 2003.

Abstract = {{A full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) look-up table has been constructed
   for gas mixtures within a certain range of thermodynamic states for
   three species, i.e., CO2, H2O and CO. The k-distribution of a mixture is
   assembled directly from the summation of the linear absorption
   coefficients of three species. The systematic approach to generate the
   table, including the generation of the pressure-based absorption
   coefficient and the generation of the k-distribution, is discussed. To
   efficiently obtain accurate k-values for arbitrary thermodynamic states
   from tabulated values, a 6-D linear interpolation method is employed. A
   large number of radiative heat transfer calculations have been carried
   out to test the accuracy of the FSK look-up table. Results show that,
   using the FSK look-up table can provide excellent accuracy compared to
   the exact results. Without the time-consuming process of assembling
   k-distribution from individual species plus mixing, using the FSK
   look-up table can save considerable computational cost. To evaluate the
   accuracy as well as the efficiency of the FSK look-up table, radiative
   heat transfer via a scaled Sandia D Flame is calculated to compare the
   CPU execution time using the FSK method based on the narrow-band
   database, correlations, and the look-up table. Results show that the FSK
   look-up table can provide a computationally cheap alternative without
   much sacrifice in accuracy.}},

Title = {{HELIOS-K}: AN ULTRAFAST, OPEN-SOURCE OPACITY CALCULATOR FOR RADIATIVE
   TRANSFER},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{808}},
Abstract = {{We present an ultrafast opacity calculator that we name HELIOS-K. It
   takes a line list as an input, computes the shape of each spectral line,
   and provides an option for grouping an enormous number of lines into a
   manageable number of bins. We implement a combination of Algorithm 916
   and Gauss-Hermite quadrature to compute the Voigt profile, write the
   code in CUDA, and optimize the computation for graphics processing units
   (GPUs). We restate the theory of the k-distribution method and use it to
   reduce similar to 10(5)-10(8) lines to similar to 10-10(4) wavenumber
   bins, which may then be used for radiative transfer, atmospheric
   retrieval and general circulation models. The choice of line-wing cutoff
   for the Voigt profile is a significant source of error and affects the
   value of the computed flux by similar to 10\%. This is an outstanding
   physical (rather than computational) problem, due to our incomplete
   knowledge of pressure broadening of spectral lines in the far line
   wings. We emphasize that this problem remains regardless of whether one
   performs line-by-line calculations or uses the k-distribution method and
   affects all calculations of exoplanetary atmospheres requiring the use
   of wavelength-dependent opacities. We elucidate the correlated-k
   approximation and demonstrate that it applies equally to inhomogeneous
   atmospheres with a single atomic/molecular species or homogeneous
   atmospheres with multiple species. Using a NVIDIA K20 GPU, HELIOS-K is
   capable of computing an opacity function with similar to 10(5) spectral
   lines in similar to 1 s and is publicly available as part of the
   Exoclimes Simulation Platform (www.exoclime.org).}},

Journal = SCAB,
Year = {2015},
volume = {107},
Pages = {132-138},
Abstract = {Laser ablation studies with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)
   typically emphasize atomic species yet fingerprints from molecular
   species can occur subsequently or concurrently. In this work, selected
   molecular transitions of aluminum monixide (AlO), diatomic carbon (C-2),
   cyanide (CN), and titanium monoxide (TiO) are accurately computed. Line
   strength tables are used to describe the radiative transitions of
   diatomic molecules primarily in the visible, optical region. Details are
   elaborated of the computational procedure that allows one to utilize
   diatomic spectra as a predictive and as a diagnostic tool. In order to
   create a computed spectrum, the procedure requires information regarding
   the temperature of the diatomic transitions along with other input such
   as the spectral resolution. When combined with a fitting algorithm to
   optimize such parameters, this procedure is used to infer information
   from an experimentally obtained spectrum. Furthermore, the programs and
   data files are provided for LIBS investigations that also reveal MO,
   C-2, CN, and TiO diatomic spectra.},

Combust. Inst., vol. 31, 2007, pp. 2573√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2580) up to about 1000 K for nine fuels commonly encountered in fire applications, namely methane, methanol, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, heptane, methyl methacrylate and toluene. These \{NB\} parameters can be used to generate a database of \{NB\} k-distributions of these fuels in order to apply the k-distribution methods to model their contributions to radiative heat transfer. The accuracy of this \{NB\} database, the \{EM2C\} \{NB\} database for methane (Perrin and Soufiani, JQSRT, vol. 103, 2007, pp. 3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú13), and \{HITRAN\} 2012 for methane, methanol, ethane, and ethylene is assessed by comparison with the measured medium resolution transmissivities and spectrally-integrated radiative properties. Results show that the \{EM2C\} database is the most accurate for methane over the entire range of the temperature and the fuel partial pressure path length considered. The line parameters in \{HITRAN\} 2012 are not available for some important bands of methanol, ethane and ethylene and this spectroscopic database cannot be used with confidence above 600 K. The Malkmus narrow band database derived in the present study is found to reproduce spectrally-integrated radiative properties with error less than 20\%, which suggests that it can be used for engineering applications. Finally, applications to radiation calculations along lines of sight with methane concentrations and temperatures representative of pool fires show that both the present Malkmus narrow band and the \{NIST\} databases can predict accurately the radiative intensity for small scale pool fires where as discrepancies of the order of 30\% are expected in the case of methane pool fires with a heat release rate of 176 kW.}}

Title = {{A major upgrade of the VALD database}},
Journal = PS,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Abstract = {{Vienna atomic line database (VALD) is a collection of critically
   evaluated laboratory parameters for individual atomic transitions,
   complemented by theoretical calculations. VALD is actively used by
   astronomers for stellar spectroscopic studies-model atmosphere
   calculations, atmospheric parameter determinations, abundance analysis
   etc. The two first VALD releases contained parameters for atomic
   transitions only. In a major upgrade of VALD-VALD3, publically available
   from spring 2014, atomic data was complemented with parameters of
   molecular lines. The diatomic molecules C-2, CH, CN, CO, OH, MgH, SiH,
   TiO are now included. For each transition VALD provides species name,
   wavelength, energy, quantum number J and Lande-factor of the lower and
   upper levels, radiative, Stark and van der Waals damping factors and a
   full description of electronic configurarion and term information of
   both levels. Compared to the previous versions we have revised and
   verify all of the existing data and added new measurements and
   calculations for transitions in the range between 20 angstrom and 200
   microns. All transitions were complemented with term designations in a
   consistent way and electron configurations when available. All data were
   checked for consistency: listed wavelength versus Ritz, selection rules
   etc. A new bibliographic system keeps track of literature references for
   each parameter in a given transition throughout the merging process so
   that every selected data entry can be traced to the original source. The
   query language and the extraction tools can now handle various units,
   vacuum and air wavelengths. In the upgrade process we had an intensive
   interaction with data producers, which was very helpful for improving
   the quality of the VALD content.}},

Title = {{Complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium: IRAM 30 m line survey of Sagittarius B2(N) and (M)}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {2013},
Volume = {559},
Pages = {A47},
Abstract = {Context. The discovery of amino acids in meteorites fallen to Earth
and the detection of glycine, the simplest of them, in samples returned from a
comet to Earth strongly suggest that the chemistry of the interstellar medium is
capable of producing such complex organic molecules and that they may be widespread in our Galaxy.
Aims. Our goal is to investigate the degree of chemical complexity that can be
reached in the interstellar medium, in particular in dense star-forming regions.
Methods. We performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward Sgr B2(N) and (M),
two regions where high-mass stars are formed, with the IRAM 30 m telescope in
the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window. Partial surveys at 2 and 1.3 mm were
performed in parallel. The spectra were analyzed with a simple radiative transfer
model that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium but takes optical depth effects
into account. Results. About 3675 and 945 spectral lines with a peak signal-to-noise
ratio higher than 4 are detected at 3 mm toward Sgr B2(N) and (M), i.e. about 102
and 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This represents an increase by about a factor
of two over previous surveys of Sgr B2. About 70% and 47% of the lines detected
toward Sgr B2(N) and (M) are identified and assigned to 56 and 46 distinct molecules
as well as to 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these molecules, respectively.
In addition, we report the detection of transitions from 59 and 24 catalog entries
corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited states of some of these molecules,
respectively, up to a vibration energy of 1400 cm-1 (2000 K). Excitation temperatures
and column densities were derived for each species but should be used with caution.
The rotation temperatures of the detected complex molecules typically range from ~50
to 200 K. Among the detected molecules, aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl cyanide, and
ethyl formate were reported for the first time in space based on this survey, as
were five rare isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide.
We also report the detection of transitions from within twelve new vibrationally
or torsionally excited states of known molecules. Absorption features produced by
diffuse clouds along the line of sight are detected in transitions with low rotation
quantum numbers of many simple molecules and are modeled with ~30√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú40 velocity components
with typical linewidths of ~3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú5 km s-1. Conclusions. Although the large number of
unidentified lines may still allow future identification of new molecules, we
expect most of these lines to belong to vibrationally or torsionally excited states
or to rare isotopologues of known molecules for which spectroscopic predictions
are currently missing. Significant progress in extending the inventory of complex
organic molecules in Sgr B2(N) and deriving tighter constraints on their location,
origin, and abundance is expected in the near future thanks to an ongoing spectral
line survey at 3 mm with ALMA in its cycles 0 and 1. The present single-dish survey
will serve as a solid basis for the line identification and analysis of such an
interferometric survey.},

An overview of the 480 to 1902 GHz range}},
Journal = AA,

Abstract = {Context. Broadband spectral surveys of protostars offer a rich view
of the physical, chemical and dynamical structure and evolution of star-forming
regions. The Herschel Space Observatory opened up the terahertz regime to such
surveys, giving access to the fundamental transitions of many hydrides and to the
high-energy transitions of many other species. Aims. A comparative analysis of
the chemical inventories and physical processes and properties of protostars of
various masses and evolutionary states is the goal of the Herschel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞ CHEmical Surveys
of Star forming regions (CHESS) key program. This paper focusses on the
intermediate-mass protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4. Methods. We obtained a spectrum of OMC-2
FIR 4 in the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞
and carried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the
line profile components, excitation, and cooling. Results. We detect 719 spectral
lines from 40 species and isotopologs. The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O,
and CH3OH. The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level
energy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component likely
due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud. Conclusions. We find abundant evidence
for warm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view. Line flux
represents 2% of the 7  L√¢≈†‚Ñ¢ luminosity detected with HIFI in the 480 to 1250 GHz
range. Of the total line flux, 60% is from CO, 13% from H2O and 9% from CH3OH.
A comparison with similar HIFI spectra of other sources is set to provide much
new insight into star formation regions, a case in point being a difference of
two orders of magnitude in the relative contribution of sulphur oxides to the
line cooling of Orion KL and OMC-2 FIR 4.},

Abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are each creating
   quantitative databases containing the vapor-phase infrared spectra of
   pure chemicals. The digital databases have been created with both
   laboratory and remote-sensing applications in mind. A spectral
   resolution of approximate to0.1 cm(-1) was selected to avoid degrading
   sharp spectral features, while also realizing that atmospheric
   broadening typically limits line widths to 0.1 cm(-1). Calculated
   positional (wave-number, cm(-1)) uncertainty is less than or equal
   to0.005 cm(-1), while the 1sigma, statistical uncertainty in absorbance
   values is <2\% for most compounds. The latter was achieved by measuring
   multiple (typically 9) path length-concentration burdens and fitting a
   weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
   include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12
   samples. Though these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption
   strengths, and vapor pressures, the data agree to within experimental
   uncertainties with only one exception.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the status circa 2001, of the HITRAN compilation
   that comprises the public edition available through 2001. The HITRAN
   compilation consists of several components useful for radiative transfer
   calculation codes: high-resolution spectroscopic parameters of molecules
   in the gas phase, absorption cross-sections for molecules with very
   dense spectral features, aerosol refractive indices, ultraviolet
   line-by-line parameters and absorption cross-sections, and associated
   database management software. The line-by-line portion of the database
   contains spectroscopic parameters for 38 molecules and their
   isotopologues and isotopomers suitable for calculating atmospheric
   transmission and radiance properties. Many more molecular species are
   presented in the infrared cross-section data than in the previous
   edition, especially the chlorofluorocarbons and their replacement gases.
   There is now sufficient representation so that quasi-quantitative
   simulations can be obtained with the standard radiance codes.
   In addition to the description and justification of new or modified data
   that have been incorporated since the last edition of HITRAN (1996),
   future modifications are indicated for cases considered to have a
   significant impact on remote-sensing experiments. },

   database has been expanded and improved with respect to the molecular
   species and spectral range covered, the number of parameters included,
   and the accuracy of this information. The 1996 edition not only includes
   the customary line-by-line transition parameters familiar to HITRAN
   users, but also cross-section data, aerosol indices of refraction,
   software to filter and manipulate the data, and documentation. This
   paper describes the data and features that have been added or replaced
   since the previous edition of HITRAN. We also cite instances of critical
   data that are forthcoming.},

   with the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the McMath-Pierce solar
   telescope on Kitt Peak. When possible, solar observations at different
   air masses and on different days have allowed the less opaque telluric
   lines to be effectively removed from the program spectrum. The solar
   lines have been identified by searching the literature on atomic and
   molecular laboratory spectroscopy and when necessary by additional
   laboratory spectroscopy. Many new identifications have been made,
   including numerous SiO and hot water lines in the sunspot spectrum.},
