  abstract = {The discovery of extrasolar planets is one of the major scientific
	advances of the last two decades. Hundreds of planets have now been
	detected and astronomers are beginning to characterize their composition
	and physical characteristics. To do this requires a huge quantity
	of spectroscopic data most of which are not available from laboratory
	studies. The ExoMol project will offer a comprehensive solution to
	this problem by providing spectroscopic data on all the molecular
	transitions of importance in the atmospheres of exoplanets. These
	data will be widely applicable to other problems and will be used
	for studies on cool stars, brown dwarfs and circumstellar environments.
	This paper lays out the scientific foundations of this project and
	reviews previous work in this area. A mixture of first principles
	and empirically tuned quantum mechanical methods will be used to
	compute comprehensive and very large rotationvibration and rotationvibrationelectronic
	line lists. Methodologies will be developed for treating larger molecules
	such as methane and nitric acid. ExoMol will rely on these developments
	and the use of state-of-the-art computing.},

	ExoMol. This project will produce molecular line lists for all molecules
	considered to be important for the modelling atmospheres of exoplanets
	and cool stars, which are prerequisites for the spectroscopic characterization
	of the atmospheres of these astrophysical objects. Towards this end
	25 species are identified as key ones for meeting current demands

abstract = {Abstract The ExoMol database (www.exomol.com) provides extensive line lists of molecular transitions which are valid over extended temperature ranges. The status of the current release of the database is reviewed and a new data structure is specified. This structure augments the provision of energy levels (and hence transition frequencies) and Einstein A coefficients with other key properties, including lifetimes of individual states, temperature-dependent cooling functions, Landé g-factors, partition functions, cross sections, k-coefficients and transition dipoles with phase relations. Particular attention is paid to the treatment of pressure broadening parameters. The new data structure includes a definition file which provides the necessary information for utilities accessing ExoMol through its application programming interface (API). Prospects for the inclusion of new species into the database are discussed. }
