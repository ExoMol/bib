Title = {From the Automated Calculation of Potential Energy Surfaces to Accurate
   Infrared Spectra},
Journal = JPCL,
Year = {2024},
Abstract = {Advances in the development of quantum chemical methods and progress in
   multicore architectures in computer science made the simulation of
   infrared spectra of isolated molecules competitive with respect to
   established experimental methods. Although it is mainly the
   multidimensional potential energy surface that controls the accuracy of
   these calculations, the subsequent vibrational structure calculations
   need to be carefully converged in order to yield accurate results. As
   both aspects need to be considered in a balanced way, we focus on
   approaches for molecules of up to 12-15 atoms with respect to both
   parts, which have been automated to some extent so that they can be
   employed in routine applications. Alternatives to machine learning will
   be discussed, which appear to be attractive, as long as local regions of
   the potential energy surface are sufficient. The automatization of these
   methods is still in its infancy, and the generalization to molecules
   with large amplitude motions or molecular clusters is far from trivial,
   but many systems relevant for astrophysical studies are already in
   reach.},

Journal = JCTC,
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {7732-7744},
Abstract = {Methods for solving the Schrodinger equation without approximation are
   in high demand but are notoriously computationally expensive. In
   practical terms, there are just three primary factors that currently
   limit what can be achieved: 1) system size/dimensionality; 2) energy
   level excitation; and 3) numerical convergence accuracy. Broadly
   speaking, current methods can deliver on any two of these three goals,
   but achieving all three at once remains an enormous challenge. In this
   paper, we shall demonstrate how to ``hit the trifecta{''} in the context
   of molecular vibrational spectroscopy calculations. In particular, we
   compute the lowest 1000 vibrational states for the six-atom acetonitrile
   molecule (CH3CN), to a numerical convergence of accuracy 10(-2) cm(-1)
   or better. These calculations encompass all vibrational states
   throughout most of the dynamically relevant range (i.e., up to similar
   to 4250 cm(-1) above the ground state), computed in full quantum
   dimensionality (12 dimensions), to near spectroscopic accuracy. To our
   knowledge, no such vibrational spectroscopy calculation has ever
   previously been performed.},

RADIS is built around the HITRAN, HITEMP and CDSD databases for molecules in their electronic ground state. Energy levels are read from tabulated databases or calculated from Dunham expansions. Boltzmann, Treanor, and arbitrary vibrational distributions can be generated. In its present version, nonequilibrium spectra can be computed for CO2 and CO, and equilibrium spectra can be computed for all species of the HITRAN database. New species can be added without modification to the core code. Several optimization strategies are described that reduce computation times of high-temperature, high-resolution spectra with millions of lines down to less than a minute. Additionally, RADIS includes a line survey tool, a built-in look-up database to reduce convergence times when fitting experimental spectra, and a multi-slab module to simulate line-of-sight experiments. Validation cases against existing spectral codes and experimental results from various plasma sources are presented. Finally, RADIS is applied to improve the modeling of the radiation from a plasma torch and a nonequilibrium expansion-tube experiment. RADIS is distributed under LGPLv3 license [1].}

The approach is based on the property of the Hamiltonian operator to commute with the complete set of symmetry operators and, hence, to reflect the symmetry of the system. The symmetry-adapted ro-vibrational basis set is constructed numerically by solving a set of reduced vibrational eigenvalue problems. In order to assign the irreducible representations associated with these eigenfunctions, their symmetry properties are probed on a grid of molecular geometries with the corresponding symmetry operations. The transformation matrices are reconstructed by solving overdetermined systems of linear equations related to the transformation properties of the corresponding wave functions on the grid. Our method is implemented in the variational approach TROVE and has been successfully applied to many problems covering the most important molecular symmetry groups. Several examples are used to illustrate the procedure, which can be easily applied to different types of coordinates, basis sets, and molecular systems. }

Title = {{On the Mass of Atoms in Molecules: Beyond the Born-Oppenheimer
   Approximation}},
Journal = {Phys. Rev. X},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Describing the dynamics of nuclei in molecules requires a potential
   energy surface, which is traditionally provided by the Born-Oppenheimer
   or adiabatic approximation. However, we also need to assign masses to
   the nuclei. There, the Born-Oppenheimer picture does not account for the
   inertia of the electrons, and only bare nuclear masses are considered.
   Nowadays, experimental accuracy challenges the theoretical predictions
   of rotational and vibrational spectra and requires the participation of
   electrons in the internal motion of the molecule. More than 80 years
   after the original work of Born and Oppenheimer, this issue has still
   not been solved, in general. Here, we present a theoretical and
   numerical framework to address this problem in a general and rigorous
   way. Starting from the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear wave
   function, we include electronic effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer
   regime in a perturbative way via position-dependent corrections to the
   bare nuclear masses. This maintains an adiabaticlike point of view: The
   nuclear degrees of freedom feel the presence of the electrons via a
   single potential energy surface, whereas the inertia of electrons is
   accounted for and the total mass of the system is recovered. This
   constitutes a general framework for describing the mass acquired by slow
   degrees of freedom due to the inertia of light, bounded particles; thus,
   it is applicable not only in electron-nuclear systems but in light-heavy
   nuclei or ions as well. We illustrate this idea with a model of proton
   transfer, where the light particle is the proton and the heavy particles
   are the oxygen atoms to which the proton is bounded. Inclusion of the
   light-particle inertia allows us to gain orders of magnitude in
   accuracy. The electron-nuclear perspective is adopted, instead, to
   calculate position-dependent mass corrections using density functional
   theory for a few polyatomic molecules at their equilibrium geometry.
   These data can serve as input for the computation of high-precision
   molecular spectra.}},

   computing coefficients of a KEO. This is done by using a space-fixed KEO
   and computing KEO matrix elements numerically. Whenever one has an
   excellent basis, more accurate solutions to the Schrodinger equation can
   be obtained by computing the KEO, potential, and overlap matrix elements
   numerically. Using a Gaussian basis and bond coordinates, we compute
   vibrational energy levels of formaldehyde. We show, for the first time,
   that it is possible with a Gaussian basis to solve a six-dimensional
   vibrational Schrodinger equation. For the zero-point energy (ZPE) and
   the lowest 50 vibrational transitions of H2CO, we obtain a mean absolute
   error of less than 1 cm(-1); with 200 000 collocation points and 40 000
   basis functions, most errors are less than 0.4 cm(-1). }},

abstract = {{Calculating intensities of ro-vibrational transitions is particularly challenging for transitions from a given vibrational state to all upper states up to the dissociation limit because their probabilities decrease exponentially with increasing Î” n , the change in the vibrational quantum number. The experimental intensities available for low- Î” n values are well reproduced by a variety of models but the models can greatly diverge in predicting the intensities of unobserved high-overtone transitions, the divergence rapidly increasing with the overtone number. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the dipole-moment function (DMF) representation on the high-overtone intensity simulation of the \{CO\} molecule. We tested various \{DMF\} forms including pointwise representation combined with cubic-spline interpolation, power and trigonometric expansions, and PadÃ© approximants. Numerical calculations were performed with the highly accurate empirical potential-energy function (PEF) of Coxon and Hajigeorgiou (2004) using quadruple-precision arithmetic. Most calculated intensities fall off in the entire range of transitions according to the Normal Intensity Distribution Law (NIDL) (Medvedev, 2012). The slope of the \{NIDL\} trend line varies little between different analytical \{DMFs\} for a given \{PEF\} since the slope is basically associated with the PEF. Based on the NIDL, the limits within which the simulated intensities fall off up to the dissociation limit can be established. We claim that \{DMFs\} represented by analytical functions yield best results for all transitions. The pointwise functions (interpolated, in particular, by the conventional cubic splines) result in an unphysical flattening of the intensities at high- Î” n transitions, Î” n &gt; 7 for CO.}}

introduction of vibrational displacements obeying the Eckart conditions. It is
examined here, how such displacements may be constructed by orthogonal and nonorthogonal
transformations, and how they can be employed in developing the KEO. In particular,
it is shown analytically, by term by term comparison, that the Eckart KEOs obtained
by employing Pickettâ€™s method and the gateway Hamiltonian method are equivalent.
That is, although it may appear in the form of very different expressions, the
general, exact ro-vibrational Eckart frame KEO is unique. As side result, it has
been shown that the simple formula of the pseudo-potential derived by Watson for
the exact KEO given in normal coordinates applies to any Eckart frame KEO,

  abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the fundamental theory describing
	the interaction of electrons and photons. Its characteristic feature
	is that both radiation and matter are treated quantum mechanically.
	For almost all atomic and molecular systems, which contain bound
	electrons moving at velocities considerably less than that of light,
	a non-relativistic formulation of QED is appropriate. Termed molecular
	QED, its Hamiltonian operator can be constructed by starting from
	the classical Lagrangian function for the interaction of a charged
	particle with a radiation field on applying the variational calculus
	and carrying out the canonical quantization procedure. It is shown
	how the minimal-coupling Lagrangian can be transformed to the chemically
	advantageous multipolar Hamiltonian in which matter couples to radiation
	directly through molecular multipole moments, with the ensuing interaction
	strictly causal. Applications include evaluation of transition rates
	for one- and two-photon absorption, spontaneous and stimulated emission,
	and signal intensities for second- and third-harmonic generation.
	Fundamental intermolecular interactions examined include resonance
	energy transfer, the van der Waals dispersion potential, and the
	change in energy shift of the pair induced by intense external radiation.
	The non-relativistic contribution to the Lamb shift is also extracted.

  abstract = {A grid-based method designed to refine adiabatic potential energy
	surfaces (PES) of molecules via minimizing a suitable objective function
	is described. The objective function contains deviations from the
	reference (experimental) (ro)-vibrational energy levels and is based
	on PES correction values determined at the grid points within a discrete-variable-representation
	nuclear-motion algorithm and first-order perturbation theory (PT).
	The proposed PES refinement technique is tested on the ground electronic
	state of the MgH molecule. The large number of numerical test results
	obtained suggest the following: (1) first-order PT is able to yield
	accurate correction values at the grid points representing the PES,
	and for practical cases there seems to be no need to go to higher
	orders of PT; (2) with the number of grid points greatly exceeding
	the number of experimental energy levels included in the refinement
	procedure, terms additional to the ``obs-calc{''} term, including
	numerical first and second derivatives of the correction surface,
	are necessary in the objective function to arrive at a physically
	meaningful, ``smooth{''} correction surface; (3) for a given J rotational
	quantum number, the corrected PES is able to reproduce experimental
	(ro)vibrational energies to within tenths of cm(-1) if they are included
	in the refinement or interpolated between states that are involved
	in the optimization, whereas extrapolated states tend to have somewhat
	larger remaining discrepancies; (4) the PES refined only for the
	j = 0 states introduces a minor systematic error for J> 0 states,
	with discrepancies growing with j; (5) when the number of experimental
	energies included in the refinement greatly exceeds the number of
	grid points upon which the PES is optimized, the systematic error
	of treating states with different J rotational quantum numbers can
	be reduced and an impressive average accuracy can be achieved for
	all rovibrational states; and (6) in the case of quasibound (also
	known as resonance) rovibrational states, energies can be computed
	to accuracies similar to those of the bound states and excellent
	lifetimes (widths) can also be determined. Changes in thermochemical
	functions upon inclusion of quasibound states during direct summation
	is discussed.},

	photochemistry model is designed from the ground up to have the capacity

	oxidizing through reducing, which makes the code suitable for applications
	for the wide range of anticipated terrestrial exoplanet compositions.
	The one-dimensional chemical transport model treats up to 800 chemical
	reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wet deposition, surface
	emission, and thermal escape of O, H, C, N, and S bearing species,
	as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuric
	acid aerosols. We validate the model by computing the atmospheric
	composition of current Earth and Mars and find agreement with observations
	of major trace gases in Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. We simulate
	several plausible atmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets
	and choose three benchmark cases for atmospheres from reducing to
	oxidizing. The most interesting finding is that atomic hydrogen is
	always a more abundant reactive radical than the hydroxyl radical
	in anoxic atmospheres. Whether atomic hydrogen is the most important
	removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevant
	reaction rates. We also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e.,
	CH 4 and CO 2 ) are chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed
	in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition
	velocities to the surface control the atmospheric oxidation states.
	Furthermore, we revisit whether photochemically produced oxygen can
	cause false positives for detecting oxygenic photosynthesis, and
	find that in 1 bar CO 2 -rich atmospheres oxygen and ozone may build
	up to levels that have conventionally been accepted as signatures
	of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases. The atmospheric
	scenarios presented in this paper can serve as the benchmark atmospheres
	for quickly assessing the lifetime of trace gases in reducing, weakly
	oxidizing, and highly oxidizing atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets
	for the exploration of possible biosignature gases.}

  journal = PCCP,
  year = {2012},
  volume = {14},
  pages = {1085-1106},
  abstract = {Developments during the last two decades in nuclear motion theory
	made it possible to obtain variational solutions to the time-independent,
	nuclear-motion Schrodinger equation of polyatomic systems as ``exact''
	as the potential energy surface (PES) is. Nuclear motion theory thus
	reached a level whereby this branch of quantum chemistry started
	to catch up with the well developed and widely applied other branch,
	electronic structure theory. It seems to be fair to declare that
	we are now in the fourth age of quantum chemistry, where the first
	three ages are principally defined by developments in electronic
	structure techniques (G. Richards, Nature, 1979, 278, 507). In the
	fourth age we are able to incorporate into our quantum chemical treatment
	the motion of nuclei in an exact fashion and, for example, go beyond
	equilibrium molecular properties and compute accurate, temperature-dependent,
	effective properties, thus closing the gap between measurements and
	electronic structure computations. In this Perspective three fundamental
	algorithms for the variational solution of the time-independent nuclear-motion
	Schrodinger equation employing exact kinetic energy operators are
	presented: one based on tailor-made Hamiltonians, one on the Eckart-Watson
	Hamiltonian, and one on a general internal-coordinate Hamiltonian.
	It is argued that the most useful and most widely applicable procedure
	is the third one, based on a Hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy
	operator written in terms of internal coordinates and an arbitrary
	embedding of the body-fixed frame of the molecule. This Hamiltonian
	makes it feasible to treat the nuclear motions of arbitrary quantum
	systems, irrespective of whether they exhibit a single well-defined
	minimum or not, and of arbitrary reduced-dimensional models. As a
	result, molecular spectroscopy, an important field for the application
	of nuclear motion theory, has almost black-box-type tools at its
	disposal. Variational nuclear motion computations, based on an exact
	kinetic energy operator and an arbitrary PES, can now be performed
	for about 9 active vibrational degrees of freedom relatively straightforwardly.
	Simulations of high-resolution spectra allow the understanding of
	complete rotational-vibrational spectra up to and beyond the first
	dissociation limits. Variational results obtained for H2O, H-3(+),
	NH3, CH4, and H2CCO are used to demonstrate the power of the variational
	techniques for the description of vibrational and rotational excitations.
	Some qualitative features of the results are also discussed.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic networks (SNs) are large, finite, weighted, undirected, rooted graphs, where the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. While first-principles SNs are "deterministic" by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness ("stochasticity") is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotationalâ€“vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. }

	of the underlying Hamiltonian matrix elements are inaccurate, deviating
	substantially from their values in a variational basis representation.
	Examples are presented for the discrete variable representation and
	the Lagrange-mesh approaches, demonstrating that highly accurate
	eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be obtained even if some or even
	all of the Hamiltonian matrix elements in these grid-based representations
	are inaccurate. It is shown how the apparent contradiction of obtaining
	accurate eigenpairs with far less accurate individual matrix elements
	can be resolved by considering the unitary transformation between
	the representations. Furthermore, the relations connecting orthonormal

	connecting nonorthogonal, regularized bases and the corresponding
	nonorthogonal, regularized Lagrange bases.},

abstract = {Approaches related to graph theory are investigated which allow a better understanding and yield routes for systematic enlargement and improvement of experimental spectroscopic line lists of molecules. The proposed protocols are based on the fact that quantum mechanics builds, in a simple and natural way, large-scale, weighted, undirected graphs, whereby the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. A small part of molecular quantum mechanical graphs can be probed experimentally via high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, while the complete graph encompassing the full line list information for a given molecule can be obtained through sophisticated variational nuclear motion computations. Both approaches yield what one may call spectroscopic networks (SNs). It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule that both the measured and the computed one-photon absorption SNs have a scale-free behavior with all of the usual consequences, including appearance of hubs, robustness, error tolerance, and the small-world property. For the complete computed "deterministic" network the scale-free property holds if a realistic intensity cut-off is employed during its build-up, thus introducing "stochasticity". The graph-theoretical view of molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of the information systems containing high-resolution spectroscopic data. }

	diatomic molecule containing only crystal-field and spin-orbit operators
	is set up to describe the energies of the five spin-orbit components
	that arise in the ground electronic configuration of the nickel monohalides.
	The model assumes that bonding in the nickel halides has the approximate
	form Ni+X-, with an electronic 3d(9) configuration plus closed shells
	on the Ni+ moiety and a closed shell configuration on the X- moiety.
	From a crystal-field point of view, interactions of the positive
	d-hole with the cylindrically symmetrical electric charge distribution
	of the hypothetical NiX- closed-shell core can then be parameterized
	by three terms in a traditional expansion in values comparable with
	those for the vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 3/2 and vertical
	bar Omega vertical bar = 5/2 states by fixing A to its value in Ni+
	and then introducing an empirical correction factor for one off-diagonal
	orbital matrix element. In the second part of this paper the usual
	effective Hamiltonian B(J-L-S)(2) for a rotating diatomic molecule
	is used to derive expressions for the Q-type doubling parameter p
	in the two vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 1/2 states. These expressions
	show (for certain sign conventions) that the sum of the two p values
	should be similar to 2B, but that their difference can vary between
	-10B and +10B. These theoretical results are in good agreement with
	the two observed p values for both NiF and NiCl. The present formalism
	should in principle be applicable to NiBr and Nil, and to the halides
	of palladium, since Pd+ has a well isolated 4d(9) electronic ground
	configuration. Extension to metal halides having d(n) configurations
	with n < 9, or to platinum halides may present difficulties, since
	manifolds from the d(n) and d(n-1)s configurations may be heavily
	mixed, thus requiring ``too many{''} parameters in the electronic
	part of the problem. Application to linear triatomic molecules may
	also present problems because of the large number of vibronic perturbations
	made possible by their four vibrational degrees of freedom.}},

The present work specifically considers 1/sin2Î¸ singularities and wavefunctions showing significant amplitude close to Î¸=0. It investigates the use of direct product-type discrete variable representations (DVRs) to describe such situations in quantum dynamics calculations and discusses the regularization of such repulsive singularities. A new scheme, the cot-DVR, is developed which can be used to construct well converging direct product DVRs for Hamiltonians showing a 1/sin2Î¸ singularity. The cot-DVR is based on the diagonalization of the cotÎ¸-matrix and adds two additional basis function, sin(Î¸) and sin(2Î¸), to the standard basis of Legendre polynomials. It is particularly well suited for multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree calculations which employ one-dimensional (bottom layer) single-particle functions."

version 7 are presented in this report. In particular, the Cholesky decomposition
method applied to some quantum chemical methods is described. This approach is
used both in the context of a straight forward approximation of the twoâ€electron
integrals and in the generation of soâ€called auxiliary basis sets. The article
describes how the method is implemented for most known wave functions models:
selfâ€consistent field, density functional theory, 2nd order perturbation theory,
completeâ€active space selfâ€consistent field multiconfigurational reference 2nd
order perturbation theory, and coupledâ€cluster methods. The report further
elaborates on the implementation of a restrictedâ€active space selfâ€consistent
field reference function in conjunction with 2nd order perturbation theory.
The average atomic natural orbital basis for relativistic calculations, covering
the whole periodic table, are described and associated unique properties are
demonstrated. Furthermore, the use of the arbitrary order Douglasâ€Krollâ€Hess
transformation for oneâ€component relativistic calculations and its implementation
are discussed. This section especially focuses on the implementation of the soâ€called
pictureâ€changeâ€free atomic orbital property integrals. Moreover, the ElectroStatic
Potential Fitted scheme, a version of a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics hybrid
method implemented in MOLCAS, is described and discussed. Finally, the report
discusses the use of the MOLCAS package for advanced studies of photo chemical
phenomena and the usefulness of the algorithms for constrained geometry optimization
in MOLCAS in association with such studies. Â© 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 2010},

   rotation) and DVR functions (for vibration). A key advantage of the DVR
   is the fact that one can prune the basis: many DVR functions can be
   discarded from the original direct product basis. This significantly
   reduces the cost of the calculation. We have implemented a mapping
   procedure to exploit this prune-ability. We explain how to treat
   Coriolis terms in a parity-adapted basis. The method is tested by

   splitting of malonaldehyde using an accurate ab initio potential energy
   surface}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {128},
pages = {224314},
Abstract = {Quantum calculations of the ground vibrational state tunneling splitting
   of H-atom and D-atom transfer in malonaldehyde are performed on a
   full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface (PES). The PES is a
   fit to 11 147 near basis-set-limit frozen-core CCSD(T) electronic
   energies. This surface properly describes the invariance of the
   potential with respect to all permutations of identical atoms. The
   saddle-point barrier for the H-atom transfer on the PES is 4.1 kcal/mol,
   in excellent agreement with the reported ab initio value. Model
   one-dimensional and ``exact{''} full-dimensional calculations of the
   splitting for H- and D-atom transfer are done using this PES. The
   tunneling splittings in full dimensionality are calculated using the
   unbiased ``fixed-node{''} diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method in
   Cartesian and saddle-point normal coordinates. The ground-state
   tunneling splitting is found to be 21.6 cm(-1) in Cartesian coordinates
   and 22.6 cm(-1) in normal coordinates, with an uncertainty of 2-3
   cm(-1). This splitting is also calculated based on a model which makes
   use of the exact single-well zero-point energy (ZPE) obtained with the
   MULTIMODE code and DMC ZPE and this calculation gives a tunneling
   splitting of 21-22 cm(-1). The corresponding computed splittings for the
   D-atom transfer are 3.0, 3.1, and 2-3 cm(-1). These calculated tunneling
   splittings agree with each other to within less than the standard
   uncertainties obtained with the DMC method used, which are between 2 and
   3 cm(-1), and agree well with the experimental values of 21.6 and 2.9
   cm(-1) for the H and D transfer, respectively.},

Journal = MP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {2145-2182},
Abstract = {In this article, we review state-of-the-art methods for computing
   vibrational energies of polyatomic molecules using quantum mechanical,
   variationally-based approaches. We illustrate the power of those methods
   by presenting applications to molecules with more than four atoms. This
   demonstrates the great progress that has been made in this field in the
   last decade in dealing with the exponential scaling with the number of
   vibrational degrees of freedom. In this review we present three methods
   that effectively obviate this bottleneck. The first important idea is
   the n-mode representation of the Hamiltonian and notably the potential.
   The potential (and other functions) is represented as a sum of terms
   that depend on a subset of the coordinates. This makes it possible to
   compute matrix elements, form a Hamiltonian matrix, and compute its
   eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Another approach takes advantage of this
   multimode representation and represents the terms as a sum of products.
   It then exploits the powerful multiconfiguration Hartree time-dependent
   method to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and extract the
   eigenvalue spectrum. The third approach we present uses contracted basis
   functions in conjunction with a Lanczos eigensolver. Matrix vector
   products are done without transforming to a direct-product grid. The
   usefulness of these methods is demonstrated for several example
   molecules, e.g. methane, methanol and the Zundel cation.},

Year = {{2004}},

Pages = {2411-2423},
Abstract = {{A simple variational procedure, termed DOPI for discrete variable
   representation-Hamiltonian in orthogonal coordinates-direct product
   basis-iterative diagonalization, is described and applied to compute
   low-lying vibrational band origins (VBOs) of the triatomic systems H2O,
   CO2, and N2O, employing published empirical and theoretical sextic force
   fields. While in these cases no difficulties arise when quartic
   potentials are used, the limited range of applicability of 6th-order
   potentials presents difficulties for the variational determination of
   VBOs, in particular for the higher-lying bending states. For H2O,
   transformation of quadratic and quartic force fields from simple bond
   stretching to Simons-Parr-Finian (SPF) coordinates results in computed
   VBOs deviating less from experiment. This, however, does not hold for
   the VBOs computed from the transformed sextic force fields where the two
   representations provide highly similar results. While use of empirical
   quartic and sextic force fields result in a much better reproduction of
   experimental VBOs than that of ab initio force fields, especially at
   higher (fifth- and sixth-) order the empirical force constants, obtained
   through different refinement procedures, do not correspond to the
   associated derivatives of the potential energy surface (PES). Rotational
   constants characterizing low-lying vibrational states have been
   evaluated as expectation values using inertia tensor formulas in the
   Eckart and principal axis frames. Only the Eckart axes should be used
   for these computations and they yield accurate vibrationally averaged
   rotational constants.}},

Standard fitting routines can be made robust to such outliers by the method of iteratively reweighted least squares. It is proposed here that the weight of datum i in a give iteration is given by w(i) = 1/(sigma(i)(2) + alphar(i)(2)), where sigma(i) is the standard deviation for the idealized distribution without outliers, and r(i) is the residual from the previous iteration. The value of alpha should depend on the fractional number of outliers and the size of their residuals, but a standard value of alpha = 1/3 is suggested for spectroscopic applications.

	allows the approach to be extended to anharmonic functions. This
	approach has the additional advantage of allowing the elimination
	of the spurious states, a common problem in a local coordinate representation.
	An important advantage of this symmetrization method is that it allows
	generation of a code to analyse any molecular system with a minimum

    abstract = {The empirical determination of Born–Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) correction functions from the analysis of high resolution diatomic molecule spectra is becoming increasingly common. However, in virtually all applications to date, the analytic expressions used to represent those functions have unphysical limiting behaviour which makes the resulting overall potential energy functions unusable at long-range. This paper delineates the limiting physical constraints, which should be imposed on the form of such BOB correction functions, and presents flexible new expressions incorporating those constraints. The utility of these new forms is illustrated by a re-analysis of recent high resolution IR data for the ground electronic state of AgH, which yields an updated potential energy function and more meaningful adiabatic (potential) and non-adiabatic (centrifugal) BOB correction functions for this system. Further examination of this AgH system also illustrates the problem of model dependence associated with efforts to determine physically unique potential energy and centrifugal BOB correction functions.}

  pages = {8560-8570},
  abstract = {The conformation and dynamical behavior of molecular systems is very
	often advantageously described in terms of physically well-adapted
	curvilinear coordinates. It is rather easy to show that the numerous
	analytical expressions of the kinetic energy operator of a molecular
	system described in terms of n curvilinear coordinates can all be
	transformed into the following more usable expression: (T) over cap=Sigma(ij)f(2)(ij)(q)partial
	derivative(2)/partial derivativeq(i)partial derivativeq(j)+Sigma(i)f(1)(i)(q)partial
	derivative/partial derivativeq(i)+nu(q), where f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q),
	and nu(q) are functions of the curvilinear coordinates q=(...,q(i),...).
	If the advantages of curvilinear coordinates are unquestionable,
	they do have a major drawback: the sometimes awful complexity of
	the analytical expression of the kinetic operator (T) over cap for
	molecular systems with more than five atoms. Therefore, we develop
	an algorithm for computing (T) over cap for a given value of the
	n curvilinear coordinates q. The calculation of the functions f(2)(ij)(q),
	f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) only requires the knowledge of the Cartesian
	coordinates and their derivatives in terms of the n curvilinear coordinates.
	This coordinate transformation (curvilinear-->Cartesian) is very
	easy to perform and is widely used in quantum chemistry codes resorting
	to a Z-matrix to define the curvilinear coordinates. Thus, the functions
	f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) can be evaluated numerically and
	exactly for a given value of q, which makes it possible to propagate
	wavepackets or to simulate the spectra of rather complex systems
	(constrained Hamiltonian). The accuracy of this numerical procedure
	is tested by comparing two calculations of the bending spectrum of
	HCN: the first one, performed by using the present numerical kinetic
	operator procedure, the second one, obtained in previous studies,
	by using an analytical kinetic operator. Finally, the ab initio computation
	of the internal rotation spectrum and wave functions of 2-methylpropanal
	by means of dimensionality reduction, is given as an original application.},

	For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of

	It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ

	then they do for first- and second-row elements. Based on the results
	of these studies criteria are deduced for the accuracy of auxiliary

	for electron repulsion integrals. Optimized auxiliary basis sets
	for RI-MP2 calculations fulfilling these criteria are reported for
	the sets cc-pVXZ, cc-pV(X+d)Z, aug-cc-pVXZ, and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z with

abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
	(MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24
	(!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	(CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed.},

Abstract = {{We present a simple Lanczos method for calculating rovibrational energy
   levels of a triatomic molecule from a kinetic energy operator (KEO) with
   the z axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. We use rotational basis
   functions which are linear combinations of symmetric top functions so
   that all matrix elements are real. For some molecules, coupling between
   rotation and vibration is less important if the z axis is chosen
   perpendicular to the molecular plane, but the singularities of the
   z-axis operator are more difficult to deal with than those of the
   commonly used y-axis operator. The KEO with z axis perpendicular to the
   plane also reduces the number of sums over vibrational indices required
   to evaluate Hamiltonian matrix-vector products. Using a new
   symmetry-adapted basis and the z-axis KEO we calculate rovibrational
   energy levels of H2O for high J values. Even at J=40 we do not observe
   the formation of fourfold clusters. }},

The potential energy can include any differentiable function of the torsion angle and there is no need for a special treatment for cases where planar conformations are not extrema. The resulting code is simpler than the original version and yields correct derivatives in all practical situations. Because the minimum of the torsion energy can be at any angle, the functionality of the existing energy routines is generalized. Â© 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Abstract = {The correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets (cc-pVXZ) for
   the atoms boron through neon have been extended to treat core and
   core-valence correlation effects. Basis functions were added to the
   existing cc-pVXZ sets to form correlation-consistent polarized
   core-valence sets (cc-pCVXZ) in the usual pattern: Double zeta added
   (1s1p), triple zeta added (2s2p1d), quadruple zeta added (3s3p2d1f), and
   quintuple zeta added (4s4p3d2f1g). The exponents of the core functions
   were determined by minimizing the difference between all-electron and
   valence-only correlation energies obtained from HF+1+2 calculations on
   the ground states of the atoms. With the cc-pCVXZ sets, core,
   core-valence, and valence correlation energies all converge
   exponentially toward apparent complete basis set (CBS) limits, as do the
   corresponding all-electron singles and doubles CI energies. Several test
   applications of the new sets are presented: The first two ionization
   potentials of boron, the P-3-S-5 separation in carbon, and the (X) over
   tilde(3)B(1)-(a) over tilde(1)A(1) state separation in CH2. As expected,
   correlation effects involving the core electrons of the first row atoms,
   B-Ne, are small but must be included if high accuracy is required. (C)

In modern methods of solution, the coupled equations are solved by propagating the log-derivative of the wavefunction. Eigenvalues are located by searching for zeroes of: the determinant of the ''log-derivative matching matrix'' The resulting methods are very stable, and are the method of choice for providing eigenvalues to very high precision.

Title = {{Vibration-rotation hamiltonians of linear-molecules}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {943-951},
Abstract = {The construction of the molecular vibration-rotation Hamiltonian is
considered, with particular reference to two alternative treatments of
molecules with linear reference configurations. These can be considered
to have either (i) 3N - 5 vibrational and 2 rotational degrees of
freedom or (ii) 3N - 6 vibrational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom.
In either case the classical kinetic energy consists of vibrational,
rotational and translational parts given by 2T = SIGMA(k) P(k)2 +
SIGMA(alphabeta) omega(alpha)I(alphabeta)'omega(beta) + 1/M P2.
The rotational part contains the angular velocity omega and the
modified moment of inertia tensor I' of Wilson and Howard, which also
occurs in the relation J(alpha) - pi(alpha) =
SIGMA(beta)I(alphabeta)omega(beta)' involving the total (J) and
vibrational (pi) angular momenta. In case (i), I' has a vanishing z row
and column, where z is the axis of the molecule. This is associated with
the Sayvetz condition that the total angular momentum about the axis is
purely vibrational. These equations therefore contain only the two
components omega(x) and omega(y) of omega, which can be eliminated to
give the Hamiltonian form of the kinetic energy. In case (ii), the z
row and column of the I' matrix are non-vanishing and I' is
non-singular. The three components of omega can therefore be obtained in
terms of the angular momenta, to give a treatment that is entirely
analogous to that for a nonlinear reference configuration. The
parameters of the case (ii) Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of those
of case (i).},

abstract = {We have developed a method for structure refinement based on molecular dynamics in four spatial dimensions (4D-MD). The method was applied with success to the structure refinement of Cyclosporin A (CPA) and the lac -repressor headpiece (LAC) using atom-atom distance restraints derived from NMR data, two cases where conventional MD refinement methods failed. In the case of CPA we were able to refine seven out of nine substantially different structures, while conventional MD only refines three structures. Previously, it had appeared to be impossible to refine a given LAC structure with conventional MD methods, manual modifications were necessary in order to fulfil all the distance restraints. In this study we show that LAC can be refined without manual interference and using only 5000 steps (10 ps) of 4D-MD. The latter result is particularly interesting because it indicates that this method may be a very useful tool when modelling loops in proteins.}

	{[}Zhang, Chu, and Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 88, 6233 (1988)] for quantum
	reactive scattering. (It can also be readily used for quantum eigenvalue
	problems). The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely
	simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal,
	as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ``universal,{''} i.e., independent
	of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions;
	it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different
	basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid
	points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential
	energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H + H2 -->
	H2 + H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities
	is achieved with only about 15\% more DVR grid points than the number
	of conventional basis functions used in previous S-matrix Kohn calculations.
	Test calculations for the collinear Cl + HCl --> ClH + Cl reaction
	shows that the unusual dynamical features of heavy + light-heavy
	reactions are also well described by this approach. Since DVR approaches
	avoid having to evaluate integrals in order to obtain the Hamiltonian
	matrix and since a DVR Hamiltonian matrix is extremely sparse, this
	DVR version of the S-matrix Kohn approach should make it possible
	to deal with more complex chemical reactions than heretofore possible.},

	atmospheres is discussed in terms of the physical and mathematical
	conditions under which this method is valid. Two correlated conditions
	are necessary and sufficient for the exact transformation of the
	wavenumber integration to an integration over the cumulative probability
	(g), a monotonically increasing and smooth function in the absorption
	coefficient space. These conditions involve the use of a reference
	condition to define the absorption coefficient and an assumption
	concerning the ordering of the absorption coefficient. The correlated
	conditions are exact in the context of a single line, periodic lines,
	and the strong- and weak-line limits. In realistic atmospheres, these
	assumptions am best for adjacent levels but produce increasing blurring
	or deviations for distant levels. We investigate the blurring of
	the correlated assumptions on the computations of fluxes and heating
	rates based on ``exact{''} line-by-line results, using a variety
	of atmospheric profiles and spectral intervals containing principal
	absorbing gases. In the thermal infrared, errors in fluxes am less
	than 0.2\% for H2O, CO2, CH4, and N2O, and approximately 2\% for
	O3. Errors in heating rates are less than 0.01 K day-1 for these
	gases below approximately 30 km. Larger errors of approximately 0.1
	K day-1 can occur at some levels above this height. For H2O lines
	in the solar region, errors in fluxes and heating rates are within
	0.05\% and 0.01 K day-1, respectively. Based on numerical experimentation,
	we find that the number of g values ranging from 1 (for weak bands)
	to approximately 10 (for strong bands) are usually sufficient to
	achieve acceptable accuracy for flux and heating rate calculations.
	The correlated k-distribution method differs fundamentally from the
	traditional approach that employs scaling approximations and band
	models to separate height and wavenumber integrations for transmittance
	calculations. The equivalent k values for various gases computed
	from this approach can be directly incorporated in the multiple-scattering
	program involving cloud and aerosol particles.}},

to work in a nuclear coordinate system tailored to the nuclear potential
energy surface. It is now possible to derive the kinetic energy
operator for virtually any coordinate system by using computer algebra
programs. We discuss how to choose coordinates for use in practical
calculations, in particular variational energy level calculations, with
special consideration of the vibration-rotation separation. As an
example we present a kinetic energy operator suitable for calculating
the rovibrational spectrum of sequentially bonded four-atomic molecules,
using valence coordinates. We carry out a rigorous symmetry
classification usign the MS group, and also consider how the problem of
singularities affects the choice of basis set.},

electrons included in the correlation procedure) could be used to determine
whether a single-reference-based electron correlation procedure is appropriate.
This diagnostic T1 is defined for use with self-consistent-field molecular
orbitals and is invariant to the same orbital rotations as the coupled-cluster
energy. T1 is investigated for several different chemical systems which exhibit
a range of multireference behavior and is shown to be an excellent measure of
the importance of nondynamical electron correlation and is far superior to C0
from a singles and doubles configuration interaction wave function. It is further
suggested that when the aim is to recover a large fraction of the dynamical
electron correlation energy, a large T1 (i.e., >0.02) probably indicates the
need for a multireference electron correlation procedure.},

algebraically, presenting the full set of equations for a general reference function
explicitly in spinâ€“orbital form. The computational implementation of the CCSD model,
which involves cubic and quartic terms, is discussed and results are reported and
compared with full CI calculations for H2O and BeH2. We demonstrate that the CCSD
exponential ansatz sums higherâ€order correlation effects efficiently even for BeH2,
near its transition state geometry where quasidegeneracy efforts are quite large,
recovering 98% of the full CI correlation energy. For H2O, CCSD plus the fourthâ€order
triple excitation correction agrees with the full CI energy to 0.5 kcal/mol.
Comparisons with lowâ€order models provide estimates of the effect of the higherâ€order
terms T1T2, T21T2, T31, and T41 on the correlation energy.},

Using these results, an analytical potential energy surface is determined, from which the barrier to linearity is calculated to be 931 cmâˆ’1 (Î±e = 137Â°). It is demonstrated how reliable J = 0 and J = 1 vibrational levels can be calculated variationally for such a quasi-linear molecule with a small barrier height. Similar calculations are carried out on a model CH2 potential (barrier height 2200 cmâˆ’1) in order to confirm the method for intermediate barrier cases. The calculation of a bending vibrational wavenumber of 964 cmâˆ’1 (experimental 957 Â± 10 cmâˆ’1), suggests that the procedure has correctly converged, and also that the potential is reasonably accurate."

	theorem. The energy derivative definition of the first-order properties
	corrects the Hellmann---Feynman results for an incomplete variational
	treatment of the perturbation effects. The additional term which
	is referred to as the Brillouin correction is computed for the dipole
	moments of FH, H2O, \{NH3\} and \{CO\} using the \{CI\} functions
	involving single and double substitutions with respect to the \{HF\}
	determinant. It is shown that the Brillouin correction gives a substantial
	contribution to the dipole moment of the \{CO\} molecule. This indicates
	that it may be fortuitous that some data previously calculated from
	\{CI\} functions by using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem are close
	to the experimental value. The structure of the Brillouin correction
	is analysed in terms of the diagrammatic expansion of the correlation
	corrections to the first-order properties. Additionally, some rough
	estimates of the influence of the unlinked diagrams are obtained
	by computing the so-called corrections due to Davidson and Siegbahn.

    abstract = {Some of the pure rotational transitions of polyatomic molecules
    that are forbidden according to the rigid rotor selection rules may acquire
    intensity by a centrifugal distortion mechanism, in which the intensity
    depends on the dipole derivatives and on the displacements in the normal
    coordinates produced by centrifugal distortion. The structures of the predicted
    spectra are discussed for nonpolar molecules belonging to the point
    groups D3 h, Dn ( n > 2), D2 d, and Td. Some of the calculated R-branch
    lines of methane are stronger than some of the lines of HD already observed
    in the same frequency range. For polar molecules extra contributions to the
    intensity must be considered and are exemplified for the Î” k = Â±3 transitions
    of C3 v molecules. These forbidden rotational transitions may have some
    astrophysical importance.},

abstract = { The correct quantum-mechanical form for the vibration-rotation bamiltonian of a linear molecule is derived by an extension of the method of Wilson and Howard. The absence of the third rotational degree of freedom complicates the relations obeyed by the angular momentum components in this hamiltonian. Calculations of energy levels can be simplified by transforming to the â€˜isomorphicâ€™ hamiltonian introduced by Hougen. The application of this isomorphic transformation to other operators is illustrated with the dipole moment operator. }
