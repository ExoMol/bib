  abstract = {Exoplanets, and in particular hot ones such as hot Jupiters, require
	very significant quantities of molecular spectroscopic data to model
	radiative transport in their atmospheres or to interpret their spectra.
	This data is commonly provided in the form of very extensive transition
	line lists. The size of these line lists is such that constructing
	a single model may require the consideration of several billion lines.
	We present a procedure to simplify this process based on the use
	of cross sections. Line lists for water, HI, HCN/HNC and ammonia
	have been turned into cross sections on a fine enough grid to preserve
	their spectroscopic features. Cross sections are provided at a fixed
	range of temperatures and an interpolation procedure which can be
	used to generate cross sections at arbitrary temperatures is described.
	A web-based interface (www.exomol.com/xsecs) has been developed to
	allow astronomers to download cross sections at specified temperatures
	and spectral resolution. Specific examples are presented for water
	and ammonia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Extensive line lists generated as part of the ExoMol project are used to compute lifetimes for individual rotational, rovibrational and rovibronic excited states, and temperature-dependent cooling functions by summing over all dipole-allowed transitions for the states concerned. Results are presented for SiO, CaH, AlO, ScH, H 2 O and methane. The results for CH 4 are particularly unusual with four excited states with no dipole-allowed decay route and several others, where these decays lead to exceptionally long lifetimes. These lifetime data should be useful in models of masers and estimates of critical densities, and can provide a link with laboratory measurements. Cooling functions are important in stellar and planet formation.}
