abstract = {SENTINEL 4 is an imaging UVN (UV-VIS-NIR) spectrometer, developed by Airbus Defence and Space under ESA contract in the frame of the joint European Union (EU)/ESA COPERNICUS program. The mission objective is the operational monitoring of trace gas concentrations for atmospheric chemistry and climate applications. To this end SENTINEL 4 will provide accurate measurements of key atmospheric constituents such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, as well as aerosol and cloud properties.},

Title = {{Tropospheric emissions: Monitoring of pollution (TEMPO)}},
Journal =JQSRT,

Pages = {17-39},
Abstract = {{TEMPO was selected in 2012 by NASA as the first Earth Venture
   Instrument, for launch between 2018 and 2021. It will measure
   atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using
   ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO observes from Mexico City,
   Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic
   to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (similar to 2.1 km
   N/S x 4.4 km E/W at 36.5 degrees N, 100 degrees W). TEMPO provides a
   tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of
   tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon
   cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO)
   orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of
   emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth
   orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product
   spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale.
   Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission
   inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective
   emission-control strategies.
   TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a
   modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone
   (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde
   (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide),
   water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and
   foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or
   by proxy, in the tropospheric O-3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral
   observations provide sensitivity to O-3 in the lowermost troposphere,
   substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO
   quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides
   these near-realtime air quality products that will be made publicly
   available. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be the North American
   component of the global geostationary constellation of pollution
   monitoring together with the European Sentinel-4 (S4) and Korean
   Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments.}},
