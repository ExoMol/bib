Title = {{Exoplanet spectroscopy and photometry with the Twinkle space telescope}},
Journal = {Exp. Astron.},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {29-63},
Abstract = {{The Twinkle space telescope has been designed for the characterisation
   of exoplanets and Solar System objects. Operating in a low Earth,
   Sun-synchronous orbit, Twinkle is equipped with a 45 cm telescope and
   visible (0.4 - 1 m) and infrared (1.3 - 4.5 m) spectrometers which can
   be operated simultaneously. Twinkle is a general observatory which will
   provide on-demand observations of a wide variety of targets within
   wavelength ranges that are currently not accessible using other space
   telescopes or accessible only to oversubscribed observatories in the
   short-term future. Here we explore the ability of Twinkle's
   spectrometers to characterise the currently-known exoplanets. We study
   the spectral resolution achievable by combining multiple observations
   for various planetary and stellar types. We also simulate spectral
   retrievals for some well-known planets (HD 209458 b, GJ 3470 b and 55
   Cnc e). From the exoplanets known today, we find that with a single
   transit or eclipse, Twinkle could probe 89 planets at low spectral
   resolution (R < 20) as well as 12 planets at higher resolution (R > 20)
   in channel 1 (1.3 - 4.5 m). With 10 observations, the atmospheres of 144
   planets could be characterised with R <20 and 81 at higher resolutions.
   Upcoming surveys will reveal thousands of new exoplanets, many of which
   will be located within Twinkle's field of regard. TESS in particular is
   predicted to discover many targets around bright stars which will be
   suitable for follow-up observations. We include these anticipated
   planets and find that the number of planets Twinkle could observe in the
   near infrared in a single transit or eclipse increases R > 20. By
   stacking 10 transits, there are 1185 potential targets for study at R <
   20 as well as 388 planets at higher resolutions. The majority of targets
   are found to be large gaseous planets although by stacking multiple
   observations smaller planets around bright stars (e.g. 55 Cnc e) could
   be observed with Twinkle. Photometry and low resolution spectroscopy
   with Twinkle will be useful to refine planetary, stellar and orbital
   parameters, monitor stellar activity through time and search for transit
   time and duration variations (TTVs and TDVs). Refinement of these
   parameters could be used to in the planning of observations with larger
   space-based observatories such as JWST and ARIEL. For planets orbiting
   very bright stars, Twinkle observations at higher spectral resolution
   will enable us to probe the chemical and thermal properties of an
   atmosphere. Simultaneous coverage across a wide wavelength range will
   reduce the degeneracies seen with Hubble and provide access to
   detections of a wide range molecules. There is the potential to revisit
   them many times over the mission lifetime to detect variations in cloud
   cover.}},

Title = {{Tropospheric emissions: Monitoring of pollution (TEMPO)}},
Journal =JQSRT,

Pages = {17-39},
Abstract = {{TEMPO was selected in 2012 by NASA as the first Earth Venture
   Instrument, for launch between 2018 and 2021. It will measure
   atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using
   ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO observes from Mexico City,
   Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic
   to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (similar to 2.1 km
   N/S x 4.4 km E/W at 36.5 degrees N, 100 degrees W). TEMPO provides a
   tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of
   tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon
   cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO)
   orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of
   emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth
   orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product
   spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale.
   Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission
   inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective
   emission-control strategies.
   TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a
   modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone
   (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde
   (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide),
   water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and
   foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or
   by proxy, in the tropospheric O-3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral
   observations provide sensitivity to O-3 in the lowermost troposphere,
   substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO
   quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides
   these near-realtime air quality products that will be made publicly
   available. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be the North American
   component of the global geostationary constellation of pollution
   monitoring together with the European Sentinel-4 (S4) and Korean
   Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments.}},
