observed and interpreted as a critical phenomenon. Very strong distortion of
line strengths was also found for rotational transitions in the region of critical
phenomena. The measured frequencies were fitted, together with available MW data
and IR ground state combination differences, in the modified Watson Hamiltonian
and the sets of rotational and centrifugal distortion constants were obtained. Â© 1992.},

abstract = {Nonlinear effects in rotational spectra of molecules and atomic nuclei
caused by a centrifugal distortion for high values of an angular momentum quantum
number J are investigated. The theoretical analysis is based on a new expansion
form of the effective rotational Hamiltonian. It is shown that qualitative changes
of rotational motion may occur in the rotational spectra for some value Jc of the
quantum number J. These phenomena which are in some sense analogous to the macroscopic
phase transitions are called critical phenomena and correspond to bifurcations in
classical mechanics. The classification of critical phenomena for a purely rotational
motion is given. This classification is based on the concept of a local symmetry group.
There exist five types of critical phenomena in the rotational spectra. The local
critical phenomena occuring in a bounded region of the rotational motion phase
space are specially discussed. In the classical limit the local critical phenomena
are characterized by a broken symmetry and discontinuity of the second derivative
of the rotational energy with respect to J at Jc. A universal rotational Hamiltonian
is shown to exist in the neighborhood of Jc, which does not depend on the dynamical
systems internal structure up to numerical values of its parameters. A phenomenological
theory of the local critical phenomena is developed with the aid of universal Hamiltonians.
The difference between the local critical phenomena and second-order phase transitions
in macroscopic systems is shown.},
