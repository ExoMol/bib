    abstract = {The hydrogen and water molecules respond very differently to the collisional-radiative processes taking place in planetary atmospheres. Naturally, the question arises whether H2O-rich atmospheres are more (or less) resilient to long-term mass loss than H2-dominated ones if they radiate away the incident stellar energy more (or less) efficiently. If confirmed, the finding would have implications on our understanding of the evolution of sub-Neptune exoplanets. As a key step towards answering this question, we present a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of H2O for the atmospheric region where the gas accelerates to escape the planet and conditions relevant to close-in sub-Neptunes. Our exploratory calculations for isothermal gas composed of H2, H2O and e- reveal that: (1) In the pressure region ~10-2–10-4 dyn cm-2 where the stellar extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) photons are typically deposited in the atmosphere, H2O is in rotational LTE but vibrational NLTE. Vibrational LTE is facilitated by high H2O abundances and fractional ionizations, and we report critical densities for the LTE-NLTE transition; (2) Vibrational cooling may locally dominate over rotational cooling, partly because of the comparatively small opacities of ro-vibrational lines; (3) Even low H2O abundances notably enhance the cooling, foreseeably offsetting some of the stellar heating; (4) Heating due to the deposition of stellar infrared (IR) photons is significant at pressures ?0.1 dyn cm-2. We estimate the contribution of H2O excitation to the internal energy of the gas and speculate on the photodissociation from the excited vibrational states. Ultimately, our findings motivate the consideration of NLTE in the mass loss rate calculations of H2O-rich atmospheres.}

The methodology is based on accurate{,} extensive ro-vibrational line lists containing transitions with high vibrational excitations and relies on the detailed ro-vibrational assignments. The developed methodology is applied to model non-LTE IR and visible spectra of silylene (SiH2) produced in a decomposition of disilane (Si2H6){,} a reaction of technological importance. Two approaches for non-LTE vibrational populations of the product SiH2 are introduced: a simplistic 1D approach based on the Harmonic approximation and a full 3D model incorporating accurate vibrational wavefunctions of SiH2 computed variationally with the TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energy) program. We show how their non-LTE spectral signatures can be used to trace different reaction channels of molecular dissociations.}

We consider non-Boltzmann distributions that account for the ineffectiveness of collisions. We analyze the sodium doublet in transmission spectra measured at low (HAT-P-1b, HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b, WASP-6b, WASP-17b, and WASP-39b) and high (WASP-49b) spectral resolutions. Nested-sampling retrievals performed on low-resolution optical/visible transmission spectra are unable to break the normalization degeneracy if the spectral continuum is associated with Rayleigh scattering by small cloud particles. Using mock retrievals, we demonstrate that unnormalized ground-based, high-resolution spectra centered on the sodium doublet alone are unable to precisely inform us about the pressure levels probed by the transit chord and hence to identify the region (i.e., thermosphere, exosphere) of the atmosphere being probed. Retrievals performed on the HARPS transmission spectrum of WASP-49b support this conclusion. Generally, we are unable to distinguish between LTE versus NLTE interpretations of the sodium doublet based on the computed Bayesian evidence with the implication that LTE interpretations tend to underestimate the temperature probed by the transit chord. With the current low-resolution data, the sodium line shapes are consistent with Voigt profiles without the need for sub-Lorentzian wings. The retrieved sodium abundances are consistent with being subsolar to solar.}

(NIMS) on board the Galileo spacecraft during its Venus fly-by. Those data, containing a strong non-LTE component, showed a structure in the 4.3-?m spectral region which was challenging for non-LTE models so far. The model used in this work was refined after analysis of Martian CO2 atmospheric emission taken by the ?Planetary Fourier Spectrometer? (PFS) and the ?Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer? (OMEGA) instruments on board Mars Express. Here we show that both the limb and the nadir measurements of the Venus daylight atmosphere taken at 4.3-?m by NIMS can be fitted reasonably well with the revised model. This gives confidence in the usage of such model for the analysis of the Venus Express mission, in particular for the ?Visible Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer? (VIRTIS) instrument which will systematically observe these emissions. We present here non-LTE simulations for VIRTIS which demonstrate its capabilities and potential for detecting atmospheric emissions of CO and CO2 under non-LTE, both in limb and nadir observations and we discuss briefly the perspectives to use them in order to improve our understanding of the physics of the upper atmosphere of Venus.}

Averaged spectra from these instruments show a double peak structure which can be explained by the strong solar pumping at 2.7?m of the (1001) and (0201) vibrational states of the major CO2 isotope. After the initial absorption, these CO2 states relax radiatively by emission in the 4.3?m second hot bands, whose R- and P-branches produce such structure. It is shown that an LTE atmosphere could not produce such structure. A good fit to the measured spectra is obtained, particularly with PFS, using the currently assumed non-LTE parameters without special adjustments. Analysis of individual bands contributions, their dependence with the thermal structure and solar zenith angle, and the simulation of the altitude variation of the different non-LTE features are presented and discussed. These results confirm the prediction of the non-LTE model and have allowed to identify the main spectral features observed in PFS and ISO data. The dominant double maxima are due to the second hot bands while the individual lines come from the fundamental band. Also the Q-branch of the first hot band and the absence of emission lines in the center of the fundamental band in the PFS spectrum are well reproduced by the simulations.}

    abstract = {The accuracy of trace gas abundances retrieved from spectrally resolved infrared limb emission measurements relies, among other things, on the appropriate modelling of radiative transfer through the actual atmosphere. We quantify the mapping of several commonly applied simplifications in radiative transfer modelling on the trace gas abundances retrieval error at the example of the Michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding (MIPAS)/environmental satellite (ENVISAT) space borne Fourier transform infra-red limb emission experiment. The Karlsruhe optimized and precise radiative transfer algorithm (KOPRA) which was used as a tool for this study will be introduced. KOPRA supports accurate modelling of the particular instrument requirements of MIPAS and the observation scenarios during the ENVISAT mission, in particular with respect to its viewing direction and its altitude coverage of the atmosphere. We show that disregarding of horizontal temperature inhomogeneities and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, insufficient accuracy in modelling of field-of-view and apodisation effects, and disregarding individual profiles of isotopic species play the key roles in radiative transfer modelling and lead to systematic retrieval errors which can by far exceed the expected random retrieval error caused by measurement noise.}
