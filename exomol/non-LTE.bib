abstract = "The accuracy of trace gas abundances retrieved from spectrally resolved infrared limb emission measurements relies, among other things, on the appropriate modelling of radiative transfer through the actual atmosphere. We quantify the mapping of several commonly applied simplifications in radiative transfer modelling on the trace gas abundances retrieval error at the example of the Michelson interferometer for passive atmospheric sounding (MIPAS)/environmental satellite (ENVISAT) space borne Fourier transform infra-red limb emission experiment. The Karlsruhe optimized and precise radiative transfer algorithm (KOPRA) which was used as a tool for this study will be introduced. KOPRA supports accurate modelling of the particular instrument requirements of MIPAS and the observation scenarios during the ENVISAT mission, in particular with respect to its viewing direction and its altitude coverage of the atmosphere. We show that disregarding of horizontal temperature inhomogeneities and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, insufficient accuracy in modelling of field-of-view and apodisation effects, and disregarding individual profiles of isotopic species play the key roles in radiative transfer modelling and lead to systematic retrieval errors which can by far exceed the expected random retrieval error caused by measurement noise."

	abstract = "CH4 vibrational relaxation in the upper stratospheres of the Giant Planets has been examined. A model was developed for the thermalization of solar energy absorbed under nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) conditions in the CH4 band groups centered at ? ? 1.7, 2.3, and 3.3 ?m. Assuming radiative equilibrium and employing a non-LTE radiative transfer algorithm from J. S. Hogan (1968, Ph.D. dissertation), a range of model atmospheres was produced, reflecting uncertainties in CH4 collisional relaxation rates and their temperature dependences. Nominal models for the Giant Planets indicate that the ratios S/B (source function/Planck function) at 1300 cm?1 (near the center of the CH4 ?4 fundamental) begin to depart significantly from unity at P ? 0.1 mbar total pressure. In the formulation used here, this ratio drops to roughly 0.8 at P = 0.01 mbar. The results show large departures from LTE at lower pressures: for example, S/B < 0.5 at 1 ?bar in all models. Rough estimates of CH4 7.7-?m non-LTE emission resulting from scattered sunlight suggest that it is a negligible component of the 7.7-?m flux emanating from all four planets, with the possible exception of Uranus. At 0.1 mbar, all of the non-LTE models are within 2°K of the LTE reference models. Differences between extreme non-LTE and reference LTE models increase steadily upward, however, reaching about ±20°K at 0.1 ?bar (near the tops of the models). For Uranus, temperature profiles based on stellar occultation measurements are considerably more complex than the models: some of the data exhibit temperature variations having smaller vertical wavelengths and, at some levels, larger amplitudes. These comparisons, however, encompass many uncertainties, both in the non-LTE computations and in the contemplation of a data set that is of good quality but very complex. Requirements for improving the theoretical models are discussed."

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Motivated by both ground- and space-based detections of the sodium doublet in the transmission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres, we revisit the theory and interpretation of sodium lines in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), where collisions are not efficient enough to maintain a Boltzmann distribution for the excited and ground states of the sodium atom. We consider non-Boltzmann distributions that account for the ineffectiveness of collisions. We analyze the sodium doublet in transmission spectra measured at low (HAT-P-1b, HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b, WASP-6b, WASP-17b, and WASP-39b) and high (WASP-49b) spectral resolutions. Nested-sampling retrievals performed on low-resolution optical/visible transmission spectra are unable to break the normalization degeneracy if the spectral continuum is associated with Rayleigh scattering by small cloud particles. Using mock retrievals, we demonstrate that unnormalized ground-based, high-resolution spectra centered on the sodium doublet alone are unable to precisely inform us about the pressure levels probed by the transit chord and hence to identify the region (i.e., thermosphere, exosphere) of the atmosphere being probed. Retrievals performed on the HARPS transmission spectrum of WASP-49b support this conclusion. Generally, we are unable to distinguish between LTE versus NLTE interpretations of the sodium doublet based on the computed Bayesian evidence with the implication that LTE interpretations tend to underestimate the temperature probed by the transit chord. With the current low-resolution data, the sodium line shapes are consistent with Voigt profiles without the need for sub-Lorentzian wings. The retrieved sodium abundances are consistent with being subsolar to solar.}

Averaged spectra from these instruments show a double peak structure which can be explained by the strong solar pumping at 2.7?m of the (1001) and (0201) vibrational states of the major CO2 isotope. After the initial absorption, these CO2 states relax radiatively by emission in the 4.3?m second hot bands, whose R- and P-branches produce such structure. It is shown that an LTE atmosphere could not produce such structure. A good fit to the measured spectra is obtained, particularly with PFS, using the currently assumed non-LTE parameters without special adjustments. Analysis of individual bands contributions, their dependence with the thermal structure and solar zenith angle, and the simulation of the altitude variation of the different non-LTE features are presented and discussed. These results confirm the prediction of the non-LTE model and have allowed to identify the main spectral features observed in PFS and ISO data. The dominant double maxima are due to the second hot bands while the individual lines come from the fundamental band. Also the Q-branch of the first hot band and the absence of emission lines in the center of the fundamental band in the PFS spectrum are well reproduced by the simulations."

Those data, containing a strong non-LTE component, showed a structure in the 4.3-?m spectral region which was challenging for non-LTE models so far. The model used in this work was refined after analysis of Martian CO2 atmospheric emission taken by the ?Planetary Fourier Spectrometer? (PFS) and the ?Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer? (OMEGA) instruments on board Mars Express. Here we show that both the limb and the nadir measurements of the Venus daylight atmosphere taken at 4.3-?m by NIMS can be fitted reasonably well with the revised model. This gives confidence in the usage of such model for the analysis of the Venus Express mission, in particular for the ?Visible Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer? (VIRTIS) instrument which will systematically observe these emissions. We present here non-LTE simulations for VIRTIS which demonstrate its capabilities and potential for detecting atmospheric emissions of CO and CO2 under non-LTE, both in limb and nadir observations and we discuss briefly the perspectives to use them in order to improve our understanding of the physics of the upper atmosphere of Venus."
