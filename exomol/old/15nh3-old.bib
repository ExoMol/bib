Journal = MP,

Volume = {109},

Pages = {2209-2217},
Abstract = {The infrared spectrum of (15)NH(3) has been investigated by
   high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the region of
   the stretching fundamentals. A large number of ro-vibration transitions
   in the 3050-3650 cm(-1) spectral range has been recorded and assigned to
   the fundamentals nu(1) and nu(3), and to the 2 nu(4) overtone bands. In
   total, 1606 transitions involving the (s) and (a)
   inversion-rotation-vibration levels have been identified and assigned.
   They include 256 perturbation-allowed transitions with selection rules
   Delta K = +/- 2, Delta l = -1 in nu(3) and Delta l = +2 in 2 nu(+/-
   2)(4), and Delta K = +/- 3, Delta l = 0 in nu(1) and 2 nu(0)(4). All
   assigned transitions were fitted simultaneously to a model Hamiltonian
   that includes all symmetry-allowed interactions between and within the
   excited state levels in order to obtain accurate sets of spectroscopic
   parameters for both inversion states. The standard deviation of the fit,
   0.034 cm(-1), is about 70 times larger than the estimated measurement
   precision. This result is similar to that reported for the same band
   system in (14)NH(3) by Kleiner et al. {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc. 193, 46
   (1999)] and is a consequence of the neglect of vibration and
   ro-vibration interactions between the analysed states and vibrationally
   excited states with close energies.},

Abstract = {This paper is concerned with an analysis of the high resolution spectra
   of the fundamental nu(2) band of both (15)NH(2)D and (15)ND(2)H.
   Absorption spectra were recorded in the 690-1150 cm(-1) region with a
   Fourier transform spectrometer. The assignment of the nu(2) band
   transitions and a theoretical analysis of the
   vibration-inversion-rotation energy levels involved with these
   transitions were performed for both species. The first determination of
   the spectroscopic constants relevant to the symmetric and antisymmetric
   upper inversion substates of the fundamental nu(2) band was carried out.

Title = {New VISTA on ammonia in the 1.5 mu m region: Assignments for the nu(3)+2
   nu(4) bands of (NH3)-N-14 and (NH3)-N-15 by isotopic shift labeling},
Journal = JMS,

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Further insight into the manifold of vibrational combination and
   overtone bands in the 1.5 mu m infrared spectrum of ammonia has been
   obtained using a vibrational isotopic shift technique for assignment
   (VISTA), a simple stratagem for classifying spectral lines into their
   respective absorption bands from their fingerprint isotopic shifts. In a
   comparison of spectra of (NH3)-N-14 and (NH3)-N-15 recorded from 6400 to
   6808 cm(-1) with a tunable diode laser spectrometer, we have exploited
   isotopic shift labeling to identify lines of the nu(3) + 2 nu(4)
   asymmetric stretch-bend combination band for both species. Line
   positions, inversion and l-doublet splittings, and nu(3) + 2 nu(4)
   parameter estimates from isolated-state fits are reported for the two
   isotopologues. This band accounts for the majority of strong ammonia
   lines with unreported assignments in the important 1.5 pm spectral
   window for environmental monitoring and remote sensing. An interesting
   coincidence is that the P-p(6, 6) inversion doublet for each of the
   nu(3) + 2 nu(4), nu(1) + nu(3), v,l + 2 nu(4) and nu(3) + nu(4) bands
   turns out to have been involved in previous (NH3)-N-14 monitoring
   studies, most notably for the much-studied nu(1) + nu(3) feature at 1.53
   17 mu m or 6528.77 cm(-1) which we now find to be a close blend of a
   P-p(6, 6) component with the known P-p(5, 3)a line. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {The infrared spectrum of the (NH3)-N-15 isotopic species of ammonia has
   been investigated in the 6370-6800 cm(-1) region of the nu(1) + nu(3)
   N-H stretching combination band with an external cavity tunable diode
   laser (ECTDL) spectrometer. A group of the stronger absorption lines
   form a pattern that is systematically shifted downwards by 12.2 cm(-1)
   from a closely similar pattern of known transitions in the nu(1)+nu(3)
   band of normal (NH3)-N-14, allowing immediate line assignments. This
   isotopic shift is almost exactly compensated by changes in rotational
   energy such that the R-r{[}(J + 1)(kappa+1)] and (p){[}(J-1)(kappa-1)]
   transitions of (NH3)-N-15 lie very close to the (NH3)-N-14 R-r{[}J(K)]
   and P-p{[}J(K)] transitions, respectively, giving a convenient
   comparison of relative intensity. From spectra of a 50:50 mixture of the
   two species, the absorption strengths appear comparable, with a slightly
   greater transition moment for (NH3)-N-15. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) on the Cassini spacecraft
   made infrared observations of Jupiter's atmosphere during the flyby of
   2000 December to 2001 January. The unique database in the 600-1400
   cm(-1) region with 0.53 and 2.8 cm(-1) spectral resolutions obtained
   from the observations permits retrieval of global maps of the thermal
   structure and composition of Jupiter's atmosphere, including the
   distributions of (NH3)-N-14 and (NH3)-N-15. Analysis of Jupiter's
   ammonia distributions from three isolated (NH3)-N-15 spectral lines in
   eight latitudes is presented for evaluation of the nitrogen isotopic
   ratio. The nitrogen isotopic ratio N-14/N-15 (or N-15/N-14) in Jupiter's
   atmosphere in this analysis is calculated to be 448 +/- 62 {[}or (2.23
   +/- 0.31) x 10(-3)]. This value of the ratio determined from CIRS data
   is found to be in very close agreement with the value previously
   obtained from the measurements by the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer.
   Some possible mechanisms to account for the variation of Jupiter's
   observed isotopic ratio relative to those of various astrophysical
   environments are discussed.},
