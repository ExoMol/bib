Abstract = {In order to assess the relative importance of the intrinsic error in
   high-level conventional ab initio methods and errors inherent in the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation, benchmark quality potential curves and
   spectroscopic constants have been computed for the light diatomic
   hydrides H-2, LiH, BeH, and BH. The intrinsic error is found to be
   comparable to or smaller than the nonadiabatic effects. Revised
   spectroscopic constants are proposed for BeH. BH is predicted to have
   an unusually large nonadiabatic contribution of about 0.0025 Angstrom
   to its bond length. Previous arguments favoring the use of atomic
   rather than nuclear masses are further corroborated. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Pages = {76-83},
Abstract = {{BeH is one of the most important benchmark systems for ab initio methods
   and for studying Born-Oppenheimer breakdown. However the best empirical
   potential and best ab initio potential for the ground electronic state
   to date give drastically different predictions in the long-range region
   between where the highest measurements have been made, and the
   dissociation energy; a region which is about similar to 1000 cm(-1) for
   (BeH)-Be-9, similar to 3000 cm(-1) for (BeD)-Be-9, and similar to 13 000
   cm(-1) for (BeT)-Be-9. Improved empirical potentials and
   Born-Oppenheimer breakdown corrections have now been built in this work
   for the ground electronic states X(1(2)Sigma(+)) of all three
   isotopologues. The predicted dissociation energy for (BeH)-Be-9 from the
   new empirical potential is now in agreement with the current best ab
   initio prediction in all 5 digits of the former's precision, while the
   previous best empirical potential was in disagreement by 74 cm(-1). The
   previous best empirical potential predicted the existence of unobserved
   vibrational levels for all three isotopologues, and the current best ab
   initio study also predicted the existence of all of these levels, and 7
   more in total. With the exception of two, the present empirical
   potential agrees with the existence of all of the ab initio potentials'
   extra levels not predicted by the earlier empirical potential. With one
   exception, all energy spacings between vibrational energy levels for
   which measurements have been made, are predicted with an agreement of
   better than 1 cm(-1) between the new empirical potential and the current
   best ab initio potential, but some predictions for unobserved levels are
   still in great disagreement, and the equilibrium bond lengths are
   different by orders of magnitude. }},

Title = {Full configuration interaction calculation of BeH adiabatic states},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {129},
Abstract = {An all-electron full configuration interaction (FCI) calculation of the
   adiabatic potential energy curves of some of the lower states of BeH
   molecule is presented. A moderately large ANO basis set of atomic
   natural orbitals (ANO) augmented with Rydberg functions has been used
   in order to describe the valence and Rydberg states and their
   interactions. The Rydberg set of ANOs has been placed on the Be at all
   bond distances. So, the basis set can be described as
   4s3p2d1f/3s2p1d(Be/H)+4s4p2d(Be). The dipole moments of several states
   and transition dipole strengths from the ground state are also reported
   as a function of the RBe-H distance. The position and the number of
   states involved in several avoided crossings present in this system
   have been discussed. Spectroscopic parameters have been calculated from
   a number of the vibrational states that result from the adiabatic
   curves except for some states in which this would be completely
   nonsense, as it is the case for the very distorted curves of the 3s and
   3p (2)Sigma(+) states or the double-well potential of the 4p (2)Pi
   state. The so-called ``D complex{''} at 54 050 cm(-1) (185.0 nm) is
   resolved into the three 3d substates ((2)Sigma(+),(2)Pi,(2)Delta). A
   diexcited valence state is calculated as the lowest state of
   (2)Sigma(-) symmetry and its spectroscopic parameters are reported, as
   well as those of the 2 (2)Delta (4d) state The adiabatic curve of the 4
   (2)Sigma(+) state shows a swallow well at large distances (around 4.1
   angstrom) as a result of an avoided crossing with the 3 (2)Sigma(+)
   state. The probability that some vibrational levels of this well could
   be populated is discussed within an approached Landau-Zerner model and
   is found to be high. No evidence is found of the E(4s sigma)
   (2)Sigma(+) state in the region of the ``D complex{''}. Instead, the
   spectroscopic properties obtained from the (4s sigma) 6 (2)Sigma(+)
   adiabatic curve of the present work seem to agree with those of the
   experimental F(4p sigma) (2)Sigma(+) state. The FCI calculations
   provide benchmark results for other correlation models for the
   open-shell BeH system and evidence both the limitations and
   capabilities of the basis set. },

done for the low-lying excited states at nine different internuclear separations. Potential energy curves were plotted. The transition energy obtained (2JI->22:) was found to be within 1.3% of the experimental value.

v' = 0 for BeD, allows one to derive molecular constants for the new C'z' state. The latter has a largc intcrnuclear equilibrium
distance (r, = 2.301 A) and a shallow potential energy minimum (D: = 8452 2 100 cm I ) . The principal molecular constants
determined are:

Rotational perturbations between the C'C' and ~ ' 1 ~sta1te s are observed in the C-X bands of BeH and BeD and in two new
A-X bands of BeH (4-4 and 5-5) which have also been observed and analyzed. These perturbations are treated by a matrix
approach and yield a value for the interaction matrix element ( A ' ~ / L ' I C ~ C ' ) = 0.88.
The C-X bands analyzed involve the higher vibrational levels of the x'C' state rand allow, therefore, a substantial
improvement of the ground state molecular constants to be made and a good Rydbcrg-Klein-Rees (RKR) potential energy
curve to be calculated. The limiting curve of the predissociation confirms the previous value of the dissociation energy (D:

Year = {2000},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {4027-4036},
Abstract = {Using a linear-response approach, the recently introduced
   spin-restricted coupled-cluster (SR-CC) theory is extended to the
   treatment of excited states of high-spin open-shell molecules. Explicit
   equations are given within the usual singles and doubles approximation
   and our implementation (within an existing spin-orbital code) is
   described. It is shown that in SR-CC theory, due to spin constraints,
   the spin-expectation value for the excited states calculated as
   corresponding energy derivatives always corresponds to the exact value.
   In addition, the SR-CC singles and doubles (SR-CCSD) approach is
   extended to include also the so-called pseudotriple excitations (best
   described as double excitations with an additional spin-flip in one
   open-shell orbital) which are important for the description of so-called
   low-spin excited states. Exploratory calculations for a few diatomic
   systems (BeH, OH, NO, CN, and CO(+)) show that problems due to spin
   contamination in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) CCSD treatment of
   excited states are rectified by using a restricted open-shell
   Hartree-Fock (ROHF) reference, as it is done in the SR-CC approach.
   While SR-CCSD performs well for high-spin excited states, the closely
   related partially spin-adapted (PSA) CC approach is shown to be inferior
   and errors in the computed excitation energies are generally larger than
   the typical accuracy of about 0.2 eV in CCSD excited state treatments.
   So-called low-spin states (e.g., the 2 (2)B(1) state of NH(2)) are shown
   to require inclusion of pseudotriple excitations for even a
   qualitatively correct description. If they are included, ROHF-CC, SR-CC,
   and PSA-CC give essentially identical results. (C) 2000 American

The later mechanism has been clearly identified by the appearance of BeD A–X emission and quantified in cause of a temperature dependence at which the BeD practically vanishes at highest observed Be limiter temperatures. The recorded T surf dependence, obtained in a series of 34 identical discharges with ratch-up of T surf by plasma impact and inertial cooling after the discharge, revealed that the reduction of BeD is correlated with an increase of D 2 emission. The release mechanism of deuterium in the Be interaction layer is exchanged under otherwise constant recycling flux conditions at the limiter.

The chemical assisted physical sputtering, always present at the nominal limiter pre-heating temperature of T surf = 200 °C, is associated with an additional sputtering channel with respect to ordinary physical sputtering which is surface temperature independent. These JET experiments in limiter configuration are used to benchmark the ERO code and verify ITER first wall erosion prediction. The ERO code overestimates the observed Be sputtering in JET by a factor of about 2.5 which can be transferred to ITER predictions and prolong the expected lifetime of first wall elements.}

   than T-r for CD and C-2. The BeD spectrum time history during a pulse
   (modulated by sweeping) appears as localized emission from the strike
   points similar to that of the atomic Bet visible spectrum lines. On the
   other hand, the CD bands during a swept pulse: indicate a more
   distributed source. Thus both the BeD spectrum and time history suggest
   physical sputtering of BeD at the strike points. In contrast, the CD
   spectrum and time history indicate chemical release of higher deuterides
   followed by catabolism to CD. This work constitutes the first detailed
   study of diatomic species in the JET tokamak.},

Abstract = {This paper is the first part of a series devoted to the ab initio
   calculation of some vibrational properties helpful in the interpretation
   of high resolution spectroscopy, atmospherical and astrophysical data.
   An ab initio method of calculation of the vibrational transition
   energies and dipole moment matrix elements is described and analyzed.
   The main features of this method are the resolution of both electronic
   and vibrational problems by analytical variational techniques and the
   representation of the potential energy and dipole moment hypersurfaces
   as Taylor's series expansions in normal coordinates up to the fourth
   order. The dipole moment matrix elements are then evaluated by simple
   analytical formulae. In this first paper, some of the approximations
   inherent to the methodology are systematically analyzed on the basis of
   results obtained for diatomic molecules (BeH, HF, NH and NO) with a
   comparison to experimental and other theoretical results found in the
   literature. The dependence on the results of the effects of electrical
   and mechanical anharmonicities, electron correlation and basis set
   dependencies are investigated. The applicability of the method to small
   polyatomic systems is discussed in the second paper of this series, on
   the basis of test calculations on the water molecule.},

Abstract = {Using the natural bond orbital method, one may associate the valence

   help understand the nature of the bonding in this open shell species.
   The contrasting behavior of the bonding orbitals for different spins can
   be attributed to differences in the Pauli repulsive interactions with
   the lone-pair orbitals. Such behavior occurs in BeH(2-SIGMA) but does
   not in CO+(2-PI) because the Pauli repulsion depends on the orbital

Journal = ZPD,
Year = {1996},
Volume = {36},
Pages = {301-309},
Abstract = {Electron-spin magnetic moments, in the form of g-shifts, have been
   computed at the ROHF level for the X(2) Sigma(+) states of LiH+, BeH2+,
   LiH-, BeH and BH+. A perturbative approach, complete to second-order in
   appropriate Breit-Pauli operators, has been used. Retention of
   two-centre integrals has proven vital. First-order terms are important,
   especially in describing the negative g(1) shifts observed
   experimentally in (2) Sigma(+) molecules. The relativistic mass
   correction dominates in first-order, except for LiH- where the
   two-electron spin-Zeeman gauge correction supersedes. Second-order terms
   contribute negatively, and only to the Delta g(perpendicular to)
   component. Along the isoelectronic series LIH(-) --> BeH --> BH+, the
   magnitude of Delta g(perpendicular to) increases due to the dependence
   of spin-orbit coupling on nuclear charge. The relation of g-shifts to
   electronic structure and bonding is explored.},

Abstract = {The accurate ground-state potential energy function of beryllium

   calculations using the multi-reference averaged coupled-pair functional
   (MR-ACPF) method in conjunction with the correlation-consistent
   core-valence basis sets up to septuple-zeta quality. The effects of
   electron correlation beyond the MR-ACPF level of approximation were
   taken into account. The scalar relativistic and adiabatic (the diagonal
   correction) effects, as well as some of the nonadiabatic effects, were
   also discussed. The vibration-rotation energy levels of three
   isotopologues, BeH, BeD, and BeT, were predicted to sub-cm(-1) accuracy.},

Title = {A search for absorption of Mg and Ca compounds in molecular clouds

Journal = MNRAS,
Year = {1998},
Volume = {301},
Pages = {872-880},
Abstract = {Absorption lines of MgH and CaH N = 1 - 0 transitions were searched For
   in foreground molecular clouds towards the continuum sources associated
   with Sgr B2 (M) and W49A (N). None of these Lines was detected with our
   sensitivity level of similar to 20 mK, Millimetric absorption lines of
   MgO, MgOH, CaO and CaOH were also searched for towards Sgr B2 (M)
   without success. The fractional abundances relative to molecular
   hydrogen are less than or similar to 1.0 x 10(-11) for MgH, less than or
   similar to 7.9 x 10(-13) for MgO, less than or similar to 1.6 x 10(-10)
   for MgOH, less than or similar to 1.6 x 10(-9) for CaH, less than or
   similar to 2.0 x 10(-12) for CaO, and less than or similar to 2.5 x
   10(-10) for CaOH, respectively. The low abundances measured in
   absorption indicate that a significant fraction of interstellar
   magnesium and calcium cannot be tied up in their monohydrides, monoxides
   and monohydroxides. The law abundance of MgH also implies that
   grain-surface chemistry involving magnesium is not efficient and that
   magnesium is depleted on to grains to a factor of greater than or
   similar to 10(2.5) in well-shielded molecular clouds.},
