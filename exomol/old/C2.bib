  abstract={We analyzed archival spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope for a study of interstellar C 2 . Absorption from the electronic transitions, D 1 Σ + u - X 1 Σ + g (0,0) as well as F 1 Π u - X 1 Σ + g (0,0) and (1,0), was the focus of the study. Our profile syntheses revealed that the lines of the F – X bands were broadened as a result of a perturbation involving the upper levels. Further evidence for the perturbation came from anomalies in line strength and position for the F – X (0,0) band. The perturbation likely arises from a combination of triplet-singlet interactions involving spin-orbit mixing between 3 Π u states and F 1 Π u and an avoided crossing between the 3 Π u states. Tunneling through a potential barrier caused by the 3 and 4 1 Π u states and spin-orbit mixing with other close-lying triplet states of ungerade symmetry are less likely. Except for the broadening, lines in the F – X (1,0) band appear free from anomalies and can be used to study interstellar C 2 ; new results for 10 sight lines are presented.}

   STATES E1-SIGMA-G+ OF C2 AND 2(2)SIGMA-G+ OF C2+},
Journal = JPC,
Year = {1992},

Abstract = {The radiative properties of the doubly-excited states
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2) of C2 and
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) of C2+ are investigated
   theoretically by using MRD-CI wave functions.  Due to a heavy mixing
   between bonding and antibonding configurations, the E state (with a
   maximum contribution of sigma(u)2 --> sigma(g)2 of 45\%) does not show
   the typical features of strongly bound states (short R(e) and high
   omega(e)).  Because of the mixing, the experimental Freymark system
   E(1)SIGMA(g)+ - A(1)PI(u) of C2 exhibits a moderate intensity though.
   At R = 2.43 bohr (an intermediate geometry between both minima), a
   calculated transition moment SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.151 au2 disagrees
   with an experimental estimate of 2.26 +/- 1.13 au2 from Cooper and
   Nicholls.  The same authors assigned to the Mulliken band D(1)SIGMA(u)+
   - X(1)SIGMA(g)+ of C2 a SIGMA-R(e'e'')2 of 0.13 +/- 0.05 au2, whereas
   this work and earlier data from the literature indicate a higher value
   of 0.41 au2 for that quantity.  A total radiative lifetime tau(0)
   almost-equal-to 15 ns for the E(1)SIGMA(g)+ state is mainly dicated by
   the radiative process E --> A, the competitive decay E --> D being
   about 10 times slower.  The 2(2)SIGMA(g)+(sigma(u)2 --> pi(u)2) state
   of C2+ is strongly bound, with a shortening DELTA-R(e) = 0.35 bohr and
   an increase DELTA-omega(e) almost-equal-to 800 cm-1 (60\%) relative to
   the X(4)SIGMA(g)- ground state.  A lifetime tau(0)(2(2)SIGMA(g)+)
   almost-equal-to 28 ns results from radiative decay into both
   1(2)SIGMA(u)+ and 2(2)PI(u) states.  On the basis of the present
   spectroscopic data for C2+, an absorption band observed at 2.77 eV
   (assumed as belonging to C2) is tentatively reassigned to the
   2(2)SIGMA(g)+ <-- 1(2)SIGMA(u)+ transition of C2+, with a calculated
   DELTA-E00 = 2.81 eV.},

Journal = JCP,
Year = {1992},

Pages = {6073-6084},
Abstract = {Coupled-cluster methods including effects of triple excitations have
   been used with large basis sets to study several electronic states of
   C2, C2-, and C2+. r(e), omega(e), D(e), and T(e) have been computed for
   each state considered.  For those states for which experimental data
   are available, the errors are typically less than 0.002 angstrom, 20
   cm-1, and 0.1 eV for r(e), omega(e), and D(e), respectively.  These
   errors are comparable with the best previous results on C2 and
   significantly smaller than those for previous calculations on C2- and
   C2+.  For T(e) the results are also satisfactory and comparable with
   previous work, but some difficulties arise when one or both of the
   states have considerable multireference character.  For two states of
   C2+ not experimentally characterized, the present data should be
   sufficiently accurate to be of some assistance to experimental studies.
    The electron affinity of the ground state of C2 and the ionization
   potentials of the ground and first excited states of C2 have been
   computed, and particular attention has been given to correlation errors
   in these quantities.  It has been shown that triple excitations
   significantly decrease the electron affinity.  By neglecting or taking
   insufficient account of triple excitations, some previous calculations
   were biased towards the anion and obtained fortuitously good agreement
   with experiment.  The correlation error of the present calculations is
   such that the calculations are slightly biased towards the neutral
   molecule, but the error is only 0.2 eV.  For the ionization potentials,
   too, triple excitations play an important role.  Reasonable agreement
   with experiment has been achieved by the present calculations.
   Overall, the present study:  (1) underscores the importance of triple
   excitations; (2) shows the success of single-reference couple-cluster
   theory in calculating properties of a single state, even when that
   state has considerable multireference character; and (3) highlights the
   care which must be taken when comparing different electronic states
   with these methods when one or both states have considerable
   multireference character.},

Abstract = {We report ab initio spectroscopic constants for the recently identified

   of experiment. Agreement with available spectroscopic data is
   excellent, with the calculations strongly suggesting that the 1(5)Pi(g)

Abstract = {Unusual bonding and electronic near degeneracies make the lowest-lying
   singlet states of the C-2 molecule particularly challenging for

   to modeling bond-breaking reactions and excited states: sophisticated
   multireference configuration interaction and multireference
   perturbation theory methods, and a more ``black box,{''}
   single-reference approach, the completely renormalized coupled-cluster

   6-31G({*}) basis set. Both the multireference methods and the
   completely renormalized coupled-cluster approach provide dramatic
   improvements over the standard single-reference methods. The
   multireference methods are nearly as reliable for this challenging test
   case as for simpler reactions which break only single bonds. The
   completely renormalized coupled-cluster approach has difficulty for
   large internuclear separations R in this case, but over the wide range

Abstract = {The potential curves of selected valence and Rydberg states of C-2

   (1-3)(3)Sigma (+)(g), (2-5)(3)Sigma (g-), (1-3)(3)(g), and relevant
   quintet stares. The f (3)Sigmag(-), g(3)Deltag and F (1)Pi (u) states

   originally been assumed to be pi (u) --> 3s Rydberg states, with
   respect to a (3)Pi (u)(1 (3)Pi (u)) for the triplets and to X(1)Sigma
   (+)(g) for the singlet. Our calculations partially support such

   0.027 for f <-- a, 0.051 for g <-- a, and 0.098 for F <-- X. The
   singlet-singlet transition F <-- X constitutes the strongest absorption
   band reported so far for C-2. Our theoretical value agrees with f(00)(F

   The vibrational energies and rotational constants of the upper e

Journal = ApJS,

Volume = {169},
Number = {2},
Pages = {472-484},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The C-2 Swan system (d(3)Pi(g)-a(3)Pi(u)) was observed in emission for
   the Delta v = -3 to Delta v = +2 sequences in the 14,000-24,000 cm(-1)
   spectral range using a Fourier transform spectrometer. We carried out a
   global simultaneous fit by including a wide range of vibrational states.
   A total of 34 bands with v' = 0-10 and v `' = 0-9 were rotationally
   assigned. Numerous discrepancies were found in the assignments and in
   the measured transition wavenumbers between the new measurements and
   previous results. Most of the measured transition wavenumbers and their
   assignments for relatively low-v bands agreed with published data. On
   the contrary, for high-v bands our line positions and assignments
   disagreed with the tabulated literature values. In particular, the lines
   of six bands involving the levels with v' = 4, 5, and 6 are almost
   completely different from the previous work. Major sources of the
   disagreement are thought to be line congestion and perturbations found
   in these bands. From the analysis, perturbations for v' = 0, 1, 2, 4, 6,
   8, 9, and 10 in the d(3)Pi(g) state were identified. A study of these
   rotational perturbations suggest that some of them are likely caused by
   interactions with high-v levels of the b (3)Sigma(-)(g) state.}}

Title = {{C-2 in peculiar DQ white dwarfs}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{678}},
Pages = {1292-1297},
Abstract = {{White dwarfs (WDs) with carbon absorption features in their optical
   spectra are known as DQ WDs. The subclass of peculiar DQ WDs are cool
   objects (T-eff less than or similar to 6000 K) that show molecular
   absorption bands that have centroid wavelengths similar to 100-300
   angstrom shortward of the bandheads of the C-2 Swan bands. These
   ``peculiar DQ bands'' have been attributed to a hydrocarbon such as C2H.
   We point out that C2H does not show strong absorption bands with
   wavelengths matching those of the peculiar DQ bands, and neither does
   any other simple molecule or ion likely to be present in a cool WD
   atmosphere. C-2 seems to be the only reasonable candidate for producing
   the peculiar DQ bands. Many characteristics of those bands can be
   understood if they are pressure-shifted Swan bands. While current models
   of WD atmospheres suggest that, in general, peculiar DQ WDs do not have
   higher photospheric pressures than normal DQ WDs do, that finding
   requires confirmation by improved models of WD atmospheres and of the
   behavior of C-2 at high pressures and temperatures. If it is eventually
   shown that the peculiar DQ bands cannot be explained as pressure shifted
   Swan bands, the only explanation remaining would seem to be that they
   arise from highly rotationally excited C-2 (J(peak) greater than or
   similar to 45). In either case, the absorption band profiles can in
   principle be used to constrain the pressure and the rotational
   temperature of C-2 in the line-forming regions of normal and peculiar DQ
   WD atmospheres, which will be useful for comparison with models.
   Finally, we note that progress in understanding magnetic DQ WDs may
   require models that simultaneously consider magnetic fields, high
   pressures, and rotational excitation of C-2.}},

   number of rotational lines accurately constrains the gas-kinetic
   temperature T and the density n to T = 35 K and n = (600 +/- 100)
   cm(-3). The inferred C-2 column density is N(C-2) = (20(-2)(+4)) 10(13)
   cm(-2). The detection of various lines in the (1,0) and (2,0) band of
   the CN A(2)II(u) -X(2)Sigma (+) red system suggest a column density of
   N(CN) = (8-13) x 10(13) cm(-2). C-2 absorption lines are also detected
   towards Cyg OB2 No. 5 and No. 9. Inferred parameters are T = 50K, n =

   towards Cyg OB2 No. 8A indicate N(C-2) approximate to 3.3 x 10(13)

   equal to 3.3 x 10(13) cm(-2) toward Cyg OB2 No. 7 and No. 11. The C-2
   observations eliminate the possibility that the molecular material along
   the line of sight towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 is spread over a pathlength of
   several hundred parsecs of very low density n approximate to 10 cm(-3).
   The observations provide some support to a recent chemical model which
   assumes a nested structure of the molecular gas. Alternatively, the C2
   and CN abundances obtained towards Cyg OB2 No. 12 are in agreement with
   the predictions of an X-ray induced chemistry driven by an ionisation
   rate of zeta = (0.6-3) x 10(-15) s(-1). Calculated equilibrium

Abstract = {{Diatomic carbon, C-2, has been variously described as having a double,
   triple, or quadruple bond. In this article, we report full generalized
   valence bond (GVB) calculations on C-2. The GVB wave function-more
   accurate than the Hartree-Fock wave function and easier to interpret
   than traditional multiconfiguration wave functions is well-suited for
   characterizing the bonding in C-2. The GVB calculations show that the
   electronic wave function of C2 is not well described by a product of
   singlet-coupled, shared electron pairs (perfect pairing), which is the
   theoretical basis for covalent chemical bonds. Rather, C-2 is best
   described as having a traditional covalent a bond with the electrons in
   the remaining orbitals of the two carbon atoms antiferromagnetically
   coupled. However, even this description is incomplete as the perfect
   pairing spin function also makes a significant contribution to the full
   GVB wave function. The complicated structure of the wave function of C-2
   is the source of the uncertainty about the nature of the bonding in this
   molecule.}},

Title = {{Accurate ab initio potential energy curves and spectroscopic properties
   of the four lowest singlet states of C-2}},
Journal = TCA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{133}},
pages = {1425},
Abstract = {{The diatomic carbon molecule has a complex electronic structure with a
   large number of low-lying electronic excited states. In this work, the
   potential energy curves (PECs) of the four lowest lying singlet states
   (X-1 Sigma(+)(g), A(1)Pi(u), B-1 Delta(g), and B'(1)Sigma(+)(g)) were
   obtained by high-level ab initio calculations. Valence electron
   correlation was accounted for by the correlation energy extrapolation by
   intrinsic scaling (CEEIS) method. Additional corrections to the PECs
   included core-valence correlation and relativistic effects. Spin-orbit
   corrections were found to be insignificant. The impact of using
   dynamically weighted reference wave functions in conjunction with CEEIS
   was examined and found to give indistinguishable results from the even
   weighted method. The PECs showed multiple curve crossings due to the B-1
   Delta(g) state as well as an avoided crossing between the two
   (1)Sigma(+)(g) states. Vibrational energy levels were computed for each
   of the four electronic states, as well as rotational constants and
   spectroscopic parameters. Comparison between the theoretical and
   experimental results showed excellent agreement overall. Equilibrium
   bond distances are reproduced to within 0.05 \%. The dissociation
   energies of the states agree with experiment to within similar to 0.5
   kcal/mol, achieving ``chemical accuracy.{''} Vibrational energy levels
   show average deviations of similar to 20 cm(-1) or less. The B-1
   Delta(g) state shows the best agreement with a mean absolute deviation
   of 2.41 cm(-1). Calculated rotational constants exhibit very good
   agreement with experiment, as do the spectroscopic constants.}},

Abstract = {{The emission spectrum of BN has been investigated in the 1800-9000
   cm(-1) region using a Fourier transform spectrometer. BN was formed in a
   microwave discharge of He with a trace of BCl3 and N-2. The bands
   observed in the 3000-7800 cm(-1) interval have been assigned as the b(1)
   Pi-a(1) Sigma(+) transition, with the 0-0 band at 3513.99040(43) cm(-1).
   This transition is analogous to the A(1) Pi(u)-X(1) Sigma(g) (Phillips)
   system of the isoelectronic C-2 molecule. The rotational analysis of the
   0-0, 1-1, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 2-0, 3-1, 4-2, and 4-1 bands has been obtained
   and the molecular constants for the b(1) Pi and a(1) Sigma(+) states
   have been determined. A local perturbation has been observed in the v =
   1 vibrational level of the b(1) Pi state near J = 18 caused by the
   interaction with the v = 3 vibrational level of the a(1) Sigma(+) state.
   The principal equilibrium constants for the a(1) Sigma(+) state are:
   omega(e) = 1705.4032(11) cm(-1), omega(e)x(e) = 10.55338(52) cm(-1), B-e

Abstract = {{The Swan (d 3PI(g)-a 3PI(u)) system of the C2 molecule was produced in a
   jet-cooled corona excited supersonic expansion of helium using
   diazoacetonitrile as a precursor molecule. This spectrum was recorded
   using the McMath Fourier transform spectrometer of the National Solar
   Observatory at Kitt Peak. A total of nine bands with v' = 0 to 3 and v''
   = 0 to 4 in the range 16,570-22,760 cm-1 were observed and rotationally
   analyzed. The C2 molecules in this source had a rotational temperature
   of only 90 K so that only the low-J lines were present in the spectrum.
   In some sense the low temperatures in the jet source simulate conditions
   in the interstellar medium. The Swan system of C2 was also produced in a
   composite wall hollow cathode made Al4C3/Cu, and the rotational
   structure of the 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 0-0, and 1-1 bands were analyzed. The
   data obtained from both these spectra were fitted together along with
   some recently published line positions. The rotational constants, lambda
   doubling parameters and the vibrational constants were estimated from
   this global fit. Our work on jet-cooled C2 follows similar work on the
   violet and red systems of CN. A summary of this CN work is also
