  abstract = {A one-dimensional local bend model is used to describe the variation
	of electronic properties of acetylene in vibrational levels that
	embody large amplitude local motions on the S-0 potential energy
	surface. Calculations performed at the CCSD(T) and MR-AQCC levels
	of theory predict an approximately linear dependence of the dipole
	moment on the number of quanta in either the local bending or local
	stretching excitation. In the local mode limit, one quantum of stretching
	excitation in one CH bond leads to an increase of 0.025 D in the
	dipole moment, and one quantum of bending vibration in the CCH angle
	leads to an increase of 0.068 D. The use of a one-dimensional model
	for the local bend is justified by comparison to the well-established
	polyad model which reveals a decoupling of the large amplitude bending
	from other degrees of freedom in the range of N-bend = 14-22. We
	find that the same one-dimensional large amplitude bending motion
	emerges from two profoundly different representations, a one-dimensional
	cut through an ab initio, seven-dimensional Hamiltonian and the three-dimensional
	(l = 0) pure-bending experimentally parametrized spectroscopic Hamiltonian.},

Abstract = {Recently, a high temperature source has been used to produce high
   temperature emission spectra of acetylene in the 3 pm spectral range,
   under Doppler limited resolution, and the complete spectral assignment
   has been performed using a global rovibrational Hamiltonian {[}Amyay B,

   Vibration-rotation pattern in acetylene (II): Introduction to Coriolis
   coupling in the global model and analysis of emission spectra of hot
   acetylene around 3 mu m. J Chem Phys 2009;131:114301]. The present
   investigation focuses on the relative emission line intensities which
   are observed to be affected. The strongest lines intensity may be
   considerably reduced for high column density acetylene samples, hence
   affecting the 3:1 ortho:para intensity ratio. A radiative model is
   developed to take into account the effects generated by the strong
   opacity of the acetylene samples including self-absorption and
   absorption of the radiation emitted by the hot environment. The model is
   used to extract the absolute concentration of the high temperature
   acetylene samples from the observed relative spectral intensities. The
   relevance of the procedure for infrared remote sensing in high
   temperature astrophysical environments, such as circumstellar envelopes
   of cool carbon rich evolved stars, is discussed.}}

Title = {Accurate partition function for acetylene, (C2H2)-C-12, and related
   thermodynamical quantities},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {135},
pages  = {234305},
Abstract = {The internal partition function (Q(int)) of ethyne (acetylene),
   (C2H2)-C-12, is calculated by explicit summation of the contribution of
   all individual vibration-rotation energy levels up to 15 000 cm(-1). The
   corresponding energies are predicted from a global model and constants
   reproducing within 3 sigma all 18 415 published vibration-rotation lines
   in the literature involving vibrational states up to 8900 cm(-1), as
   produced by Amyay et al. {[}J. Mol. Spectrosc. 267, 80 (2011)]. Values
   of Q(int), with distinct calculations for para and ortho species are
   provided from 1 to 2000 K, in step of 1 K. The total internal partition
   function at 298.15 K is 104.224387(47) or 416.89755(19), with the
   nuclear degeneracy spin factors taken as 1/4:3/4 (astronomer convention)
   or 1: 3 (atmospheric convention), respectively, for para: ortho species.
   The Helmholtz function, Gibbs enthalpy function, entropy, and specific
   heat at constant pressure are also calculated over the same temperature
   range. Accuracies as well as the missing contribution of the vinylidene
   isomer of acetylene in the calculations are discussed.}}
