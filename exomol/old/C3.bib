Abstract = {{The smallest polyatomic carbon chain, C-3, has been identified in
   interstellar clouds (A(upsilon)similar to 1 mag) toward zeta Ophiuchi,
   20 Aquilae and zeta Persei by detection of the origin band in its
   A(1)II(u)-X(1)Sigma (+)(g) electronic transition, near 4052 Angstrom.
   Individual rotational lines were resolved up to J = 30, allowing the
   rotational-level column densities and temperature distributions to be
   determined. The inferred limits for the total column densities (similar
   to1-2 x 10(12) cm(-2)) offer a strong incentive to laboratory and
   astrophysical searches for the longer carbon chains. Concurrent searches
   for C-2(+), C-2(-), and C-3(-) were negative, but provide sensitive
   estimates for their maximum column densities.}}

Abstract = {We report here the first observation of the D (1)Delta(g) state of the C-3 radical, which provides the first comprehensively analyzed example
   of the dynamic Renner-Teller splitting in Delta symmetry. Two color
   double resonance spectroscopy via the A (1)Pi(u) state was employed to
   experimentally probe an extensive range of vibronic levels in this D
   (1)Delta(g) state, covering all three modes of vibration of C-3. The
   analysis was supported by ab initio potential energy surface
   calculations on the C-3 radical to outline the lowest eight singlet
   electronic states. Two methods were used to analyze the Renner-Teller
   effect. The first method is an empirical Hamiltonian based on normal
   modes, using harmonic oscillator functions as a basis, with
   Renner-Teller and other terms added as required, which allows
   conventional vibrational parameters to be determined. The second is a
   much larger program that uses the exact kinetic energy operator for a
   triatomic molecule to calculate vibronic energy levels directly from
   the Renner-Teller pair of potential energy surfaces. Both methods give
   a good fit to the experimental results, with only a small adjustment to
   the ab initio surfaces required for the latter. One of the overall
   conclusions is that the Renner-Teller effect is rather smaller in the D
   (1)Delta(g) state than in the A (1)Pi(u) state.}}

Abstract = {{The vibrational structure of the (A) over bar (1)Pi(u) electronic state
   of C-3 in the region 26 000-30 775 cm(-1) has been re-examined, using
   laser excitation spectra of jet-cooled molecules. Rotational constants
   and vibrational energies have been determined for over 60
   previously-unreported vibronic levels: a number of other levels have
   been re-assigned. The vibrational structure is complicated by
   interactions between levels of the upper and lower Born-Oppenheimer
   components of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, and by the effects of
   the double minimum potential in the Q(3) coordinate, recognized by Izuha
   and Yamanouchi {[}16]. The present work shows that there is also strong
   anharmonic resonance between the overtones of the v(1) and v(3)
   vibrations. For instance, the levels 2 1(+)1 and 0 1(+)3 are nearly
   degenerate in zero order, but as a result of the resonance they give
   rise to two levels 139 cm(-1) apart, centered about the expected
   position of the 2 1(+)1 level. With these irregularities recognized,
   every observed vibrational level up to 30 000 cm(-1) (a vibrational
   energy of over 5000 cm(-1)) can now be assigned. A Sigma(+)(u) vibronic
   level at 30181.4 cm(-1), which has a much lower B' rotational constant
   than nearby levels of the (A) over tilde (1)Pi(u) state, possibly
   represents the onset of vibronic perturbations by the (B) over
   tilde'(1)Delta(u) electronic state; this state is so far unknown, but is
   predicted by the ab initio calculations of Ahmed et al. {[}36].}},

   374, 583 (2003)] in cavity ring-down spectra of jet-cooled C-3. Detailed
   analysis of these extra lines shows that at least two long-lived states
   perturb the A (1)Pi(u), 000 state. One of these appears to be a
   (3)Sigma(u)(-) vibronic state, which may possibly be a high vibrational
   level of the b (3)Pi(g) state, and the other appears to be a P=1 state
   with a low rotational constant B. Our spectra also confirm the
   reassignment by McCall of the R(0) line of the 000-000 band, which is
   consistent with the spectra recorded towards a number of stars that
   indicate the presence of C-3 in the interstellar medium. Fluorescence
   lifetimes have been measured for a number of upper-state rotational
   levels. The rotational levels of the A (1)Pi(u) state have lifetimes in
   the range of 230-190 ns, decreasing slightly with J; the levels of the
   perturbing states have much longer lifetimes, with some of them showing
   biexponential decays. An improved value has been obtained for the nu(1)
