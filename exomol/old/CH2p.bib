  abstract = {The potential energy surface and dipole moment surfaces of the (a)
	over tilde (4)A(2) electronic state of CH2+ are calculated ab initio
	using an augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple-zeta
	(aug-cc-pVQZ) basis set, with the incorporation of dynamical correlation
	using the coupled cluster method with single and double excitations
	and perturbatively connected triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)]. We use
	these surfaces in the MORBID program system to calculate rotation
	and rotation-vibration term values for (a) over tilde -state CH2+,
	CD2+, and CHD+ and to simulate the rotation and rotation-vibration
	absorption spectrum of CH2+ in the (a) over tilde (4)A(2) electronic
	state. Our work is motivated by studies of CH2+ that use the Coulomb
	explosion imaging technique and by the goal of predicting spectra
	that may be obtained from discharge sources. Although the (a) over
	tilde state is the lowest-lying excited state above the (X) over
	tilde/(A) over tilde ground state pair, it turns out to be relatively
	high-lying, and we determine that T-e((a) over tilde) = 30447.5 cm(-1).
	The equilibrium bond angle for (a) over tilde -state CH2+ is only
	77.1degrees; as a result the asymmetric top kappa value is close
	to 0, and the molecule is equally far from the oblate and prolate
	symmetric top limits in this electronic state. (C) 2002 Elsevier

  abstract = {The ground (X) over tilde(2)A(1) electronic state of CH2+ is quasilinear
	with a small barrier to linearity, and at linearity the state becomes
	degenerate with the (A) over tilde(2)B(1) electronic state forming
	a (2) Pi(u) state. Because of the nonzero electronic angular momentum
	the rovibrational basis states belonging to the two electronic states
	strongly interact due to both the Renner effect and spin-orbit coupling.
	Tn a previous paper (P. Jensen, M. Brumm, W. P. Kraemer, and P. R.
	Bunker, J. Mel. Spectrosc. 172 (1995) 194) we calculated the rovibronic
	energies of the states using ab initio potential energy surfaces
	that we generated. In the present paper we use the electronic wavefunctions
	of the previous nb initio calculation to determine the dipole moment
	and transition moment surfaces, and we develop the theory that allows
	us to use these to calculate intensities. As a result we now calculate
	both the positions and intensities of the lines in the absorption
	spectrum of CH2+, and its deuterated isotopomers, making full allowance
	for the effects of the Renner interaction and of spin-orbit coupling.
	We predict the appearance of the absorption spectrum over the whole
	wavenumber range from 0 cm(-1) to beyond 15 000 cm(-1); this involves
	only the (X) over tilde and (A) over tilde electronic states. We
	hope that these results allow experimentalists to search successfully
	for the features that we predict, and thereby to achieve a better
	spectroscopic characterization of this important molecular ion. (C)
