Abstract = {The vibrational levels for two isotopic species of methyl chloride have
   been calculated in the region 03500 cm(-1) from the ab initio potential
   energy surface (PES). The isotopic shift of vibrational levels of
   molecules (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-35 and (CH3Cl)-C-12-Cl-37 has been calculated.
   The correlation consistent basis sets cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ are employed
   to calculate energy values for 7957 and 3758 points correspondingly from
   a large domain of the nine-dimensional internal coordinate space. The
   analytic global PES is fitted with the standard deviation of 4.5 cm(-1).
