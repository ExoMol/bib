Title = {{Empirical line intensities of methanol in the 300-500 cm(-1) region}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {128-139},
Abstract = {{Given the expectations associated with modern observational facilities
   such as Herschel, ALMA and SOFIA, and the ubiquity of methanol in
   interstellar gas, precise knowledge of the methanol spectrum is
   critical. Abundant research has characterized the line positions and
   quantum assignments in the far infrared, but there is a dearth of line
   intensity information at most wavelengths. In this work, an empirical
   database of methanol line intensities from 300 to 500 cm(-1) has been
   compiled from far-infrared measurements recorded on the Bruker IFS 125
   HR Fourier transform spectrometer located at the Jet Propulsion
   Laboratory. The sum of the integrated line intensities has been computed
   (Sigma(Int) = 1.13 x 10(-18) cm(-1)/(molecule cm(-2))) at 296 K for 1317
   measured features. These have been combined with known assignments for
   2v(12)-gs, v(12)-gs, 2v(12)-v(12) plus a few other bands with a small
   number of transitions in the spectral range of this study. Line
   intensities of 916 unblended features have been compared to available
   theoretical calculations of Mekhtiev et al., J. Mol. Spectrosc., 194,
   171-178 (1999). These results support the analysis of astronomical
   observations taken from orbit by the Herschel HIFI instrument. (C) 2011

Title = {{Torsion-rotation global analysis of the first three torsional states
   (nu(t)=0, 1, 2) and terahertz database for methanol}},
Journal = JMS,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{251}},
Pages = {305-313},
Abstract = {{Stimulated by recent THz measurements of the methanol spectrum in one of
   our laboratories, undertaken in support of NASA programs related to the
   Herschel Space Observatory (HSO) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
   (ALMA), we have carried Out a global analysis of available microwave and
   high-resolution infrared data for the first three torsional states
   (nu(t) = 0, 1, 2), and for J values up to 30. This global fit of
   approximately 5600 frequency measurements and 19000 Fourier transform
   far infrared (FTFIR) wavenumber measurements to 119 parameters reaches
   the estimated experimental measurement accuracy for the FTFIR
   transitions, and about twice the estimated experimental measurement
   accuracy for the microwave, submillimeter-wave, and terahertz
   transitions. The present fit is essentially a continuation Of Our
   earlier work, but we have greatly expanded our previous data set and
   have added a large number of new torsion-rotation interaction terms to
   the Hamiltonian in Our previously used Computer program. The results,
   together with a number of calculated (but unmeasured) transitions,
   including their line strength, estimated uncertainty, and lower state
   energy, are made available in the supplementary material as a database
   formatted to be useful for astronomical searches. Some discussion of
   several open spectroscopic problems, e.g., (i) an improved notation for
   the numerous parameters in the torsion-rotation Hamiltonian, (ii)
   possible causes of the failure to fit frequency measurements to the
   estimated measurement uncertainty, and (iii) pitfalls to be avoided when
   intercomparing apparently identical parameters from the internal axis
   method and the rho axis method are also given.}},
