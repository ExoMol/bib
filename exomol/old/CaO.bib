	limit for the 2S+ lowest states of the latter systems consists of
	the positive metal ion ground state (M+) and the OPs complex (e+O-),
	although the lowest energy limit is thought to be e+M + O. Good agreement

	of the closed-shell X 1S+ ground states of both systems is found
	to lie in the 0.160.19 eV range, less than half the corresponding
	values for the lighter members of the alkaline earth monoxide series,
	BeO and MgO. Annihilation rates (ARs) have been calculated for all
	four positronated systems for the first time. The variation with
	bond distance is generally similar to what has been found earlier
	for the alkali monoxide series of positronic complexes, falling off
	gradually from the OPs AR value at their respective dissociation
	limits. The e+SrO system shows some exceptional behavior, however,

	The A'(1)Pi-X'Sigma(+) chemiluminescence was excited in a Ca + N2O
	flame produced in a Broida-type oven. More than 3000 rotational lines,
	classified into 19 bands involving the A'1 Pi 0 less than or equal
	to nu' less than or equal to 3 and the X(1)Sigma(+) 1 less than or
	equal to nu{''} less than or equal to 7 vibrational levels were measured
	in the 4000-10 000 cm(-1) region with a precision of 0.005 cm(-1).
	The X(1)Sigma(+) (nu = 0, 1) millimeter-wave and X(1)Sigma(+) (v
	= 0-3) infrared data available in the literature were merged with
	our new electronic data in order to obtain improved Dunham constants
	for the ground state of CaO. Very peculiar perturbations are observed
	in the higher vibrational levels of the A'(1)Pi state, so the upper
	levels of transitions with nu' = 2 and 3 were represented by term
	values in our least-squares analysis. The interaction of the A'(1)Pi
	(nu greater than or equal to 2) levels with the nearby b(3)Sigma(+)
	(nu-2) levels has been detected. An extended set of A'(1)Pi (nu =
	0-3) data has been obtained which is suitable for use in a future
	multistate departurbation analysis of the a(3)Pi similar to A'(1)Pi
	similar to b(3)Sigma(+) similar to A(1)Sigma(+) complex of excited
	states. The new near-infrared spectra of the A'(1)Pi-X-1 Sigma(+)

	between the orange and green systems and the near-infrared bands.

Title = {{Constraints on the exosphere of CoRoT-7b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{525}},
Abstract = {{Context. The small radius and high density of CoRoT-7b implies that this
   transiting planet belongs to a different species than all transiting
   planets previously found. Current models suggest that this is the first
   transiting rocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the
   planet orbits a solar-like star at a distance of only 4.5 R-{*}, it is
   expected that material released from its surface may then form an
   exosphere.
   Aims. We constrain the properties of the exosphere by observing the
   planet in-and out-of-transit. Detecting the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would
   for the first time allow us to study the material originating in the
   surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan the entire optical
   spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing
   particularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury and Io
   in our solar system.
   Methods. Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to be
   narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By
   subtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and
   absorption lines originating in the exosphere of CoRoT-7b.
   Results. In the first step, we focus on Ca I, Ca II, and Na, because
   these lines have been detected in Mercury. Since the signal-to-noise
   ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as 300, we derive firm upper
   limits for the flux-range between 1.6 x 10(-18) and 3.2 x 10(-18) W
   m(-2). For CaO, we find an upper limit of 10(-17) W m(-2). We also
   search for emission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by
   volcanic activity and derive upper limits for these lines. In the whole
   spectrum we finally try to identify other lines originating in the
   planet.
   Conclusions. Except for CaO, the upper limits derived correspond to 2-6
   x 10(-6) L-{*}, demonstrating the capability of UVES to detect very weak
   lines. Our observations certainly exclude the extreme interpretations of
   data for CoRoT-7b, such as an exosphere that emits 2000 times as
   brightly as Mercury.}},

Journal = MP,
Year = {2003},
Volume = {101},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1345-1361},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Core-valence basis sets for the alkali and alkaline earth metals Li, Be,
   Na, Mg, K, and Ca are proposed. The basis sets are validated by
   calculating spectroscopic constants of a variety of diatomic molecules
   involving these elements. Neglect of (3s, 3p) correlation in K and Ca
   compounds will lead to erratic results at best, and chemically
   nonsensical ones if chalcogens or halogens are present. The addition of
   low-exponent p functions to the K and Ca basis sets is essential for the
   smooth convergence of molecular properties. Inclusion of inner-shell
   correlation is important for accurate spectroscopic constants and
   binding energies of all the compounds. In basis set
   extrapolation/convergence calculations, the explicit inclusion of alkali
   and alkaline earth metal subvalence correlation at all steps is
   essential for K and Ca, strongly recommended for Na, and optional for Li
   and Mg, while in Be compounds an additive treatment in a separate `core
   correlation' step is probably sufficient. Consideration of (1s)
   inner-shell correlation energy in first-row elements requires the
   inclusion of (2s, 2p) `deep core' correlation energy in K and Ca for
   consistency. The latter requires special CCVnZ `deep core correlation'
   basis sets. For compounds involving Ca bound to electronegative
   elements, additional d functions in the basis set are strongly
   recommended. For optimal basis set convergence in such cases, we suggest
   the sequence CV(D + 3d)Z, CV(T + 2d)Z, CV(Q + d)Z, and CV5Z on calcium.},
