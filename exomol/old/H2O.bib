Title = {{Systematic trend of water vapour absorption in red giant atmospheres
   revealed by high resolution TEXES 12 mu m spectra}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{573}},
Abstract = {{Context. The structures of the outer atmospheres of red giants are very
   complex. Recent interpretations of a range of different observations
   have led to contradictory views of these regions. It is clear, however,
   that classical model photospheres are inadequate to describe the nature
   of the outer atmospheres. The notion of large optically thick molecular
   spheres around the stars (MOLspheres) has been invoked in order to
   explain spectro-interferometric observations and low-and high-resolution
   spectra. On the other hand high-resolution spectra in the mid-IR do not
   easily fit into this picture because they rule out any large sphere of
   water vapour in LTE surrounding red giants.
   Aims. In order to approach a unified scenario for these outer regions of
   red giants, more empirical evidence from different diagnostics are
   needed. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-IR spectra
   for a range of red giants, spanning spectral types from early K to mid
   M. We want to study how the pure rotational lines of water vapour change
   with effective temperature, and whether we can find common properties
   that can put new constraints on the modelling of these regions, so that
   we can gain new insights.
   Methods. We have recorded mid-IR spectra at 12.2-12.4 mu m at high
   spectral resolution of ten well-studied bright red giants, with TEXES
   mounted on the IRTF on Mauna Kea. These stars span effective
   temperatures from 3450 K to 4850 K.
   Results. We find that all red giants in our study cooler than 4300 K,
   spanning a wide range of effective temperatures (down to 3450 K), show
   water absorption lines stronger than expected and none are detected in
   emission, in line with what has been previously observed for a few
   stars. The strengths of the lines vary smoothly with spectral type. We
   identify several spectral features in the wavelength region that are
   undoubtedly formed in the photosphere. From a study of water-line ratios
   of the stars, we find that the excitation temperatures, in the
   line-forming regions, are several hundred Kelvin lower than expected
   from a classical photospheric model.
   Conclusions. All stars in our sample show several photospheric features
   in their 12 mu m spectra, which can be modelled with a classical model
   photosphere. However, in all stars showing water-vapour lines (stars
   cooler than similar to 4300 K), the water lines are found to be much
   deeper than expected. The line ratios of these pure-rotational lines
   reveal low excitation temperatures. This could either be due to lower
   temperatures than expected in the outer regions of the photospheres
   caused by for example extra cooling, or due to non-LTE level
   populations, affecting the source function and line opacities, but this
   needs further investigation. We have demonstrated that these
   diagnostically interesting water lines are a general feature of red
   giants across spectral types, and we argue for a general explanation of
   their formation rather than explanations requiring specific properties,
   such as dust. Since the water lines are neither weak (filled in by
   emission) nor do they appear in emission, as predicted by LTE MOLsphere
   models in their simplest forms, the evidence of the existence of such
   large optically-thick, molecular spheres enshrouding the stars is
   weakened. It is still a challenge to find a unifying picture of the
   outer regions of the atmospheres of red giants, but we have presented
   new empirical evidence that needs to be taken into account and explained
   in any model of these regions.}},

   giant branch star IRC+10216 (a.k.a. CW Leonis) using the HIFI instrument
   on the Herschel Space Observatory. This search was motivated by the fact
   that any detection of isotopic enhancement in the (H2O)-O-17 and
   (H2O)-O-18 abundances would have strongly implicated CO
   photodissociation as the source of the atomic oxygen needed to produce
   water in a carbon-rich circumstellar envelope. Our observations place an
   upper limit of 1/470 on the (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-16 abundance ratio.
   Given the isotopic O-17/O-16 ratio of 1/840 inferred previously for the
   photosphere of IRC+10216, this result places an upper limit of a factor
   1.8 on the extent of any isotope-selective enhancement of (H2O)-O-17 in
   the circumstellar material, and provides an important constraint on any
   model that invokes CO photodissociation as the source of O for H2O
   production. In the context of the clumpy photodissociation model
   proposed previously for the origin of water in IRC+10216, our limit
   implies that (CO)-C-12-O-16 ( not (CO)-C-13-O-16 or SiO) must be the
   dominant source of O-16 for H2O production, and that the effects of
   self-shielding can only have reduced the (CO)-C-12-O-16
   photodissociation rate by at most a factor similar to 2.}},

Abstract = {{We review current observational and theoretical constraints on the
   galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of oxygen isotopes to explore whether
   GCE plays a role in explaining the lower 17O/18O ratio of the Sun,
   relative to the present-day interstellar medium, or the existence of
   distinct 16O-rich and 16O-poor reservoirs in the solar system. Although
   the production of both 17O and 18O are related to the metallicity of
   progenitor stars, 17O is most likely produced in stars that evolve on
   longer timescales than those that produce 18O. Therefore, the 17O/18O
   ratio need not have remained constant over time, contrary to
   preconceptions and the simplest models of GCE. An apparent linear,
   slope-one correlation between delta 17O and delta 18O in the ISM need
   not necessarily reflect an O isotopic gradient, and any slope-one
   galactocentric gradient need not correspond to evolution in time.
   Instead, increasing 17O/18O is consistent both with observational data
   from molecular clouds and with modeling of the compositions of presolar
   grains. Models in which the rate of star formation has decelerated over
   the past few Gyr or in which an enhanced period of star formation
   occurred shortly before solar birth (starburst) can explain the
   solar-ISM O-isotopic difference without requiring a local input of
   supernova ejecta into the protosolar cloud. Cosmic chemical memory
   models in which interstellar dust is on average older than interstellar
   gas predict that primordial solar system solids should be 16O-rich,
   relative to the Sun, in conflict with observations. However, scenarios
   can be constructed in which the 16O-rich contribution of very massive
   stars could lead to 16O-poor solids and a 16O-rich bulk Sun, if the
   solar system formed shortly after a starburst, independent of the
   popular scenario of photochemical self-shielding of CO.}},

Abstract = {{An IDP nicknamed Andric, from a stratospheric dust collector targeted to
   collect dust from comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, contains five distinct
   presolar silicate and/or oxide grains in 14 ultramicrotome slices
   analyzed, for an estimated abundance of approximately 700 ppm in this
   IDP. Three of the grains are 17O-enriched and probably formed in
   low-mass red giant or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars; the other two
   grains exhibit 18O enrichments and may have a supernova origin. Carbon
   and N isotopic analyses show that Andric also exhibits significant
   variations in its N isotopic composition, with numerous discrete
   15N-rich hotspots and more diffuse regions that are also isotopically
   anomalous. Three 15N-rich hotspots also have statistically significant
   13C enrichments. Auger elemental analysis shows that these isotopically
   anomalous areas consist largely of carbonaceous matter and that the
   anomalies may be hosted by a variety of components. In addition, there
   is evidence for dilution of the isotopically heavy components with an
   isotopically normal endmember; this may have occurred either as a result
   of extraterrestrial alteration or during atmospheric entry. Isotopically
   primitive IDPs such as Andric share many characteristics with primitive
   meteorites such as the CR chondrites, which also contain isotopically
   anomalous carbonaceous matter and abundant presolar silicate and oxide
   grains. Although comets are one likely source for the origin of
   primitive IDPs, the presence of similar characteristics in meteorites
   thought to come from the asteroid belt suggests that other origins are
   also possible. Indeed the distinction between cometary and asteroidal
   sources is somewhat blurred by recent observations of icy comet-like
   planetesimals in the outer asteroid belt.}},

Journal = {Meteorics Planet. Sci.},

Pages = {1998-2012},
Abstract = {{The composition of the most primitive solar system condensates, such as
   calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) and micron-sized corundum
   grains, show that short-lived radionuclides (SLR), e.g., 26Al, were
   present in the early solar system. Their abundances require a local or
   stellar origin, which, however, is far from being understood. We present
   for the first time the abundances of several SLR up to 60Fe predicted
   from stars with initial mass in the range approximately 711 M circle
   dot. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning. After core C
   burning they go through a Super-asymptotic giant branch (Super-AGB)
   phase, with the H and He shells activated alternately, episodic thermal
   pulses in the He shell, a very hot temperature at the base of the
   convective envelope (approximately 108 K), and strong stellar winds
   driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding interstellar medium.
   The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB stars are mostly ONe
   white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce 26Al/27Al yield ratios
   approximately 0.020.26. These models can account for the canonical value
   of the 26Al/27Al ratio using dilutions with the solar nebula of the
   order of 1 part of Super-AGB mass per several 102 to several 103 of
   solar nebula mass, resulting in associated changes in the O-isotope
   composition in the range Delta 17O from 3 to 20 parts per thousand. This
   is in agreement with observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive
   solar system condensates, which do not carry the signature of a stellar
   polluter. The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron
   captures in Super-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also
   matched by some of our models, depending on the nuclear and stellar
   physics uncertainties as well as the meteoritic experimental data. We
   also expect and are currently investigating Super-AGB production of SLR
   heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured the silicon isotopic compositions of 38 presolar
   silicate grains from the carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 094, which have
   been previously studied for oxygen isotopes. The goals of this study are
   to further disentangle stellar sources of the O-18-enriched (Group IV)
   and the most O-17-enriched (Group I) silicate grains and to put further
   constraints on the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of the Si isotopes.
   Our results show that the majority (6 out of 8) of the O-18 enriched
   silicates have enhanced Si-28, in qualitative agreement with the
   signature of presolar silicon carbide (SiC) X grains from supernovae.
   Three highly 17O-enriched grains (O-17/O-16 > 3 x 10(-3)) have close to
   solar Si-29/Si-28 but enhanced Si-30/Si-28, possibly indicating an
   origin in binary systems. Alternative stellar sources are 3.5-4 M-circle
   dot asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Si isotopic compositions of the
   majority of presolar silicates fall along the SiC mainstream line,
   although most grains plot to the Si-30-poor side of this line. Most
   presolar silicate grains therefore formed in red giant branch (RGB)/AGB
   stars of roughly solar metallicity, and incorporated less (or no) Si
   processed by slow neutron capture reactions ({''}s-process{''}) than
   presolar SiC grains, because silicates form before large amounts of C-12
   and s-processed material has been dredged up to the surface. The
   inferred shift of the Si isotopes due to the different dredge-up of
   matter from the He intershell in C-rich AGB stars is Delta Si-29 = 3
   parts per thousand-2 parts per thousand and Delta Si-30 = 17 parts per
   thousand-30 parts per thousand, which is compatible with predictions for
   1.5-3 M-circle dot AGB stars of solar metallicity when C/O > 1.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analysis of the far-infrared and submillimetre molecular
   emission-line spectrum of the luminous M-supergiant VY CMa, observed
   with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and
   Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer for Herschel spectrometers
   aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Over 260 emission lines were
   detected in the 190-650 mu m SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer
   spectra, with one-third of the observed lines being attributable to H2O.
   Other detected species include CO, (CO)-C-13, (H2O)-O-18, SiO, HCN, SO,
   SO2, CS, H2S and NH3. Our model fits to the observed (CO)-C-12 and
   (CO)-C-13 line intensities yield a C-12/C-13 ratio of 5.6 +/- 1.8,
   consistent with measurements of this ratio for other M-supergiants, but
   significantly lower than previously estimated for VY CMa from
   observations of lower-J lines. The spectral line energy distribution for
   20 SiO rotational lines shows two temperature components: a hot
   component at similar to 1000 K, which we attribute to the stellar
   atmosphere and inner wind, plus a cooler similar to 200 K component,
   which we attribute to an origin in the outer circumstellar envelope. We
   fit the line fluxes of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, H2O and SiO, using the
   SMMOL non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) line transfer code, with
   a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1) between 9R({*})

   (CO)-C-13, H2O and SiO with SMMOL non-LTE line radiative transfer code,
   along with a mass-loss rate of 1.85 x 10(-4) M-circle dot yr(-1). To fit
   the high rotational lines of CO and H2O, the model required a rather
   flat temperature distribution inside the dust condensation radius,
   attributed to the high H2O opacity. Beyond the dust condensation radius
   the gas temperature is fitted best by an r(-0.5) radial dependence,
   consistent with the coolant lines becoming optically thin. Our H2O
   emission-line fits are consistent with an ortho: para ratio of 3 in the

Journal = AA,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{548}},
Abstract = {{Context. We re-analyzed the carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the
   atmospheres of the two bright K giants Arcturus (a Boo) and Aldebaran (a
   Tau).
   Aims. These stars are in the evolutionary stage following the first
   dredge-up (FDU). Previous determinations (dating back more than 20
   years) of their O-16/O-18 ratios showed a rough agreement with FDU
   expectations; however, the estimated O-16/O-17 and C-12/C-13 ratios were
   lower than in the canonical predictions for red giants. Today these
   anomalies are interpreted as signs of the occurrence of non-convective
   mixing episodes. We therefore re-investigated this problem to verify
   whether the observed data can be reproduced in this scenario and if the
   fairly well determined properties of the two stars can help us in fixing
   the uncertain parameters that characterize non-convective mixing and in
   constraining its physical nature.
   Methods. We used high-resolution infrared spectra from the literature to
   derive the C-12/C-13 and O-16/O-17/O-18 ratios from CO molecular lines
   near 5 mu m, using the local termodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectral
   synthesis method. We made use of the recently published ACE-FTS atlas of
   the infrared solar spectrum for constructing an updated atomic and
   molecular line lists in this spectral range. We also reconsidered the
   determination of the stellar parameters to build the proper atmospheric
   and evolutionary models.
   Results. We found that both the C and the O isotopic ratios for the two
   stars considered actually disagree with pure FDU predictions. This
   reinforces the idea that non-convective transport episodes occurred in
   these stars. By reproducing the observed elemental and isotopic
   abundances with the help of parametric models for the coupled occurrence
   of nucleosynthesis and mass circulation, we derived constraints on the
   properties of non-convective mixing, providing information on the so far
   elusive physics of these phenomena. We find that very slow mixing, like
   that associated to diffusive processes, is incapable of explaining the
   observed data, which require a fast transport. Circulation mechanisms
   with speeds intermediate between those typical of diffusive and
   convective mixing are necessary. We conclude with a word of caution on
   the conclusions possible at this stage however, as the parameters for
   the mass transport are fairly sensitive to the stellar mass and initial
   composition. At least for a Boo, reducing the uncertainty still
   remaining on these data would be highly desirable.}},

   constrains the branching ratio in the dissociative recombination of H3O+
   to form water. We find at the 3 sigma level that no more than 30\% of
   dissociative recombinations of H3O+ can lead to H2O. The observed
   spectrum also yielded high-resolution observations of the Mg II doublet
   at 1239.9 Angstrom and 1240.4 Angstrom, allowing the velocity structure

To this end, spectral transmissivities at 1&#xa0;cm−1 resolution and excellent signal-to-noise-ratio have been measured for twenty two \{CO\} 2 / H 2 O / N 2 mixtures. In this paper we consider the 450&#xa0;cm−1 - 7600&#xa0;cm−1 spectral range. The LbL calculations and their comparison with the measured spectra have clearly shown that HITEMP-2010 is an excellent data base (superior to previous versions) for calculating emissivities and absorption coefficients for \{CO2\} and H 2 O molecules in the 500&#xa0;K–1770&#xa0;K range. Several absorption lines listed in HITEMP-2010 have not been observed in the measured spectra and/or are wrongly scaled with temperature. The complete (there are no missing bands) spectra spanning the 450 cm − 1 – 7600 cm − 1 range are appended as Supplementary Material. "
