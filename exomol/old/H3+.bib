Abstract = {{Using an absorption line from the metastable (J; K) ( 3; 3) level of
   H-3(+) together with other lines of H-3(+) and CO observed along several
   sight lines, we have discovered a vast amount of high-temperature (T
   similar to 250 K) and low-density (n similar to 100 cm(-3)) gas with a
   large velocity dispersion in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the
   Galaxy, i. e., within 200 pc of the center. Approximately three-fourths
   of the H-3(+) along the line of sight to the brightest source we
   observed, the Quintuplet object GCS 3-2, is inferred to be in the CMZ,
   with the remaining H-3(+) located in intervening spiral arms. About half
   of the H-3(+) in the CMZ has velocities near similar to -100 km s(-1),
   indicating that it is associated with the 180 pc radius expanding
   molecular ring, which approximately forms the outer boundary of the CMZ.
   The other half, with velocities of similar to -50 and similar to 0 km
   s(-1), is probably closer to the center. CO is not very abundant in
   these clouds. Hot and diffuse gas in which the (3, 3) level is populated
   was not detected toward several dense clouds and diffuse clouds in the
   Galactic disk where large column densities of colder H-3(+) have been
   reported previously. Thus, the newly discovered environment appears to
   be unique to the CMZ. The large observed H-3(+) column densities in the
   CMZ suggest an ionization rate much higher than in the diffuse
   interstellar medium in the Galactic disk. Our finding that the H-3(+) in
   the CMZ is almost entirely in diffuse clouds indicates that the reported
   volume filling factor (f >= 0.1) for n >= 10(4) cm(-3) clouds in the CMZ
   is an overestimate by at least an order of magnitude.}},

	abstract = "Multichannel atomic spectra frequently exhibit such extraordinary visual complexity that they appear at first glance to be uninterpretable. The present review discusses how to unravel such spectra through the use of theoretical multichannel spectroscopy to extract the key dynamical implications. Moreover, this class of techniques permits a quantitative prediction or reproduction of experimental spectra for some of the more challenging atomic systems under investigation. It is shown that multichannel spectroscopy marries the techniques of multichannel quantum-defect theory to the eigenchannel R-matrix method (or related methods). It has long been appreciated that multichannel quantum-defect theory can successfully use a collision-theory framework to interpret enormously complicated Rydberg spectra. However, the capabilities of multichannel quantum-defect theory have increased dramatically during the past decade, through the development of nearly ab initio methods for the calculation of the short-range scattering parameters that control the interactions of closed and open channels. In this review, emphasis is given to the alkaline-earth atoms, for which many different observables have been successfully compared with experiment over broad ranges of energy and resolution. Applications of the method to describe the photoionization spectra of more complex open-shell atoms are also discussed."

At the same time, it is the simplest triatomic ion and for this reason its theoretical description can serve as a prototype for other polyatomic ions. Meanwhile, experimental determinations of the recombination rate have varied widely, which has resulted in some controversy and confusion. Until recently, it seemed unlikely that this problem could be resolved by theoretical studies because the mechanism of H-3(+) dissociative recombination remained unclear. A recent study, however [Kokoouline , Nature (London) 412, 891 (2001)], provided evidence that the inclusion of the Jahn-Teller coupling can produce a dissociative recombination rate that overlaps the range of experimental observations. Here, we propose a theoretical description of the coupling between nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in a polyatomic molecule, which describes the competition between autoionization and predissociation of the Rydberg states formed after an incident electron is captured. The method treats the vibrational and rotational excitations of the ion, accounts for all symmetry restrictions imposed by the geometry of the molecule, including vibrational, rotational, and electronic and nuclear-spin symmetries. The framework combines the multichannel quantum-defect theory, the adiabatic hyperspherical approach, and the techniques of outgoing-wave Siegert pseudostates. The proposed method can be applied to studies of dissociative recombination of other triatomic ions, including all the degrees of freedom quantum mechanically. Our calculations of the cross section and the recombination rate confirm that the Jahn-Teller effect is responsible for the large rate in H-3(+). Theoretical results for dissociative recombination of H-3(+) are in agreement with storage-ring experiments."

   INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM THROUGH OBSERVATIONS OF H-3(+)}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{745}},
Abstract = {{Observations of H-3(+) in the Galactic diffuse interstellar medium have
   led to various surprising results, including the conclusion that the
   cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta(2)) is about one order of magnitude
   larger than previously thought. The present survey expands the sample of
   diffuse cloud sight lines with H-3(+) observations to 50, with
   detections in 21 of those. Ionization rates inferred from these
   observations are in the range (1.7 +/- 1.3) x 10(-16) s(-1) < zeta(2) <
   (10.6 +/- 8.2) x 10(-16) s(-1) with a mean value of zeta(2) =
   (3.5(-3.0)(+5.3)) x 10(-16) s(-1). Upper limits (3 sigma) derived from
   non-detections of H-3(+) are as low as.2 < 0.4 x 10-16 s-1. These low
   upper limits, in combination with the wide range of inferred cosmic-ray
   ionization rates, indicate variations in zeta(2) between different
   diffuse cloud sight lines. A study of zeta(2) versus N-H (total hydrogen
   column density) shows that the two parameters are not correlated for
   diffuse molecular cloud sight lines, but that the ionization rate
   decreases when NH increases to values typical of dense molecular clouds.
   Both the difference in ionization rates between diffuse and dense clouds
   and the variation of zeta(2) among diffuse cloud sight lines are likely
   the result of particle propagation effects. The lower ionization rate in
   dense clouds is due to the inability of low-energy (few MeV) protons to
   penetrate such regions, while the ionization rate in diffuse clouds is
   controlled by the proximity of the observed cloud to a site of particle
   acceleration.}},

   EIGHT INFRARED SOURCES WITHIN 30 pc OF THE GALACTIC CENTER}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{688}},
Pages = {306-319},
Abstract = {{Infrared absorption lines of H-3(+), including the metastable R(3, 3)(l)
   line, have been observed toward eight bright infrared sources associated
   with hot and massive stars located in and between the Galactic center
   cluster and the Quintuplet cluster 30 pc to the east. The absorption
   lines with high-velocity dispersion arise in the Galaxy's central
   molecular zone (CMZ) as well as in foreground spiral arms. The
   temperature and density of the gas in the CMZ, as determined from the
   relative strengths of the H-3(+) lines, are T 200-300 K and n <= 50-200
   cm(-3). The detection of high column densities of H-3(+) toward all
   eight stars implies that this warm and diffuse gaseous environment is
   widespread in the CMZ. The products of the ionization rate and path
   length for these sight lines are 1000 and 10 times higher than in dense
   and diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk, respectively, indicating that
   the ionization rate, zeta, is not less than 10(-15) s(-1) and that L is
   at least on the order of 50 pc. The warm and diffuse gas is an important
   component of the CMZ, in addition to the three previously known gaseous
   environments: ( 1) cold molecular clouds observed by radio emission of
   CO and other molecules; (2) hot (T = 10(4)-10(6) K) and highly ionized
   diffuse gas (n(e) = 10-100 cm(-3)) seen in radio recombination lines,
   far infrared atomic lines, and radio-wave scattering; and (3) ultrahot
   (T = 10(7)-10(8) K) X-ray emitting plasma. Its prevalence significantly
   changes the understanding of the environment of the CMZ. The sight line
   toward GC IRS 3 is unique in showing an additional H-3(+) absorption
   component, which is interpreted as being due to either a cloud
   associated with circumnuclear disk or the ``50 km s(-1) cloud'' known
   from radio observations. An infrared pumping scheme is examined as a
   mechanism to populate the (3,3) metastable level in this cloud.}},

   GCS 3-2 and GC IRS3}},

Pages = {951-961},
Abstract = {{We present high-resolution (R = 20000) spectroscopy of H-3(+) absorption
   toward the luminous Galactic center sources GCS 3-2 and GC IRS 3. With
   the efficient wavelength coverage afforded by Subaru IRCS, six
   absorption lines of H-3(+) have been detected in each source from 3.5 to
   4.0 mum, three of which are new. In particular the 3.543 mum absorption
   line of the R(3, 3)(l) transition arising from the metastable (J, K) =
   (3, 3) state has been tentatively detected for the first time in the
   interstellar medium, where previous observations of H-3(+) had been
   limited to absorption lines from the lowest levels: (J, K) = (1, 0) of
   ortho-H-3(+) and (1, 1) of para-H-3(+).
   The H-3(+) absorption toward the Galactic center takes place in dense
   and diffuse clouds along the line of sight as well as the molecular
   complex close to the Galactic nucleus. At least four kinematic
   components are found in the H-3(+) absorption lines. We suggest
   identifications of the velocity components with those of H I, CO, and
   H2CO previously reported from radio and infrared observations. H I
   components with velocities that match those of weak and sharp CO and
   H2CO lines are attributed to diffuse clouds. Our observation has
   revealed a striking difference between the absorption profiles of H-3(+)
   and CO, demonstrating that the spectroscopy of H-3(+) provides
   information complementary to that obtained from CO spectroscopy.
   The tentative detection of the R(3, 3)(l) line and the non-detection of
   spectral lines from other J > 1 levels provide observational evidence
   for the metastability of the (3, 3) level, which is theoretically
   expected. This suggests that other metastable J = K levels with higher J
   may also be populated.}}}

   H-3(+)1,2,3}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{632}},
Pages = {882-893},
Abstract = {{Using an absorption line from the metastable (J; K) ( 3; 3) level of
   H-3(+) together with other lines of H-3(+) and CO observed along several
   sight lines, we have discovered a vast amount of high-temperature (T
   similar to 250 K) and low-density (n similar to 100 cm(-3)) gas with a
   large velocity dispersion in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of the
   Galaxy, i. e., within 200 pc of the center. Approximately three-fourths
   of the H-3(+) along the line of sight to the brightest source we
   observed, the Quintuplet object GCS 3-2, is inferred to be in the CMZ,
   with the remaining H-3(+) located in intervening spiral arms. About half
   of the H-3(+) in the CMZ has velocities near similar to -100 km s(-1),
   indicating that it is associated with the 180 pc radius expanding
   molecular ring, which approximately forms the outer boundary of the CMZ.
   The other half, with velocities of similar to -50 and similar to 0 km
   s(-1), is probably closer to the center. CO is not very abundant in
   these clouds. Hot and diffuse gas in which the (3, 3) level is populated
   was not detected toward several dense clouds and diffuse clouds in the
   Galactic disk where large column densities of colder H-3(+) have been
   reported previously. Thus, the newly discovered environment appears to
   be unique to the CMZ. The large observed H-3(+) column densities in the
   CMZ suggest an ionization rate much higher than in the diffuse
   interstellar medium in the Galactic disk. Our finding that the H-3(+) in
   the CMZ is almost entirely in diffuse clouds indicates that the reported
   volume filling factor (f >= 0.1) for n >= 10(4) cm(-3) clouds in the CMZ
   is an overestimate by at least an order of magnitude.}},

Pages = {3107-3112},
Abstract = {{Simulations of the thermal and dynamical evolution of primordial gas
   typically focus on the role played by H-2 cooling. H-2 is the dominant
   coolant in low-density primordial gas and it is usually assumed that it
   remains dominant at high densities. However, H-2 is not an effective
   coolant at high densities, owing to the low critical density at which it
   reaches local thermodynamic equilibrium and to the large opacities that
   develop in its emission lines. It is therefore important to quantify the
   contribution made to the cooling rate by emission from the other
   molecules and ions present in the gas. A particularly interesting
   candidate is the H-3(+) ion, which is known to be an effective coolant
   at high densities in planetary atmospheres. In this paper, we present
   results from simulations of the thermal and chemical evolution of
   gravitationally collapsing primordial gas, which include a detailed
   treatment of H-3(+) chemistry and an approximate treatment of H-3(+)
   cooling. We show that in most cases, the contribution from H-3(+) is too
   small to be important, but if a sufficiently strong ionizing background
   is present, then H-3(+) cooling may become significant.}},
