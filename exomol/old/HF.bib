Abstract = {We present measurements of the fluorine abundance in a Galactic bulge
   asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The measurements were performed
   using high-resolution K-band spectra obtained with the CRIRES
   spectrograph, which has been recently installed at ESO's VLT, together
   with state-of-the-art model atmospheres and synthetic spectra. This
   represents the first fluorine abundance measurement in a Galactic bulge
   star, and one of few measurements of this kind in a third dredge-up
   oxygen-rich AGB star. The F abundance is found to be close to the solar
   value scaled down to the metallicity of the star, and in agreement with
   disk giants that are comparable to the bulge giant studied here. The
   measurement is of astrophysical interest also because the star's mass
   can be estimated rather accurately (1.4 less than or similar to
   M/M-circle dot less than or similar to 2.0). AGB nucleosynthesis models
   predict only a very mild enrichment of F in such low mass AGB stars.
   Thus, we suggest that the fluorine abundance found in the studied star
   is representative for the star's natal cloud, and that fluorine must
   have been produced at a similar level in the bulge and in the disk.},
