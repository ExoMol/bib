Abstract = {The HSOH, H2SO and H2OS isomers have been investigated employing the
   CCSD(T) methodology and the cc-pV(X + d)Z X = 3,4,5,6 basis sets. The
   anharmonic force fields have been calculated to predict the fundamental
   vibrational frequencies, rotational constants, vibration-rotation
   corrections, anharmonic corrections to zero-point energies, and
   structural parameters. In addition to this, a spectroscopic
   characterization of the deuterated isomers D2SO and D2OS was performed.
   At the CCSD(T)/CBS limit and including corrections for scalar
   relativistic, spin orbit and core-valence correlation effects, the
   estimated enthalpies of formation are -28.1 1, -12.3 1, and 10.1 1
   kcal/mol for HSOH, H2SO and H2OS, respectively. Finally, we discuss the
   problems faced during the extrapolation to the CBS limit of the
   properties investigated.},

   detection of HSOH},

Abstract = {Sulfenic acid (HSOH, 1) has been synthesized in the gas-phase by
   low-pressure high-temperature (1150 degrees C) pyrolysis of
   di-tert-butyl sulfoxide (tBu(2)SO, 2) and characterized by means of
   matrix isolation and gasphase IR spectroscopy. High-level
   coupled-cluster (CC) calculations (CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ and CCSD(T)/ccpVQZ)
   support the first identification of the gas-phase IR spectrum of 1 and
   enable its spectral characterization. Five of the six vibrational
   fundamentals of matrix-isolated 1 have been assigned, and its rotation
   al-resolved gasphase IR spectrum provides additional information on the
   O-H and S-H stretching fundamentals. Investigations of the pyrolysis
   reaction by mass spectrometry, matrix isolation, and gasphase FT-IR
   spectroscopy reveal that, up to 500 degrees C, 2 decomposes selectively
   into tert-butylsulfenic acid, (tBuSOH, 3), and 2-methylpropene. The
   formation of the isomeric sulfoxide (tBu(H)SO, 3a) has been excluded.
   Transient 3 has been characterized by a comprehensive matrix and
   gas-phase vibrational IR study guided by the predicted vibrational
   spectrum calculated at the density functional theory (DFT) level
   (B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)). At higher temperatures, the intramolecular
   decomposition of 3, monitored by matrix IR spectroscopy, yields
   short-lived I along with 2-methylpropene, but also H2O, and most
   probably sulfur atoms. In addition, HSSOH (6), H-2, and S2O are found
   among the final pyrolysis products observed at 1150 degrees C in the gas
   phase owing to competing intra- and intermolecular decomposition routes
   of 3. The decomposition routes of the starting compound 2 and of the
   primary intermediate 3 are discussed on the basis of experimental
   results and a computational study performed at the B3LYP/6-311G{*} and
   second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2/6311G{*} and RI-MP2/QZVPP) levels of
   theory.},

  abstract = {The rotation-torsion energies in the electronic ground state of HSOH
	are obtained in variational calculations based on a newly computed
	ab initio CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z potential energy surface. Using
	the concept of the reaction path Hamiltonian, as implemented in the
	program TROVE (theoretical rovibrational energies), the rotation-vibration
	Hamiltonian is expanded around geometries on the torsional minimum
	energy path of HSOH. The calculated values of the torsional splittings
	are in excellent agreement with experiment; the root-mean-square
	(rms) deviation is 0.0002 cm(-1) for all experimentally derived splittings
	(with J <= 40 and K(a)<= 4). The model provides reliable predictions
	for splittings not yet observed. The available experimentally derived
	torsion-rotation term values (with J <= 40 and K(a)<= 4) are reproduced
	ab initio with an rms deviation of 1.2 cm(-1) (0.7 cm(-1) for J <=
	20), which is improved to 1.0 cm(-1) (0.07 cm(-1) for J <= 20) in
	an empirical adjustment of the bond lengths at the planar trans configuration.
	The theoretical torsional splittings of HSOH are analyzed in terms
	of an existing semiempirical model for the rotation-torsion motion.
	The analysis explains the irregular variation of the torsional splittings
	with K(a) that has been observed experimentally. (C) 2008 American

  pages = {224312},
  abstract = {Accurate spectral data of (HSOH)-S-32 and (HSOH)-S-34 at 1.3 THz were
	recorded using a synthesizer based multiplier spectrometer. The spectra
	were analyzed together with data from an earlier study which contain
	measurements at 1.9 THz. The combination of both data sets allows
	to determine experimentally the tunneling splitting of energy levels
	with K-a = 4 and 5 for the first time. The obtained results are essential
	to test a novel model on torsional tunneling splitting in HSOH. Transitions
	with K-a= 1 <- 0, K-a = 2 <- 1, and K-a = 3 <- 2 all exhibit strong
	c-type and somewhat weaker b-type transitions. In contrary, transitions
	with K-a = 4 <- 3 display only c-type but no b-type transitions.
	The absence of b-type transitions is completely unexpected and yet
	not well understood. For the (HSOH)-S-34 isotopolog the data set
	has been substantially extended by the new measurements of (r)Q(3)-branch
	transitions at 1.3 THz. Based on the new data the accuracy of the
	H34SOH molecular parameters has been significantly improved. c 2008
