Abstract = {{Aviation NOx emissions lead to the production of ozone (O-3) and an OH
   increase in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. This OH increase
   results in a reduction of methane (CH4) which causes a longer-term
   reduction in O-3 concentrations and lower stratospheric water vapor
   (SWV). Here we report new evaluations of a more comprehensive suite of
   aviation NOx-induced steady-state radiative forcing (RF) for 2006
   aviation NOx emissions and for two different projections of 2050 NOx
   emissions and compare them with previously published analyses of
   aviation NOx-induced steady-state RFs. To do so, we evaluate the
   aviation NOx-induced steady-state RFs using the three-dimensional (3-D)
   global climate-chemistry Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), CAM4Chem.
   Moreover, we determine time dependent (transient) RFs for 2005 and the
   two 2050 emission scenarios by utilizing a parameterization based on
   specific RFs (steady-state RFs per unit of NOx emission) calculated in
   the 3-D model simulations, time-dependent NOx emissions data, and
   considering the lifetime of the perturbed species. For aviation
   NOx-induced effects we find that the net transient RFs differ from the
   linearly scaled steady-state RFs (specific steady-state RFs multiplied
   by NOx emissions) by +10\%-36\% for the different emission scenarios
   used in this study. These results indicate the importance of not using
   the transient and steady-state RF interchangeably, especially when
   comparing the aviation contribution in RF changes to contributions from
   other transportation sectors. Also, these results indicate that careful
   consideration is necessary when choosing whether to use the steady-state
   or transient RF when evaluating aviation NOx-induced RFs.}},
