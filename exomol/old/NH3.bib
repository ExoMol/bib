Abstract = {{Eleven instruments for the measurement of ambient concentrations of
   atmospheric ammonia gas (NH(3)), based on eight different measurement
   methods were inter-compared above an intensively managed agricultural
   field in late summer 2008 in Southern Scotland. To test the instruments
   over a wide range of concentrations, the field was fertilised with urea
   midway through the experiment, leading to an increase in the average
   concentration from 10 to 100 ppbv. The instruments deployed included
   three wet-chemistry systems, one with offline analysis (annular rotating
   batch denuder, RBD) and two with online-analysis (Annular Denuder
   sampling with online Analysis, AMANDA; AiRRmonia), two Quantum Cascade
   Laser Absorption Spectrometers (a large-cell dual system; DUAL-QCLAS,
   and a compact system; c-QCLAS), two photo-acoustic spectrometers
   (WaSul-Flux; Nitrolux-100), a Cavity Ring Down Spectrosmeter (CRDS), a
   Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), an ion mobility
   spectrometer (IMS) and an OpenPath Fourier Transform Infra-Red (OP-FTIR)
   Spectrometer. The instruments were compared with each other and with the
   average concentration of all instruments. An overall good agreement of
   hourly average concentrations between the instruments (R(2)>0.84), was
   observed for NH(3) concentrations at the field of up to 120 ppbv with
   the slopes against the average ranging from 0.67 (DUAL-QCLAS) to 1.13
   (AiRRmonia) with intercepts of -0.74 ppbv (RBD) to + 2.69 ppbv (CIMS).
   More variability was found for performance for lower concentrations(<10
   ppbv). Here the main factors affecting measurement precision are (a) the
   inlet design, (b) the state of inlet filters (where applicable), and (c)
   the quality of gas-phase standards (where applicable). By reference to
   the fast (1 Hz) instruments deployed during the study, it was possible
   to characterize the response times of the slower instruments.}},

Title = {{NEAR-INFRARED PHOTOMETRY OF Y DWARFS: LOW AMMONIA ABUNDANCE AND THE
   ONSET OF WATER CLOUDS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{799}},
Abstract = {{We present new near-infrared photometry for seven late-type T dwarfs and
   nine Y-type dwarfs, and lower limit magnitudes for a tenth Y dwarf,
   obtained at Gemini Observatory. We also present a reanalysis of H-band
   imaging data from the Keck Observatory Archive, for an 11th Y dwarf.
   These data are combined with earlier MKO-system photometry, Spitzer and
   WISE mid-infrared photometry, and available trigonometric parallaxes, to
   create a sample of late-type brown dwarfs that includes 10 T9-T9.5
   dwarfs or dwarf systems, and 16 Y dwarfs. We compare the data to our
   models, which include updated H-2 and NH3 opacity, as well as
   low-temperature condensate clouds. The models qualitatively reproduce
   the trends seen in the observed colors; however, there are discrepancies
   of around a factor of two in flux for the Y0-Y1 dwarfs, with T-eff
   approximate to 350-400 K. At T-eff similar to 400 K, the problems could
   be addressed by significantly reducing the NH3 absorption, for example
   by halving the abundance of NH3 possibly by vertical mixing. At T-eff
   similar to 350 K, the discrepancy may be resolved by incorporating thick
   water clouds. The onset of these clouds might occur over a narrow range
   in T-eff, as indicated by the observed small change in 5 mu m flux over
   a large change in J -W2 color. Of the known Y dwarfs, the reddest in
   J-W2 are WISEP J182831.08 + 265037.8 and WISE J085510.83-071442.5. We
   interpret the former as a pair of identical 300-350 K dwarfs, and the
   latter as a 250 K dwarf. If these objects are similar to 3 Gyr old,
   their masses are similar to 10 and similar to 5 Jupiter-masses,
   respectively.}},

bstract = {{The demand for more food is increasing fertilizer and land use, and the
   demand for more energy is increasing fossil fuel combustion, leading to
   enhanced losses of reactive nitrogen (N-r) to the environment. Many
   thresholds for human and ecosystem health have been exceeded owing to Nr
   pollution, including those for drinking water (nitrates), air quality
   (smog, particulate matter, ground-level ozone), freshwater
   eutrophication, biodiversity loss, stratospheric ozone depletion,
   climate change and coastal ecosystems (dead zones). Each of these
   environmental effects can be magnified by the `nitrogen cascade': a
   single atom of Nr can trigger a cascade of negative environmental
   impacts in sequence. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of Nr on
   the environment and human health, including an assessment of the
   magnitude of different environmental problems, and the relative
   importance of Nr as a contributor to each problem. In some cases, Nr
   loss to the environment is the key driver of effects (e.g. terrestrial
   and coastal eutrophication, nitrous oxide emissions), whereas in some
   other situations nitrogen represents a key contributor exacerbating a
   wider problem (e.g. freshwater pollution, biodiversity loss). In this
   way, the central role of nitrogen can remain hidden, even though it
   actually underpins many trans-boundary pollution problems.}},

Abstract = {Nearly 4800 features of ammonia between 6300 and 7000 cm(-1) with
   intensities >= 4 x 10(-24) cm(-1)/(molecule . cm(-2)) at 296 K were

   (296-185 K) with the McMath-Pierce Fourier Transform Spectrometer at
   Kitt Peak National Observatory, AZ. The line positions and intensities
   were retrieved by fitting individual spectra based on a Voigt line shape
   profile and then averaging the values to form the experimental linelist.
   The integrated intensity of the region was 4.68 x 10(-19)
   cm(-1)/(molecule . cm(-2)) at 296 K. Empirical lower state energies were
   also estimated for 3567 absorption line features using line intensities
   retrieved from 10 spectra recorded at gas temperature between 185 and
   233 K. Finally, using Ground State Combination Differences (GSCDs) and
   the empirical lower state energy estimates, the quantum assignments were
   determined for 1096 transitions in the room temperature linelist, along
   with empirical upper state energies for 434 levels. The assignments
   correspond to seven vibrational states, as confirmed from recent ab
   initio calculations. The resulting composite database of (NH3)-N-14 line
   parameters will provide experimental constraints to ab initio
   calculations and support remote sensing of gaseous bodies including the

Title = {Rovibrational spectra of ammonia. {I.} {U}nprecedented accuracy of a
   potential energy surface used with nonadiabatic corrections},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {134},
Abstract = {In this work, we build upon our previous work on the theoretical
   spectroscopy of ammonia, NH(3). Compared to our 2008 study, we include
   more physics in our rovibrational calculations and more experimental
   data in the refinement procedure, and these enable us to produce a
   potential energy surface (PES) of unprecedented accuracy. We call this
   the HSL-2 PES. The additional physics we include is a second-order
   correction for the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and
   we find it to be critical for improved results. By including
   experimental data for higher rotational levels in the refinement
   procedure, we were able to greatly reduce our systematic errors for the
   rotational dependence of our predictions. These additions together lead
   to a significantly improved total angular momentum (J) dependence in our
   computed rovibrational energies. The root-mean-square error between our
   predictions using the HSL-2 PES and the reliable energy levels from the
   HITRAN database for J = 0-6 and J = 7/8 for (14)NH(3) is only 0.015
   cm(-1) and 0.020/0.023 cm(-1), respectively. The root-mean-square errors
   for the characteristic inversion splittings are approximately 1/3
   smaller than those for energy levels. The root-mean-square error for the
   6002 J = 0-8 transition energies is 0.020 cm(-1). Overall, for J = 0-8,
   the spectroscopic data computed with HSL-2 is roughly an order of
   magnitude more accurate relative to our previous best ammonia PES
   (denoted HSL-1). These impressive numbers are eclipsed only by the
   root-mean-square error between our predictions for purely rotational
   transition energies of (15)NH(3) and the highly accurate Cologne
   database (CDMS): 0.00034 cm(-1) (10 MHz), in other words, 2 orders of
   magnitude smaller. In addition, we identify a deficiency in the
   (15)NH(3) energy levels determined from a model of the experimental
   data. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. {[}doi:10.1063/1.3541351]},

Abstract = {Several aspects of ammonia rovibrational spectra have been investigated
   using the new HSL-2 potential energy surface that includes an
   approximate correction for nonadiabatic effects. The unprecedented
   accuracy of rovibrational energy levels and transition energies computed
   using HSL-2 was demonstrated in Part I of this study. For (NH3)-N-14,
   new assignments for a few nu(3) + nu(4) band transitions and energy
   levels are suggested, and discrepancies between computed and HITRAN
   energy levels in the 2 nu(4) band are analyzed (2 nu(4) is the most
   difficult band below 5000 cm (1)). New assignments are suggested for
   existing or missing 2 nu(4) levels. Several new vibrational bands are
   identified from existing, unassigned HITRAN data, including 2 nu(2) +
   nu(4), (nu(3) + nu(4)) -A'/A `', nu(1) + 2 nu(2), and 2 nu(2) + 2 nu(4).
   The strong mixing between the 2 nu(4) and 2 nu(2) + nu(4) bands is
   carefully examined and found to be the source of the difficulties in the
   experimental modeling of 2 nu(4). Discussion is presented for
   preliminary J = 10 results, where the overall root-mean-square error is
   estimated to be less than 0.039 cm(-1). The analysis of the 4 nu(2) band
   demonstrates both the reliability and the accuracy of predictions from
   HSL-2. The full list of computed J = 0 band origins (with assignments)
   and the inversion splittings up to 7000-8000 cm(-1) above the zero-point
   energy are presented. J = 0-2 levels are reported for those bands below
   5100 cm(-1) that are missing from the HITRAN database. For (NH3)-N-15,
   excellent agreement is found for the available nu(2) and nu(3) +
   nu(4)(E) transition energies, but significant deficiencies are shown for
   HITRAN levels and several corrections are suggested. The N-15 isotopic
   effects are presented for the J = 0-6 levels of 13 HITRAN bands. For
   (ND3)-N-14, we reproduce the pure rotational inversion spectra line
   frequencies with an accuracy similar to that for (NH3)-N-14. However, it
   is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all four pairs of
   inversion-split vibrational fundamentals to better than 0.05 cm(-1)
   uncertainty. It is suggested that a reanalysis of some suspicious
   (ND3)-N-14 fundamental bands is required. The analyses presented here
   and in Part I show that rovibrational energy levels and transition
   frequencies computed with HSL-2 (with nonadiabatic corrections) remain
   highly accurate well beyond the experimental data used in the refinement
   procedure. Calculations using HSL-2 are capable of revealing many
   deficiencies in experimental analyses of ammonia spectra and provide
   reliable predictions with similar accuracy. It is expected that the
   results of this study will be useful in the future interpretation of
   high-resolution spectra from laboratory experiments or from astronomical
   observations. The present work represents a very significant advance in
   the state of our knowledge of the spectroscopy of ammonia and its
   isotopologues. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

 abstreact = {Complete and reliable knowledge of the ammonia spectrum is needed to enable the analysis and interpretation of astrophysical and planetary observations. Ammonia has been observed in the interstellar medium up to J = 18 and more highly excited transitions are expected to appear in hot exoplanets and brown dwarfs. As a result, there is considerable interest in observing and assigning the high J (rovibrational) spectrum. In this work, numerous spectroscopic techniques were employed to study its high J transitions in the ground and nu(2) = 1 states. Measurements were carried out using a frequency multiplied submillimeter spectrometer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a tunable far-infrared spectrometer at University of Toyama, and a high-resolution Bruker IFS 125 Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Highly excited ammonia was created with a radiofrequency discharge and a dc discharge, which allowed assignments of transitions with J up to 35. One hundred and seventy seven ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion transitions were observed with microwave accuracy in the 0.3-4.7 THz region. Of these, 125 were observed for the first time, including 26 Delta K = 3 transitions. Over 2000 far-infrared transitions were assigned to the ground state and nu(2) = 1 inversion bands as well as the nu(2) fundamental band. Of these, 1912 were assigned using the FTS data for the first time, including 222 Delta K = 3 transitions. The accuracy of these measurements has been estimated to be 0.0003-0.0006 cm(-1). A reduced root mean square error of 0.9 was obtained for a global fit of the ground and nu(2) = 1 states, which includes the lines assigned in this work and all previously available microwave, terahertz, far-infrared, and mid-infrared data. The new measurements and predictions reported here will support the analyses of astronomical observations by high-resolution spectroscopy telescopes such as Herschel, SOFIA, and ALMA. The comprehensive experimental rovibrational energy levels reported here will permit further refinement of the potential energy surface to improve ammonia ab initio calculations and facilitate assignment of new high-resolution spectra of hot ammonia.

   semiglobal potential energy surface of the electronic ground state of

   123), which exhibits mass-independent equilibrium NH bond length and a
   HNH bond angle of 1.0109 angstrom and 106.75 degrees, respectively, is
   employed together with the variational nuclear motion code GENIUSH (J.
   Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 134112; 2011, 134, 074105) to determine directly
   measurable, effective structural parameters of the (NH3)-N-14 and
   (ND3)-N-14 molecules. The effective r(g)- and r(a)-type NH(ND) distances
   determined at 300 K are 1.0307(1.0254) and 1.0256(1.0217) angstrom,
   respectively, with an estimated accuracy of 2 X 10(-4) angstrom. The
   effective theta(g) HNH and DND bond angles at 300 K are 106.91 degrees
   and 106.85 degrees, respectively. The root-mean-square amplitudes of
   vibration, l(g), for the NH(ND) distances at 300 K are 0.073(0.062)

   of a room-temperature gas-electron-diffraction study (J. Chem. Phys.

   0.073(2), r(g)(ND) = 1.027(3), and l(g)(ND) = 0.061(2). The computed
   difference in the r(g,T)(NH) bond lengths of the two spin isomers (Ortho
   and para forms) of (NH3)-N-14 is 3 x 10(-5) angstrom at 0 K, the
   difference diminishes at temperatures of about 30-50 K.},

abstract = { Intrapulse quantum cascade (QC) laser spectrometers are able to produce both saturation and molecular alignment of a gas sample owing to the rapid sweep of the radiation through the absorption features. In the QC lasers used to study the 14N and 15N isotopologues of the ν4 band of ammonia centered near 1625 cm–1, the variation of the chirp rate during the scan is very large, from ca. 85 to ca. 15 MHz ns–1. In the rapid chirp zone the collisional interaction time of the laser radiation with the gas molecules is short, and large rapid passage effects are seen, whereas at the slow chirp end the line shape resembles that of a Doppler broadened line. The total scan range of the QC laser of ca. 10 cm–1 is sufficient to allow the spectra of both isotopologues to be recorded and the rapid and slow interactions with the laser radiation to be seen. The rapid passage effects are enhanced by the use of an off axis Herriott cell with an effective path length of 62 m, which allows a buildup of polarization to occur. The effective resolution of the chirped QC laser is ca. 0.012 cm–1 full width at half-maximum in the 1625 cm–1 region. The results of these experiments are compared with those of other studies of the ν4 band of ammonia carried out using Fourier transform and Laser Stark spectroscopy. They also demonstrate the versatility of the down chirped QC laser for investigating collisional effects in low pressure gases using long absorbing path lengths. }

   contained in several high-resolution spectral databases. Using these new
   models we derive detailed cascade maps for these species, and obtain
   realistic fluorescence efficiencies applicable to high-resolution

   line-by-line spectra for a wide range of rotational temperatures. We
   validated the models by comparing simulated emissions of these nitrogen
   species with measured spectra of comet C/2007 W1 (Boattini) acquired
   with high-resolution infrared spectrometers at high altitude sites. The
   new models accurately describe the complex emission spectrum, providing
   distinct rotational temperatures and production rates at greatly
   improved accuracy compared with results derived from earlier
   fluorescence models. In addition, we made use of the completeness and
   scope of the new databases to investigate possible HCN <-> HNC radiative

CEAS data helped in this respect for the lowest J lines, some of which are
saturated in the CRDS spectrum. Further information on a/s doublets arose
from the observed spectral structures. Thirty-two transitions of 14NH3
were assigned in this way and a limited but significant number (19)
of changes in the assignments results, compared to Sung et�al. or to
Cacciani et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113 (2012), 1084).
Sixteen known and 25 new low-J transitions were identified for

Journal = JCP,
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {Analytic internal-coordinate representations are reported for two
   accurate ab initio spin-spin coupling surfaces of the ammonia molecule,
   (1)J ((15)N,H) and (2)J(H,H). Calculations were carried out at the level
   of the second-order polarization propagator approximation involving
   coupled-cluster singles and doubles amplitudes (CCSD) and using a large
   specialized basis set, for a total of 841 different geometries
   corresponding to 2523 distinct points on the (1)J ((15)N,H) and
   (2)J(H,H) surfaces. The results were fitted to power series expansions
   truncated after the fourth-order terms. While the one-bond
   nitrogen-hydrogen coupling depends more on the internuclear distance,
   the geminal hydrogen-hydrogen coupling exhibits a pronounced dependence
   on the bond angle. The spin-spin parameters are first vibrationally
   averaged, using vibrational wave functions obtained variationally from
   the TROVE computer program with a CCSD(T) based potential energy
   surface, for ammonia and its various deuterated isotopologues. The
   vibrationally averaged quantities are then thermally averaged to give
   values of the couplings at absolute temperatures of 300 and 600 K. We
   find that the nuclear-motion corrections are rather small. The computed

Abstract = {We present a new model for the rotation-vibration motion of pyramidal

   treated as a large-amplitude motion, while the small-amplitude
   vibrations are described by linearized stretching and bending
   coordinates. The rotation-vibration Schrodinger equation is solved
   variationally. We report three applications of the model to (NH3)-N-14
   using an analytic potential function derived from high-level ab initio
   calculations. These applications address the J = 0 vibrational energies
   up to 6100 cm, the J less than or equal to 2 energies for the
   vibrational ground state and the nu(2), nu(4), and 2nu(2) excited
   vibrational states, and the J less than or equal to 7 energies for the
   4nu(2)(+) vibrational state. We demonstrate that also for four-atomic
   molecules, theoretical calculations of rotation-vibration energies can
   be helpful in the interpretation and assignment of experimental,
   high-resolution rotation vibration spectra. Our approach incorporates an
   optimum inherent separation of different types of nuclear motion and

abstract = {Abstract Accurate, experimental rotational–vibrational energy levels and line positions, with associated labels and uncertainties, are reported for the ground electronic state of the symmetric-top 14NH3 molecule. All levels and lines are based on critically reviewed and validated high-resolution experimental spectra taken from 56 literature sources. The transition data are in the 0.7–17&#xa0;000&#xa0;cm−1 region, with a large gap between 7000 and 15&#xa0;000&#xa0;cm−1. The \{MARVEL\} (Measured Active Rotational–Vibrational Energy Levels) algorithm is used to determine the energy levels. Out of the 29&#xa0;450 measured transitions 10&#xa0;041 and 18&#xa0;947 belong to ortho- and para-14NH3, respectively. A careful analysis of the related experimental spectroscopic network (SN) allows 28&#xa0;530 of the measured transitions to be validated, 18&#xa0;178 of these are unique, while 462 transitions belong to floating components. Despite the large number of spectroscopic measurements published over the last 80 years, the transitions determine only 30 vibrational band origins of 14NH3, 8 for ortho- and 22 for para-14NH3. The highest J value, where J stands for the rotational quantum number, for which an energy level is validated is 31. The number of experimental-quality ortho- and para-14NH3 rovibrational energy levels is 1724 and 3237, respectively. The \{MARVEL\} energy levels are checked against ones in the \{BYTe\} first-principles database, determined previously. The lists of validated lines and levels for 14NH3 are deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper. Combination of the \{MARVEL\} energy levels with first-principles absorption intensities yields a huge number of experimental-quality rovibrational lines, which should prove to be useful for the understanding of future complex high-resolution spectroscopy on 14NH3; these lines are also deposited in the Supporting Information to this paper. }

Abstract = {A spectroscopic study of ammonia molecule in the 23 mu m water
   atmospheric window is presented. Compared to previous experimental works
   a narrow, broadly tunable, continuous laser source was applied in order
   to obtain high resolution spectra in this range. It was the first
   application of the newly developed Vertical External Cavity Surface
   Emitting Laser (VECSEL). The analysis of the absorption spectra of two
   different isotopologue admixtures allowed to identify 336 (NH3)-N-14 and
   244 (NH3)-N-15 lines in the studied region from 4275 to 4340 cm(-1).
   These data were compared to previous line list based on experimental
   data - the HITRAN database and the work of Urban et al., as well as to
   the theoretical predictions by Yurchenko et al. and Huang et al.
   Together for 235 (NH3)-N-14 and 183 (NH3)-N-15 lines a complete
   assignment was proposed. From those 63 (NH3)-N-14 and 114 (NH3)-N-15
   transitions were newly assigned. The complete peaklist of transitions
   containing ro-vibrational state identifications is presented in
   Supplementary materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Systematic analysis of the temperature dependence of the intensity ratio
   between already assigned and unassigned transitions enabled the
   determination of the most probable energy of the lower state of the
   unassigned transition. Such a procedure has been applied to transitions
   of (NH3)-N-14 ammonia in the range 6626-6805 cm(-1) between 130 and 300
   K. This information is of great interest in the considerable task of the
   assignment of the complete 1.5 mu m infrared spectral range where
   combination and overtone vibrational bands are present. 2451 transitions
   have been observed at different temperatures. For 2133 the line strength
   and for 1956 transitions the values of lower state energies were
   derived. Our work was compared with recent Fourier transform study
   covering a larger energy range (6300-7000 cm(-1)) with smaller
   temperature range (185-296 K)},
