Abstract = {The low-lying electronic states (X-2 Pi, a(4)Pi, b(4)Sigma(-), B-2 Pi,
   1(2)Phi, A(2)Delta and B'(2)Sigma(+)) of the NS molecule are computed at
   the AV5Z/CASSCF/MRCI+Q+DK level of theory. The potential energy curves
   are presented for these states; the corresponding spectroscopic
   constants are reported. Electronic transition moment functions, Einstein
   coefficients, Franck-Condon factors and radiative lifetimes for the B-2
   Pi-X-2 Pi, B'(2)Sigma(+)-X-2 Pi and A(2)Delta-X-2 Pi system have been
   calculated. The F-C factors of the (BII)-I-2 are in good agreement with
   the corresponding RKR data. The B'(2)Sigma(+) state possesses a barrier
   in the potential energy curve, located at about 2.16 angstrom. The
   height of the barrier is predicted to be 7890 cm(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Spin-orbit splitting in the X-2 Pi, a(4)Pi, B-2 Pi and H-2 Pi electronic
   states of the NS radical},

Abstract = {The potential energy curves (PECs) of ten Omega states (X-2 Pi(1/2,3/2),
   a(4)Pi(1/2,1/2,3/2,5/2), B-2 Pi(1/2,3/2) and H-2 Pi(1/2,3/2)) generated
   from four Lambda-S states (X-2 Pi, a(4)Pi, B-2 Pi and H-2 Pi) of the NS
   radical are studied in detail for the first time using an ab initio
   quantum chemical method. All the PEC calculations are performed for
   internuclear separations from 0.10 to 1.11 nm by the complete active
   space self-consistent field method followed by the internally contracted
   multireference configuration interaction approach with the Davidson
   modifications (MRCI + Q). The spin-orbit coupling (SO) effect is
   accounted for by the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian. To discuss the effect on
   the energy splitting by the core-electron correlations, two all-electron
   basis sets, cc-pCVTZ and cc-pVTZ, are used for the SO coupling
   calculations. To improve the quality of the PECs, core-valence
   correlation and relativistic corrections are included. Core-valence
   correlation corrections are included with a cc-pCVTZ basis set.
   Relativistic correction calculations are carried out using the
   third-order Douglas-Kroll Hamiltonian approximation at the level of a
   cc-pV5Z basis set. The spectroscopic parameters of four Lambda-S states
   and ten Omega states are calculated. Excellent agreement is found
   between the present results and the measurements. Using the PECs
   obtained by the MRCI + Q/AV5Z+ CV + DK + SO calculations, the
   G(upsilon), B-upsilon and D-upsilon are calculated for each vibrational
   state of each Omega state, and those of the first 30 vibrational states
   are reported for the X-2 Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2), B-2 Pi(1/2) and B-2
   Pi(3/2) states of the (NS)-N-14-S-32 radical. The spectroscopic
   parameters of four Omega states of the a(4)Pi and the G(upsilon),
   B-upsilon and D-upsilon of the X-2 Pi(1/2), X-2 Pi(3/2), B-2 Pi(1/2) and
   B-2 Pi(3/2) states reported here are expected to be reliable predicted
   results.},
