	for all low-lying states, including some vibrationally excited levels,
	are used in a least squares fit to the supermultiplet model. A crucial

	are in better agreement with theoretical descriptions than previous
	empirical constants taken directly, without deperturbation, from

	with D(2) are studied in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer.
	The products observed are Ni(n)D(+) for all clusters and Ni(n)D(2)(+)
	for n=5-16. Reactions for formation of Ni(n)D(+) are observed to
	exhibit thresholds, whereas cross sections for formation of Ni(n)D(2)(+)
	(n=5-16) exhibit no obvious barriers to reaction. Rate constants
	of D(2) chemisorption on the cationic clusters are compared with
	results from previous work on neutral nickel clusters. Ni(n)(+)-D
	bond energies as a function of cluster size are derived from threshold
	analysis of the kinetic-energy dependence of the endothermic reactions,
	and are compared to previously determined metal-metal bond energies,
	D(0)(Ni(n)(+)-Ni). The bond energies of Ni(n)(+)-D generally increase
	as the cluster size increases, and parallel those for Ni(n)(+)-Ni
	for many clusters. These trends are explained in terms of electronic
	and geometric structures for the Ni(n)(+) clusters. The bond energies
	of Ni(n)(+)-D for larger clusters (ngreater than or equal to11) are
	found to be close to the value for chemsorption of atomic hydrogen

  abstract = {In the present work we investigate the adequacy of broken-symmetry
	unrestricted density functional theory for constructing the potential
	energy curve of nickel dimer and nickel hydride, as a model for larger
	bare and hydrogenated nickel cluster calculations. We use three hybrid
	functionals: the popular B3LYP, Becke's newest optimized functional
	Becke98, and the simple FSLYP functional (50\% Hartree-Fock and 50\%
	Slater exchange and LYP gradient-corrected correlation functional)
	with two basis sets: all-electron (AE) Wachters+f basis set and Stuttgart
	RSC effective core potential (ECP) and basis set. We find that, overall,
	the best agreement with experiment, comparable to that of the high-level
	CASPT2, is obtained with B3LYP/AE, closely followed by Becke98/AE
	and Becke98/ECP. FSLYP/AE and B3LYP/ECP give slightly worse agreement
	with experiment, and FSLYP/ECP is the only method among the ones
	we studied that gives an unacceptably large error, underestimating
	the dissociation energy of Ni-2 by 28\%, and being in the largest
	disagreement with the experiment and the other theoretical predictions.
	We also find that for Ni-2, the spin projection for the broken-symmetry
	unrestricted singlet states changes the ordering of the states, but
	the splittings are less than 10 meV. All our calculations predict
	a deltadelta-hole ground state for Ni-2 and delta-hole ground state
	for NiH. Upon spin projection of the singlet state of Ni-2, almost
	all of our calculations: Becke98 and FSLYP both AE and ECP and B3LYP/AE
	predict (1)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y 2)(B)) or (1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B))
	ground state, which is a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and (1)Gamma(g).
	B3LYP/ECP predicts a (3)(d(x 2-y 2)(A)d(xy)(B)) (mixture of (3)Sigma(g)(-)
	and (3)Gamma(u)) ground state virtually degenerate with the (1)(d(x
	2-y 2)(A)d(x 2-y 2)(B))/(1)(d(xy)(A)d(xy)(B)) state. The doublet
	delta-hole ground state of NiH predicted by all our calculations
	is in agreement with the experimentally predicted (2)Delta ground
	state. For Ni-2, all our results are consistent with the experimentally
	predicted ground state of 0(g)(+) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(g)(+) and
	(3)Sigma(g)(-)) or 0(u)(-) (a mixture of (1)Sigma(u)(-) and (3)Sigma(u)(+)).

	of bonding and antibonding states together with hydrogen-induced
	volume expansion. We demonstrate that the characteristic XMCD profile
	of the TM hydrides near the absorption edge probed the reconstruction
	of the electronic structure above E-F. The pressure dependence of
	XMCD revealed that the ferromagnetic state of FeH is less stable
	than that of CoH under pressure. The different hydrogenation processes
	between CoH and NiH at room temperature are reported by means of
	x-ray diffraction.},

  abstract = {Fourier transform spectra of collisionally induced fluorescence following
	isotopically selective laser excitation of NiH at similar to 550
	nm have located an excited Omega = 1/2 state of NiH lying 17900 cm(-1)
	above the electronic ground state. This is identified as v = 0 of
	a (2)Pi(1/2) state originating from an Ni+ 3d(8)4s(1) F-2 configuration.
	Emission from this Omega ` = 1/2 state occurs predominantly to v
	`' = 0 and 1 of the (2)Sigma(+) and W-2 (2)Pi(1/2) ligand field states,
	locating elusive f parity levels of W-2 (2)Pi(1/2) up to 5600 cm(-1)
	above the first rotational level of the electronic ground state,
	X-1 (2)Delta(5/2). Collisionally induced fluorescence following laser
	excitation at lower energies has also been recorded in the presence
	of a magnetic field (0.7-1 T), at Doppler limited resolution. Effective
	Lande factors g(J) for rotational levels of the v = 0 and 1 levels
	of the low-lying Omega `' = 5/2 and 3/2 components of the (2)Delta
	and (2)Pi states of NiH have been derived from partially resolved
	Zeeman patterns. About 1600 transitions recorded in field-free conditions
	have been reduced to term energies relative to the lowest level of
	the ground state. They confirm strong spin-orbit mixing between the
	low-lying ligand-field states.},
