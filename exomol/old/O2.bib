Abstract = {{Until recently the B (b(1)Sigma(+)(g) (nu=1)-X(3)Sigma(-)(g) (nu=0)) and
   gamma (b(1)Sigma(+)(g) (nu=2)-X(3)Sigma(-)(g) (nu=0)) bands of oxygen in
   the visible region had not been used extensively in satellite remote
   sensing of the atmosphere. These bands roughly cover the regions around
   14,527 and 15,904 cm(-1), respectively (0.69 and 0.63 mu m). However,
   these bands (in particular the B-band) are now being increasingly
   considered for future satellite missions. In this light, it is important
   to make sure that the reference spectroscopic parameters allow accurate
   retrieval of important physical characteristics from the atmospheric
   spectra. The spectroscopic parameters currently given for these bands in
   the HITRAN2008 spectroscopic database were tested against
   high-resolution atmospheric spectra measured with solar-pointing Fourier
   transform spectrometers at Park Falls, Wisconsin (B-band) and Kitt Peak,
   Arizona (gamma-band). It was found that the current HITRAN parameters
   cannot produce satisfactory fits of the observed spectra. In order to
   improve the database we have collected the best available measured line
   positions that involve the b(1)E(g)(+) (nu=1 and nu=2) states for the
   three most abundant isotopologues of oxygen and performed a combined fit
   to obtain a consistent set of spectroscopic constants. These constants
   were then used to calculate the line positions. A careful review of the
   available intensity and line-shape measurements was also carried out,
   and new parameters were derived based on that review. In particular,
   line shift parameters, that were not previously available, were
   introduced. The new data have been validated using the high-resolution
   atmospheric spectra measured with the Fourier transform spectrometers at
   Park Falls, Wisconsin (B-band) and Kitt Peak, Arizona (gamma-band) and
   have yielded substantial improvement. In addition, we report the first
   direct observation and analysis of the (16)O(18)O lines in the
   gamma-band. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   isotopologues of oxygen - O-16-O-17, (OO)-O-17-O-18 and O-17(2) - was

   band was observed for all three O-17 isotopologues. At liquid nitrogen
   temperature, some of the transitions were observed with partially
   resolved hyperfine splitting due to the O-17 nuclear spin. The electric
   quadrupole (0-0) band and the (1-1) hot band were also observed for the
   180170 and O-17(2) species. The rotational and hyperfine spectroscopic
   parameters of the X-3 Sigma(-)(g) and a(1)Delta(g) states of the three

   line positions and microwave and Raman measurements available in the

Journal = JQSRT,

Abstract = {{Electric quadrupole transitions in the a(1)Delta(g)-X-3 Sigma(-)(g) band
   of O-16(2) near 1.27 mu m are reported for the first time. They were
   first detected in atmospheric solar spectra acquired with a ground-based
   Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) in Park Falls, WI. Subsequently
   high-sensitivity ON cavity ring down spectroscopy (CW-CRDS) experiments
   were carried out at Grenoble University in the 7717-7917 cm(-1) region
   in order to provide quantitative intensity information for the electric
   quadrupole transitions. Measured intensities were used as input data for
   the calculation of the complete list of electric quadrupole transitions
   with Delta J= +/- 2, +/- 1 and 0. The calculation was carried out for
   the intermediate coupling case and assuming that these transitions are
   possible only through mixing of the Omega=0 component of the ground
   electronic state and b(1)Sigma(+)(g) state induced by spin-orbit
   coupling. The calculated line list agrees well with experimental
   measurements and was used to improve the residuals of the fitted solar
   atmospheric spectrum. Emission probability for the electric quadrupole
   band was determined to be (1.02 +/- 0.10) x 10(-6)s(-1). (C) 2010

Journal = JCP,

Abstract = {{As part of a comprehensive review on molecular oxygen spectroscopy, we
   have measured rotational spectra of isotopic forms of molecular oxygen
   in its a(1)Delta(g) electronic state with high-resolution terahertz
   spectroscopy. The data are recorded in close proximity to predicted
   positions. Due to the high resolution and good signal-to-noise ratio,
   the fundamental hyperfine parameters eQq and CI are determinable for
   O-17-substituted species for the first time. A refined nuclear spin
   orbit coupling constant, a = -211.9328(283) MHz, was determined, and is
   roughly two orders of magnitude more precise than values determined from
   near infrared spectroscopy or electron spin resonance studies.
   Vibrationally excited oxygen in the a(1)Delta(g) electronic state was
   also observable with small signal levels for many of the rotational

   the B-3 Sigma(+)(u) state from O(P-3)+O(D-1) within state-of-the-art

   Dunham fit for the lowest three electronic states, X-3 Sigma(-)(g),
