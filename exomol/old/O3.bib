Abstract = {{The state of the art analyses of high-resolution ozone spectra and a
   critical discussion of line parameters updated since the previous review
   by Rinsland et al. {[}J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transfer 2003;82:207-18]
   are presented. We focus on recent works revisiting improved measurements
   and analyses of Fourier transform spectra below 5600 cm(-1) and review
   Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy measurements and analyses in the 5850-7920
   cm(-1) spectral region which have been performed for O-16(3) and all
   O-18 enriched ozone isotopologues. Various issues related to resonance
   perturbations due to dark states are discussed as well as the issues
   concerning the accuracy of the experimental parameters, the data
   modelling and the data reduction. Comparisons of vibration levels
   determined from spectra analyses with predictions from the molecular
   potential functions are given. The procedures of empirical corrections
   for calculated line lists are described and the ``intricate{''} question
   of absolute intensity determination is overviewed. Also, a review of
   deficiencies, challenge for improvements, and related works in progress
   are reported. }},
