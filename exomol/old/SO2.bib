   using a CO laser, the laser line corresponding to the 32-31 D 5
   transition is promising for temperatures T = 300-1100 K. In addition,
   the most suitable range of the spectrum for passive sensing of hot SO2

Journal = PNAS,

Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {17697-17702},
Abstract = {{Signatures of mass-independent isotope fractionation (MIF) are found in
   the oxygen (O-16, O-17, O-18) and sulfur (S-32, S-33, S-34, S-36)
   isotope systems and serve as important tracers of past and present
   atmospheric processes. These unique isotope signatures signify the
   breakdown of the traditional theory of isotope fractionation, but the
   physical chemistry of these isotope effects remains poorly understood.
   We report the production of large sulfur isotope MIF, with Delta S-33 up
   to 78\% and Delta S-36 up to 110\%, from the broadband excitation of SO2
   in the 250-350-nm absorption region. Acetylene is used to selectively
   trap the triplet-state SO2 ((a) over tilde B-3(1)), which results from
   intersystem crossing from the excited singlet ((A) over tilde
   (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) states. The observed MIF signature
   differs considerably from that predicted by isotopologue-specific
   absorption cross-sections of SO2 and is insensitive to the wavelength
   region of excitation (above or below 300 nm), suggesting that the MIF
   originates not from the initial excitation of SO2 to the singlet states
   but from an isotope selective spin-orbit interaction between the singlet
   ((A) over tilde (1)A(2)/(B) over tilde B-1(1)) and triplet ((a) over
   tilde B-3(1)) manifolds. Calculations based on high-level potential
   energy surfaces of the multiple excited states show a considerable
   lifetime anomaly for (SO2)-S-33 and (SO2)-S-36 for the low vibrational
   levels of the (A) over tilde (1)A(2) state. These results demonstrate
   that the isotope selectivity of accidental near-resonance interactions
   between states is of critical importance in understanding the origin of
   MIF in photochemical systems.}},

The line lists are based on J=0-80 rovibrational variational calculations with E’ ⩽ 8000 cm-1. The 34S16O2 and 33S16O2 line lists are compared to the experiment-based models in the HIgh-resolution \{TRANsmission\} molecular absorption database (HITRAN2012, http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/) and the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, \{CDMS\} (http://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms/). The accuracy for computed 646 band origins is similar to what has been reported for the main isotopologue, i.e. 0.01 – 0.03 cm-1 for bands up to 5500 cm-1. For rovibrational transitions, the 646 line position and intensity deviation patterns are much simpler and more self-consistent than those of the main isotopologue 626. The discrepancies are mainly found for higher Ka/J transitions. 626 and 646 exhibit comparable line position and intensity agreement for lower Ka/J transitions. The line position deviations for the 636 purely rotational band are parallel to those of 626 and 646, while its line intensity deviations do not show branching patterns as we found in the 626 and 646 cases. Predictions for the other minor isotopologues are expected to exhibit similar accuracy. These line lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives for missing bands of 626 and the minor isotopologues. It may significantly facilitate the laboratory spectroscopic measurement and analysis, as well as to identify these isotopologues in various astrophysical environments. }

   submillimeter rotational transitions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfur

   previously reported limits, whereas for H2S we set a more stringent

   Among the targeted molecules, SO2 is the strongest indicator for
   volcanic outgassing. Assuming a photochemical lifetime of 2 years for
   SO2, our upper limit of 1.1 ppb implies an outgassing rate less than 55
   metric tons/day. This rate limits the daily amount of degassing magma to
   less than 12,000 m(3). Our sensitivity is sufficient to detect a
   volcanic release on Mars that is 4\% the SO2 released continuously from
