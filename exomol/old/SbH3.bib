Abstract = {For the stibine isotopologue (SbH3)-Sb-121, we report improved
   theoretical calculations of the vibrational energies below 8000 cm- and
   simulations of the rovibrational spectrum in the 0-8000 cm(-1) region.
   The calculations are based on a refined ab initio potential energy
   surface and on a new dipole moment surface obtained at the coupled
   cluster CCSD(T) level. The theoretical results are compared with the
   available experimental data in order to validate the ab initio surfaces
   and the TROVE computational method {[}Yurchenko SN, Thiel vv, Jensen P.J
   mol Spectrosc 2007;245:126-40] for calculating rovibrational energies
   and simulating rovibrational spectra of arbitrary molecules in isolated
   electronic states. A number of predicted vibrational energies of
   (SbH3)-Sb-121 are provided in order to stimulate new experimental
   investigations of stibine. The localmode character of the vibrations in
   stibine is demonstrated through an analysis of the results in terms of
   local-mode theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
