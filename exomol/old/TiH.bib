   molecules were made in a titanium hollow cathode lamp operated with a
   mixture of neon and hydrogen or deuterium gases. A heavily perturbed
   band system near 938 nm is assigned as a (4)Phi-X (4)Phi electronic
   transition. Line positions and approximate spectroscopic constants are
   reported for the 0-0 band of the new transition. The (4)Phi-X (4)Phi TiH

   deposition and the appearance of the new TiH and TiH3 radicals with
   laser evaporation. The assignments were based on concentration
   dependence and isotopic substitution and were confirmed by SCF frequency
   calculations. The stable D-3h titanium trihydride radical was identified
   from agreement between calculated and observed values for the eight
   active stretching frequencies for TiH3, TiH2D, TiHD2, and TiD3. Both
   experimental and theoretical results show that H atoms play an important

   recent possible identification in the L subdwarf 2MASS J0532 of the 0.94

Abstract = {We investigate gas-phase neutral and cationic hydrides formed by 3d

   methods. The performance of two exchange-correlation functionals,
   Boese-Martin for kinetics (BMK) and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
   (TPSS), in predicting bond lengths and energetics, electronic
   structures, dipole moments, and ionization potentials is evaluated in
   comparison with available experimental data. To ensure a unique
   self-consistent field (SCF) solution, we use stability analysis, Fermi
   smearing, and continuity analysis of the potential energy curves.
   Broken-symmetry approach was adapted in order to get the qualitatively
   correct description of the bond dissociation. We found that on average
   BMK predicted values of dissociation energies and ionization potentials
   are closer to experiment than those obtained with high level wave
   function theory methods. This agreement deteriorates quickly when the
   fraction of the Hartree-Fock exchange in DFT functional is decreased.
   Natural bond orbital (NBO) population analysis was used to describe the
   details of chemical bonding in the systems studied. The multireference
   character in the wave function description of the hydrides is reproduced
   in broken-symmetry DFT description, as evidenced by NBO analysis. We
   also propose a new scheme to correct for spin contamination arising in
   broken-symmetry DFT approach. Unlike conventional schemes, our spin
   correction is introduced for each spin-polarized electron pair
   individually and therefore is expected to yield more accurate energy
   values. We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure
   singlet state from the energy of the broken-symmetry DFT description of
   the low spin state and the energies of the high spin states (pentuplet
   and two spin-contaminated triplets in the case of two spin-polarized
   electron pairs). The high spin states are build with canonical natural
   orbitals and do not require SCF convergence.},

A self-consistent hybrid Hartree-Fock/density functional method was validated by computing a number of properties for the whole series of neutral and cationic hydrides of first-row transition metals. The binding energies for the cationic species are significantly improved with respect to those provided by standard density functionals, reaching an accuracy comparable to that of the most sophisticated post-Hartree-Fock approaches. The results are slightly worse for neutral species, although the improvement with respect to conventional density functionals is still significant. At the same time, the computed bond lengths and dipole moments are in remarkable agreement with the available experimental data. ï¿½ 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

Abstract = {A method of analysis is proposed and applied to the rotational spectra

   polynomial assuming that the spectrum is a smooth function of angular
   momentum (the total angular momentum of the system). As a matter of
   fact, the measured spectra often show some irregularities (deviations
   from a smooth behavior) and this becomes clearly visible if one
   analyzes: the data in terms of the present method. This method of
   analysis therefore detects at which angular moments the irregularities
   occur in the data and such information would be most useful for
   understanding the nature of the perturbation which is responsible for
   the occurrence of irregularities. How the actual spectra would look like
