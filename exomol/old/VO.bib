	Abstract = {From near-infrared, narrow-band photometry of 256 oxygen-rich Mira
   variables we obtain evidence about the loops that these stars follow in
   colour-colour diagrams. We also find a phase lag between indices related
   to molecular band-strength of titanium oxide and vanadium oxide. We
   compute colours for normal M-giants and Miras using hydrostatic and
   hydrodynamic model atmospheres and very extensive up-to-date line lists.
   Normal M-giants colours are well reproduced, reaching a high
   quantitative agreement with observations for spectral types earlier than
   M7. The out-of-phase variations of the various spectral features of
   Miras are also acceptably reproduced, despite limitations in the
   modelling. This enables us to confirm that the phase lag phenomenon
   results from the propagation of perturbations in the extended
   atmosphere. It opens new perspectives in the spectral modelling of
   Miras.},

	Abstract = {The geometric configurations, vibration frequencies, vertical electron
   affinity energy, vertical ionization energies and energy levels of
   gaseous VOx (x = 1 similar to 5) were calculated with a B3LYP method
   under relativistic effective core potential (RECP) (O/6-311 + + g(d),
   V/LANL2DZ). The calculations show that the electronic ground states of
   the series molecules are as follows: VO ((4)Sigma), VO2 ((2)A(1)), VO3
   ((2)A `'), VO4 ((2)A(2)) and VO5 (B-4(2)) The geometric configurations
   of the ground states VOx (x = 3 similar to 5) are stereo- structures,
   which exhibit obvious John-Teller or Renner-Teller effect, that is, the
   higher the stability is, the lower the symmetry is. Their first vertical
   ionization energies increase with the number of oxygen atoms in VOx (x =
   1 similar to 4). The molecule VO3 ((2)A `') has the largest vertical
   electron affinity energy in VOx (x = 1 similar to 5) and the strongest
   attraction for electron among these molecules. The energy of the highest
   occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) decreases with the number of oxygen
   atoms in VOx, (x = 1 similar to 4), but the rule can not be applied to
   VO5. From he views of electron transition, the VO4 molecule has the most
   stable structure and the VO has the most unstable structure. The average
   length of VO bonds of their ground states of the series molecules
   increases with the O atom numbers.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of two occultations of the extrasolar planet WASP-33b using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope , which allow us to constrain the temperature structure and composition of its dayside atmosphere. WASP-33b is the most highly irradiated hot Jupiter discovered to date, and the only exoplanet known to orbit a δ -Scuti star. We observed in spatial scan mode to decrease instrument systematic effects in the data, and removed fluctuations in the data due to stellar pulsations. The rms for our final, binned spectrum is 1.05 times the photon noise. We compare our final spectrum, along with previously published photometric data, to atmospheric models of WASP-33b spanning a wide range in temperature profiles and chemical compositions. We find that the data require models with an oxygen-rich chemical composition and a temperature profile that increases at high altitude. We find that our measured spectrum displays an excess in the measured flux toward short wavelengths that is best explained as emission from TiO. If confirmed by additional measurements at shorter wavelengths, this planet would become the first hot Jupiter with a thermal inversion that can be definitively attributed to the presence of TiO in its dayside atmosphere.},

	Abstract = {The 3d-element transition metal dioxide MO(2), peroxide M(O(2)), and
   superoxide MOO clusters (M=Sc-Zn), are studied by density functional
   theory with the B1LYP functional. The reliability of the methods and
   basis sets employed was tested by a reinvestigation of the monoxides,
   for which a database of experimental data is available. The global
   minima on the M+O(2) potential energy surfaces correspond to dioxide
   structure, the only exception being CuOO, with a superoxide structure.
   All Zn dioxygen clusters are thermodynamically unstable-their ground
   states lie higher than the dissociation limit to Zn+O(2). Our
   calculations are in favor of the high-spin configurations for the
   FeO(2), CoO(2), and NiO(2) ground states, which are still a subject of
   extensive theoretical and experimental studies. These assignments are
   confirmed by the coupled-cluster method, CCSD(T), except for NiO(2).
   Based on the existence of a stable NiO(2) monoanion in a (4)B(1) state,
   however, it can be concluded that NiO(2) in its (5)A(1) state should
   also be stable. The vibrational frequencies are calculated for clusters
   entrapped in the cubic cell of solid Ar matrix and compared with those
   obtained for gas-phase clusters. The matrix has no influence on the
   vibrations of the monoxides and most of the dioxides; however, Co and
   Ni-dioxoclusters interact strongly with the atoms from the noble gas
   matrix. The most intense frequencies in the IR spectra are shifted to
   lower energies and the ordering of the low-lying electronic states by
   stability is also reversed. According to the electrostatic potential
   maps, the oxygen atoms in the peroxides are more nucleophilic than those
   in the dioxides and superoxides. The terminal oxygen atom in superoxides
   is more nucleophilic than its M-bonded oxygen atom, though charge
   distribution analysis predicts a smaller negative charge on the terminal
   oxygen. TiO(2) is the only dioxide in which nucleophilic character in
   the vicinity of the metal cation is induced. (C) 2008 American Institute

	Abstract = {We present a systematic first-principles study of the equilibrium bond
   lengths, harmonic frequencies, dissociation energies, ground state
   symmetries, and spin state splittings of 22 diatomic molecules comprised
   of a first-row 3d transition-metal and a main-group element (H, C, N, O,
   or F). Diatomic molecules are building blocks of the key molecular
   bonding motifs in biological and inorganic catalytic systems, but, at
   the same time, their small size permits a thorough study by even the
   most computationally expensive quantum chemistry approaches. The results
   of several density-functional theory (DFT) approaches including hybrid,
   generalized-gradient, and generalized-gradient augmented with Hubbard U
   exchange-correlation functionals are presented. We compare these
   efficiently calculated DFT results with the highly accurate but
   computationally expensive post-Hartree-Fock approaches multireference
   configuration interaction (MRCI) and coupled cluster {[}CCSD(T)] as well
   as experimental values, where available. We show that by employing a
   Hubbard U approach, we systematically reduce average errors in state
   splittings and dissociation energies by a factor of 3. We are also able
   to reassign the ground state of four molecules improperly identified by
   hybrid or generalized-gradient approaches and provide correct assignment
   of all ground state symmetries as compared against experimental
   assignment and MRCI reference. By providing accuracy comparable to more
   expensive quantum chemistry approaches with the robust scaling of the
   generalized-gradient approximation, our DFT+U approach permits the study
   of very large scale systems with vastly improved results. (c) 2010

	Abstract = {The first spectroscopic characterization of the VO2 radical is reported
   along with new results for (VO)-O-17 and tentative assignments for the
   VO3 and V-2(+) radicals. These vanadium radicals were investigated in
   neon matrices at 4 K by electron spin resonance utilizing conventional
   high temperature vaporization and pulsed laser ablation generation
   methods. A detailed ESR study of VO, showed it to be nonlinear with a
   (2)A(1) ground state; the g tensor analysis reveals the presence of an
   excited electronic state (B-2(1)) approximately 1 eV above the ground
   state. This excited state prediction and the observed nuclear hyperfine
   interactions (A tensors) for V-51 and O-17 were compared with
   theoretical results obtained from various ab initio computational
   methods. Ab initio calculations with an extended basis set were
   performed at various levels of theory including UHF, ROHF, CAS-SCF, and
   MR-SDCI (multireference single and double configuration interaction).
   While UHF calculations of the hyperfine interaction were grossly in
   error, the better levels of theory gave qualitative agreement with
   experiment and provided an aid to interpretation. VO2 is predicted to be
   a bent (2)A(1) state, correlating with the linear (2) Delta
   configuration having the odd electron predominantly in the V 3d orbital.
   VO3 is predicted to be planar C-2 upsilon, with the odd electron in a
   b(2) orbital localized in the oxygen in-plane n-type p orbitals. (C)

	Abstract = {We report on a photoelectron spectroscopic study of monovanadium oxides,
   VOx- (x = 1-4), at four photon energies: 532, 355, 266, and 193 nm.
   Vibrationally resolved spectra are obtained for VO- at 532 and 355 nm
   detachment photon energies. Two new low-lying excited states are
   observed for VO at 5630 and 14 920 cm(-1) above the ground state. These
   states are assigned to two doublet states, (2) Sigma(-) and (2) Phi,
   respectively. The 532 and 355 nm spectra of VO2- reveal a single
   vibrational progression for the ground state with a frequency of 970
   cm(-1) (nu(1)). Three electronic excited states are observed for VO2 in
   the 193 nm spectrum. For VO3-, three surprisingly sharp detachment
   transitions are observed at 193 nm, The two excited states of VO3 are
   measured to be 0.59 and 0.79 eV above the ground state. The spectra of
   VO2- and VO3 are interpreted using the molecular-orbital schemes
   obtained in a recent ab initio theoretical study {[}Knight, Jr, et al.,
   J. Chem. Phys. 105, 10237 (1996)], which predicts that both VO2 and VO3
   neutrals are of C-2 upsilon symmetry with a doublet ground state. The
   spectrum of VO4- is obtained at 193 nm, showing features similar to that
   of VO;, but much more broadened, The adiabatic electron affinities of
   VO, VO2, VO3, and VO4 are measured to be 1.229 (8), 2.03 (1), 4.36 (5),
   and 4.0 (1) eV, respectively, with a significant increase from VO2 to
   VO3. The electronic and geometrical structures of the series of

	Abstract = {The pure rotational spectra of VN (X-3 Delta(r)) and VO (X-4 Sigma(-))
   have been recorded in the frequency range 290-520 GHz using direct
   absorption spectroscopy. These radicals were synthesized in the
   gas-phase from the reaction Of VCl4 with either N-2 or H2O in an AC
   discharge. Seven rotational transitions were recorded for each molecule;
   in both sets of spectra, fine and hyperfine structures were resolved.
   The data sets for VN and VO were fit with Hund's case (a) and case (b)
   Hamiltonians, respectively, and rotational, fine structure, and
   hyperfine constants determined. For VN, however, an additional hyperfine
   parameter, Delta a, was necessary for the analysis of the Omega = 2
   sublevel to account for perturbations from a nearby (1)Delta state, in
   addition to the usual Frosch and Foley constants. Determination of Delta
   a suggests that the (1)Delta state lies similar to 3000 cm(-1) above the
   ground state. In VO, the hyperfine structure in the F-2 and F-3
   components was found to become heavily mixed due to an avoided crossing,
   predicted by previous optical studies to be near the N = 15 level. The
   hyperfine constants established for these two molecules are consistent
   with the proposed sigma(1)delta(1) and sigma(1)delta(2) electron
   configurations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The (0,0) band of the (BII)-I-4-X(4) Sigma(-) system of VO near 7900
   Angstrom has been analyzed from Doppler-limited Fourier transform
   emission spectra, together with wavelength-resolved laser-induced
   fluorescence and sub-Doppler intermodulated fluorescence spectra. The
   (BII)-I-4, v = 0 level is heavily perturbed by the a(2) Sigma(+), v = 2
   level. Because the 3d delta(2) 4s sigma a(2) Sigma(+) and 3d delta(2) 3d
   pi B4II states have very different hyperfine parameters, the hyperfine
   patterns of the rotational lines vary dramatically with J at the
   perturbations. The observed hyperfine structure of the band, including
   the lowest-J perturbation, near J = 381/2, could be explained in detail
   by a model Hamiltonian that takes the interactions into account: 3211
   hyperfine line frequencies have been fitted with an rms error of 11 MHz.
   The b parameter (the coefficient of I.S in the magnetic hyperfine
   Hamiltonian) is well determined for the a(2) Sigma(+) state and provides
   the evidence for its electron configuration. The hyperfine structure of
   the (BII)-I-4 state shows no effects of spin-orbit distortion and is
   well explained by the standard case (a(beta J)) model. Only the
   spin-orbit operator is needed to describe the interaction between the a
   and B states; the parameter for the direct dipolar interaction between
   them is too small to be determined. A fit to the higher-J rotational
   data showed that the spin-orbit interaction matrix element, which arises
   as a result of configuration interaction in the two states, has an
   apparent J dependence; this presumably means that the mixing is r
   dependent, Improved values for the ground state hyperfine parameters
   have been obtained from the new data, supplemented by the three very
   precise microwave frequencies measured by Suenram el al. (J. Mel.
   Spectrosc. 148, 114, 1991). (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

	Abstract = {We present transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b taken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectra cover the wavelength range 5808--6380 {\AA} with a resolving power of R= 5000. We detect absorption from the Na i doublet within the exoplanet's atmosphere at the 9σ confidence level within a 5 {\AA} band (absorption depth 0.09 $\pm$ 0.01 per cent) and use the data to measure the doublet's spectral absorption profile. We detect only the narrow cores of the doublet. The narrowness of the feature could be due to an obscuring high-altitude haze of an unknown composition or a significantly sub-solar Na i abundance hiding the line wings beneath an H2 Rayleigh signature. These observations are consistent with previous broad-band spectroscopy from Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and STIS, where a featureless spectrum was seen. We also investigate the effects of starspots on the Na i line profile, finding that their impact is minimal and within errors in the sodium feature.We compare the spectral absorption profile over 5.5 scale heights with model spectral absorption profiles and constrain the temperature at different atmospheric regions, allowing us to construct a vertical temperature profile. We identify two temperature regimes: a 1280 $\pm$ 240 K region derived from the Na i doublet line wings corresponding to altitudes below ∼500 km, and a 2800 $\pm$ 400 K region derived from the Na i doublet line cores corresponding to altitudes from ∼500 to 4000 km. The zero altitude is defined by the white-light radius of RP/R★= 0.15628 $\pm$ 0.00009. The temperature rises with altitude, which is likely evidence of a thermosphere.The absolute pressure scale depends on the species responsible for the Rayleigh signature and its abundance. We discuss a plausible scenario for this species, a high-altitude silicate haze and the atmospheric temperature--pressure profile that results. In this case, the high-altitude temperature rise for HD 189733b occurs at pressures of 10−5 to 10−8 bar.},

	Abstract = {We report Gemini-North Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph observations of the inflated hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b during two primary transits. We simultaneously observed two comparison stars and used differential spectrophotometry to produce multiwavelength light curves. `White' light curves and 29 `spectral' light curves were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the system parameters and produce transmission spectra from 520 to 930 nm in ≈14 nm bins. The light curves contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise, and we used a Gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. Common mode corrections derived from the white light-curve fits were applied to the spectral light curves which significantly improved our precision, reaching typical uncertainties in the transit depth of ∼2 × 10−4, corresponding to about half a pressure scale height. The low-resolution transmission spectra are consistent with a featureless model, and we can confidently rule out broad features larger than about one scale height. The absence of Na/K wings or prominent TiO/VO features is most easily explained by grey absorption from clouds in the upper atmosphere, masking the spectral features. However, we cannot confidently rule out clear atmosphere models with low abundances (∼10−3 solar) of TiO, VO or even metal hydrides masking the Na and K wings. A smaller scale height or ionization could also contribute to muted spectral features, but alone are unable to account for the absence of features reported here.},

	Abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is predicted to make great advances in the field of exoplanet atmospheres. Its 25 m2 mirror means that it can reach unprecedented levels of precision in observations of transit spectra, and can thus characterize the atmospheres of planets orbiting stars several hundred pc away. Its coverage of the infrared spectral region between 0.6 and 28 μm allows the abundances of key molecules to be probed during the transit of a planet in front of the host star, and when the same planet is eclipsed constraints can be placed on its temperature structure. In this work, we explore the possibility of using low-spectral-resolution observations by JWST/Near-Infrared Spectrograph and JWST/Mid-Infrared Instrumen-Low Resolution Spectrometer together to optimize wavelength coverage and break degeneracies in the atmospheric retrieval problem for a range of exoplanets from hot Jupiters to super-Earths. This approach involves stitching together non-simultaneous observations in different wavelength regions, rendering it necessary to consider the effect of time-varying instrumental and astrophysical systematics. We present the results of a series of retrieval feasibility tests examining the effects of instrument systematics and starspots on the recoverability of the true atmospheric state, and demonstrate that correcting for these systematics is key for successful exoplanet science with JWST.},

@article{04MaMiOw.VO,
	Abstract = {First-principles calculations of nondefective VO in the Fm (3) over barm
   structure based on a range of single-particle Hamiltonians containing
   varying amounts of exact exchange indicate that the ground electronic
   state is that of a d(3) high spin, antiferromagnetic (AF), Mott-Hubbard
   insulator with an AF(1) spin alignment of the local cation moments. This
   description remains essentially unchanged down to 10\% exact exchange,
   and only for the pure density functional theory (DFT) potential is the
   AF(1) phase found to be metallic. Strong spin-lattice interaction is
   predicted with differences in lattice constant of up to 1.6\% between
   AF(1) and FM (ferromagnetic) order. The AF(1) lattice constant is
   predicted to be similar to4.37 Angstrom, which is roughly 7\% greater
   than the reported lattice constants for the defective material. The bulk
   modulus is comparable to those of CaO, MnO, and NiO. A mapping of total
   energies onto an Ising spin Hamiltonian containing both direct and
   superexchange interactions reveals the dominant magnetic interaction to
   be the direct coupling of antiferromagnetically aligned nearest-neighbor
   cation spins, which leads to the stability of the AF(1) phase. Direct
   coupling energies are found in the range -11.1 to -44.3 meV as the
   proportion of exact exchange is reduced, leading to an estimated
   critical disorder temperature in the range 300-450 K. However, the
   limitations of such mapping are exposed by a consideration of the
   relative stabilities of the AF(1) and AF(3) alignments. Orbital
   projected densities of states reveal filled to unfilled gaps which
   depend strongly on the proportion of exact exchange and for the B3LYP
   potential (20\% exact exchange) are similar to2.5 eV for the
   spin-forbidden xy(up arrow)-->xy(down arrow) excitation, similar to3.0
   eV for xy(up arrow)-->z(2)(up arrow), and similar to3.5 eV for V-->O
   charge transfer. Variationally stable, highly local crystal-field
   excited states ranging in energy from similar to0.6 to similar to2.7 eV
   are predicted for exchange-correlation potentials down to 30\% exact
   exchange and from comparisons with the corresponding band excitation
   estimates of similar to1 to similar to2 eV are obtained for the
   localization energy of Frenkel excitons. From a mapping of the excited
   crystal-field energies onto a Kanamori Hamiltonian, values are obtained
   for the lattice Racah B and C parameters and the d-orbital averaged
   exchange and crystal-field energies. A comparison of mapped and directly
   calculated energies of the two-electron excitation
   (xz,yz)-->(z(2),x(2)-y(2)) confirms the validity of Kanamori mapping,
   notably in the limit of exact exchange.},

   metal (except La) monoxides and their positively and negatively charged
   ions were studied by use of density functional methods B3LYP, BLYP,
   B3PW91, BPW91, B3P86, BP86, MPW1PW91, PBE1PBE, and SVWN. Our calculation
   shows that for each individual species, the calculated properties are
   quite sensitive to the method used. Compared with hybrid density
   functional method B3PW91 (B3P86), pure density functional method BPW91
   (BP86) gives longer bond distance (lower vibrational frequency) from HfO
   to PtO for neutral species, HfO+ to IrO+ for cationic species, and HfO-
   to AuO- for anionic species. While for B3LYP and BLYP, the trend was
   observed for cationic species from HfO+ to IrO+ and anionic species from
   HfO- to AuO- (except TaO-), but not for neutrals. Pure density function
   methods BLYP, BPW91, and BP86 give larger dissociation energy compared
   with hybrid density functional methods B3LYP, B3PW91, and B3P86. SVWN in
   most cases gives the smallest bond distance, while BLYP gives the
   largest value. MPW1PW91 and PBE1PBE show the same performance in
   predicting the spectroscopic constants. In addition, useful empirical
   criteria that one has obtained the ground states of a species and its
   ions are the spin multiplicities of a neutral and its single charged
   ions which differs by +/- 1.},

@article{95BaMaxx.VO,
	Abstract = {The first transition row oxides and sulfides are studied using several
   different levels of theory. The calculations show the bonding mechanism
   in the sulfides and oxides to be very similar. For the oxides, accurate
   experimental data anew the theoretical methods to be calibrated. The
   same level of theory is used to study the sulfides where there is far
   less experimental information. For ScO through MnO and CuO the coupled
   cluster singles and doubles technique including a perturbational
   estimate of the connected triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)] yields
   spectroscopic constants (r(c), omega(c), and D-o) in good agreement with
   experiment. The triple excitations are found to be very important in
   achieving this accuracy. For FeO to NiO, the self-consistent-field (SCF)
   approach yields pi. orbitals that are localized on the metal or oxygen.
   This appears to cause problems for the single reference techniques; this
   is discussed in detail for NiO. The complete-active-space SCF/internally
   contracted averaged coupled pair functional approach (CASSCF/ICACPF)
   works well for FeO to NiO. The calculation of accurate dipole moments is
   found to be very difficult.},
