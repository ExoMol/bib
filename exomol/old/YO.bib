Abstract = {V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon) erupted at the beginning of 2002 becoming an
   extremely luminous star with L similar or equal to 10(6)L(circle dot) .
   Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the outburst,
   the most promising is a stellar merger event. In this paper, we
   investigate the observational properties of the star and its
   surroundings in the post outburst phase. We have obtained a
   high-resolution optical spectrum of V838 Mon in 2005 October using the
   Keck I telescope. We have identified numerous atomic features and
   molecular bands present in the spectrum and provided an atlas of those
   features. In order to improve the spectrum interpretation, we have
   performed simple modeling of the molecular bands. Our analysis indicates
   that the spectrum is dominated by molecular absorption features arising
   in photospheric regions with temperatures of similar to 2400 K and in
   colder outer layers, where the temperature decreases to similar to 500
   K. A number of resonance lines of neutral alkali metals are observed to
   show P Cygni profiles. Particularly interesting are numerous prominent
   emission lines of {[}Fe II]. All of them show practically the same
   profile, which can be well described by a Lorentzian profile. In the
   blue part of the spectrum, photospheric signatures of the B-type
   companion are easily seen. We have fitted the observed spectrum with a
   synthetic one and the obtained parameters are consistent with the B3V
   type. We have also estimated radial and rotational velocities of the
   companion.},

   on these same species with a reference beam using the sun radiation as
   source. These coupled techniques led to consistent results and suggested

Abstract = {We analyze spectra of V838 Mon and V4332 Sgr taken in 2004-2005 using
   the 6 m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory with the UAGS
   and SCORPIO spectrographs; the spectra have a resolution of 4.6 angstrom
   and a high signal-to-noise ratio. We confirm that V838 Mon is a spectral
   binary containing a B3V star and cool oxygen-rich star. We identify AlO,
   TiO, VO, ScO, BaO, ZrO, and YO molecular bands in the cool star's
   spectrum. The TiO absorption band at lambda 4423 angstrom overlaps the
   continuum of the hot B3V star, testifying that the hot star and its cool
   companion form a wide physical pair. Further evidence for the
   components' interaction is the presence of forbidden {[}Fell] lines that
   become stronger in the blue. We detected significant spectral
   variability of the cool star during 10 months in 2004. The spectrum of
   V4332 Sgr in 2005 (11 years after the outburst) contains emission lines
   of neutral metal atoms and of metal oxides against a photospheric
   continuum with a blackbody temperature of 2700 K. We identify the AlI,
   CaI, CrI, MnI, and SrI resonance lines and molecular emission lines of
   AlO, TiO, and VO, along with numerous emission lines of CrI in the
   spectrum. The MgI lambda 4571 angstrom intercombination line is present.
   The emission lines are formed in a large volume of cool low-density gas.
   We conclude based on spectroscopy combined with archive photographs and
   modern CCD photometry that both peculiar red novae were binaries prior
   to their outbursts, and contained blue hot components that exploded. The
   secondary of V838 Mon is a hot B3V star, and that of V4332 Sgr is a cool
   M7 star.},

Abstract = {A spectroscopic study of the Rydberg states of YO accessed from
   particular rotational levels of the A (2)Pi(1/2), v=0 state has been
   combined with a pulsed field ionization, zero electron kinetic energy
   (PFI-ZEKE) investigation. The results provide accurate values of the
   ionization energy of YO, ionization energy I.E.(YO)=49 304.316(31)
   cm(-1) {[}6.112 958(4) eV], and of the rotational constant (and bond
   length) of the YO+ cation in its X (1)Sigma(+), v=0 ground state,
   B-0(+)=0.4078(3) cm(-1) {[}r(0)=1.7463(6) Angstrom]. The improved value
   of I.E.(YO) combined with the known ionization energy of atomic yttrium
   then leads to the result D-0(0)(Y-O)-D-0(0)(Y-O)=0.1041 +/- 0.0001 eV.
   Combining this result with the value of D-0(0)(Y+-O) obtained from
   guided ion beam mass spectrometry yields an improved value of
   D-0(0)(Y-O)=7.14 +/- 0.18 eV. The PFI-ZEKE spectra display an
   interesting channel-coupling effect so that all rotational levels with
   J(+)less than or equal to J(')(A)+0.5 are observed with high intensity,
   where J(+) is the angular momentum of the YO+ cation that is produced
   and J(')(A) is the angular momentum of the A (2)Pi(1/2) state that is
   reached when the first photon is absorbed. This is thought to result
   from the interaction between the dipole moment of the rotating YO+ core
   and the Rydberg electron, which can induce changes in l and J(+) subject
   to the dipolar coupling matrix element selection rule, Delta J(+)=+/- 1,
   Delta l=+/- 1. The channel-coupling mechanism also appears to induce an
   inverse autoionization process in which an unbound electron with a low
   value of l is captured either by its low-J(+) YO+ cation or by a second
   YO+ cation with the same value of J(+). This inverse autoionization
   process is extremely sensitive to the electron kinetic energy, leading
   to narrow peaks in the PFI-ZEKE spectrum which are only slightly broader
   than the laser linewidth employed for this study (0.25 cm(-1)). (C) 1999

   electronic states. These metal oxide radicals were generated by the
   pulsed-laser vaporization of the metals in the presence of
   O-16(2)/O-17(2) and trapped in neon and argon matrices for electron spin
   resonance investigations. The fully resolved A tensors of the metal and
   O-17 were compared with ab initio theoretical calculations-a comparison
   previously reported only for the ScO radical. The computational methods
   employed were unrestricted Hartree-Fock, density functional theory
   (DFT), and restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock. Having the metal and O-17
   hyperfine interactions available has permitted a more thorough
   description of the electronic structure and charge distribution in these
   metal oxide molecules. An electronic structure comparison with the AlO,
   GaO, and InO radicals has also been made. Reasonably good agreement
   between the observed and calculated values of A iso and A dip were
   achieved with the DFT method providing the closest agreement. (C) 1999

Abstract = {A spatially and temporally resolved transient absorption technique has
   been employed to investigate the dynamics of ground-state YO during 355
   nm laser ablation of Y2O3. Time-of-Eight (TOF) measurements of the
   expanding YO plume in vacuum and in Ar or O-2 ambient are reported.
   During the initial expansion of YO in vacuum, the center-of-mass
   velocity and the expansion velocity increase with distance up to the
   boundary of the Knudsen layer. In the presence of oxygen, reactions of
   the ablated atomic species with oxygen take place, resulting in the
   formation of YO with broad velocity distribution. From the peak time of
   the observed TOF distributions, the most probable velocities of YO are
   found to be 2.6 km/s in vacuum, 2.2 km/s in 50 mTorr Ar, and 1.8 km/s in
   50 mTorr O-2, respectively. The dependence of the peak time on distance
   shows that the experimental data can be well fitted with a shock wave
   model at higher ambient gas pressure.},

   hardcopy text is accompanied by an electronic archive, stored on the SAE
   homepage at http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/sabe. The archive contains
   data files and text files. The present article is the fourth part of a
   series of papers discussing the spectral interferences of rare earth
   elements (REEs) in inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
   spectrometry (ICP-AES). The spectral interferences for 200-pm wide
   windows centred (+/- 100 pm) around the prominent lines of the analytes,
   due to matrix lines and oxide radicals (LuO or YO) that emit band
   spectra depending on the excitation temperature (T-exc.) in ICP were
   investigated. The main result is that for T-exc. = 7200 K, LuO and YO
   band components can be eliminated so that prominent analysis lines of
   La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu and Sm were observed on at smooth background. T-exc..
   = 7200 K was chosen as the optimal excitation temperature in the
   determination of traces of REEs in Lu2O3 and Y2O3. respectively. The
   quantification of the interferences in terms of e-value was used in
   accordance with Boumans and Vrakking {[}Spectrochimica Acta Part B 42
   (1987) 819; 43 (1188) 69]. The ``best'' analysis lines are free of line
   interferences and negligibly influenced by wing interferences and Lu2O3
   and Y2O3 as matrices do not raise the real detection limits. (C) 1998

Abstract = {The first simultaneous measurements of the ground-state translational,
   rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of a laser ablated
   diatomic molecule (YO) liberated during a 351 nm excimer laser ablation
   of YBa2Cu3O7-delta, are reported. In addition, the translational energy
   distributions of Y, Y+, Ba, Ba+, and Cu are reported. Measurements made
   at low and high fluences on YO indicate that there are very large
   differences in the `'temperatures'' inferred between the translational
   and the vibrational/rotational energy channels, implying that energy is
   partitioned in a very nonequilibrium fashion in the expanding plume. A
   measurement of the rotational and vibrational temperatures shows that
   the internal degrees of freedom are equilibrated in the expansion plume
   (Boltzmann distributions) with a temperature of approximately 1000 K
   being observed at normal processing fluences. The translational energy
   distributions of YO are observed to fit a shifted Boltzmann distribution
   at high fluences. The atomic species monitored all display non-Boltzmann
   velocity distributions at high fluences. The peak of the observed
   velocity distributions corresponds to energies as high as 10 eV for the
   YO neutral diatomic and up to several hundred eV for Ba+ at ablation
   fluences of 5 J/cm2. Bimodal velocity distributions are observed for the
   Cu, Ba, and Y neutral atoms at high incident fluences, implying
   ion-electron recombination as a partial source of the high neutral
   velocities.},

Abstract = {Deposits given by condensing resistively heated yttrium metal into
   cyclohexane and adamantane matrices under high vacuum and at 77 K on a

   aramagnetic products under these conditions are YO in at least two
   distinct trapping sites and yttrium clusters, Y(n), where n = 5 or 7.
   Analysis of the yttrium hyperfine interaction for YO indicates that the
   unpaired electron has 60\% metal 5s character with the remainder of the
   unpaired spin in oxygen, matrix and metal p and 4d orbitals.  An yttrium
   cluster, Y(n), is produced in adamantane that is tumbling freely or
   pseudorotating above 205 K and has ca. 10\% unpaired spin in the Y 5s
   orbital with the rest pressumed to be in metal 4d orbitals.  A different
   Y cluster is formed in cyclohexane that could be a rigid pentemer or
   septemer with a trigonal bipyamidal or pentagonal bipyramidal structure.
   It is tentatively suggested that Y5 is formed in adamantane and that Y7
   is formed in cyclohexane.},

Abstract = {The optical Stark effect in the (0, 0) A(2)Pi-X(2)Sigma(+) band systems
   of a yttrium monosulfide, YS, supersonic molecular beam sample have been
   analyzed to produce the magnitude of the permanent electric dipole
   moments, \textbackslash{}mu\textbackslash{}, for the
   A(2)Pi(3/2)-X(2)Sigma(+) and A(2)Pi(1/2)-X(2)Sigma(+) states of 5.9(2),
   and 6.8(1) D, respectively. Small splittings in the field free
   A(2)Pi(3/2)-X(2)Sigma(+) and A(2)Pi(1/2)-X(2)Sigma(+) spectra were
   analyzed to produce the magnetic hyperfine spectroscopic parameters a =
   -36(6), c = 111(7), and d = -107 (6) MHz for the A(2)Pi state.
   Transition frequencies of the low rotational lines in the (0,0)
   A(2)Pi(r)-X(2)Sigma(+) band system were measured and analyzed to produce
   the first complete set of fine structure parameters for the A(2)Pi(r)
   state. A comparison with YO and other isovalent molecules is made. (C)
