  abstract = {The application of the coupled cluster method restricted to single
	and double excitations (CCSD) to a non-Hartree-Fock determinantal
	reference wavefunction is examined, with particular emphasis on the
	case of spin-restricted open shell reference states. By considering
	the perturbation expansions of the true and CCSD energies, expressions
	are derived which give a perturbative correction for the effects
	of triple excitations which is consistent to fifth order. The resulting
	Ansatz, denoted CCSD-T, differs from the standard CCSD(T) correction
	even in the case where Brillouin's theorem holds, and ought to be
	superior, since it correctly includes more disconnected triples terms
	up to fifth order. This assertion is investigated by test calculations,
	which show that both methods deliver accurate results for both closed
	and open shell molecules.},

  pages = {9244},
  abstract = {{For molecules containing second row atoms, unacceptable errors have
	been found in extrapolating dissociation energies calculated with
	the standard correlation consistent basis sets to the complete basis
	set limit. By carefully comparing the convergence behavior of De(O2)
	and De(SO), we show that the cause of these errors is a result of
	two inter-related problems: near duplication of the exponents in
	two of the d sets and a lack of high-exponent functions in the early
	members of the sets. Similar problems exist for the f sets (and probably
	in higher angular momentum sets), but have only a minor effect on
	the calculated dissociation energies. A number of approaches to address
	the problems in the d sets were investigated. Well behaved convergence
	was obtained by augmenting the (1d) and (2d) sets with a high-exponent
	function and by replacing the (3d) set by the (4d) set and the (4d)
	set by the (5d) set and so on. To ensure satisfactory coverage of
	both the L and M shell regions, the exponents of the new d sets were
	re-optimized. Benchmark calculations on Si2, PN, SO, and AlCl with
	the new cc-pV(n+d)Z sets show greatly improved convergence behavior
	not only for De but for many other properties as well. © 2001 American

Title = {{Conformers of Gaseous Cysteine}},
Journal = {J. Comput. Chem. Theory},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {1511-1523},
Abstract = {{Structures, accurate relative energies, equilibrium and vibrationally
   averaged rotational constants, quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion
   constants, dipole moments, N-14 nuclear quadrupole coupling constants,
   anharmonic vibrational frequencies, and double-harmonic infrared
   intensities have been determined from ab initio electronic structure
   computations for conformers of the neutral form of the natural amino
   acid L-cysteine (Cys). A systematic scan located 71 unique conformers of
   Cys using the MP2(FC)/cc-pVTZ method. The large number of structurally
   diverse low-energy conformers of Cys necessitates the highest possible
   levels of electronic structure theory to determine their relative
   energies with some certainty. For this reason, we determined the
   relative energies of the lowest-energy eleven conformers, accurate
   within a standard error (11 or) of about 0.3 kJ mol(-1), through
   first-principles composite focal-point analyses (FPA), which employed
   extrapolations using basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z and
   correlation treatments as extensive as CCSD(T). Three and eleven
   conformers Of L-cysteine fall within a relative energy of 6 and 10 kJ
   mol(-1), respectively. The vibrationally averaged rotational constants
   computed in this study agree well with Fourier-transform microwave
   spectroscopy results. The effects determining the relative energies of
   the low-energy conformers of cysteine are analyzed in detail on the
   basis of hydrogen bond additivity schemes and natural bond orbital
   analysis.}},
