Abstract = {We present an analysis of the 0.95-14.5 mu m spectral energy
   distributions of nine field ultracool dwarfs with spectral types ranging
   from L1 to T4.5. Effective temperatures, gravities, and condensate cloud
   sedimentation efficiencies are derived by comparing the data to
   synthetic spectra computed from atmospheric models that
   self-consistently include the formation of condensate clouds. Overall,
   the model spectra fit the data well, although the agreement at some
   wavelengths remains poor due to remaining inadequacies in the models.
   Derived effective temperatures decrease steadily through the L1-T4.5
   spectral types, and we confirm that the effective temperatures of
   ultracool dwarfs at the L/T transition are nearly constant, decreasing
   by only similar to 200 K from spectral types L7.5 to T4.5. The
   condensate cloud properties vary significantly among the L dwarfs in our
   sample, ranging from very thick clouds to relatively thin clouds with no
   particular trend with spectral type. The two objects in our sample with
   very red J - K(s) colors are, however, best fitted with synthetic
   spectra that have thick clouds, which hints at a possible correlation
   between the near-infrared colors of L dwarfs and the condensate cloud
   properties. The fits to the two T dwarfs in our sample (T2 and T4.5)
   also suggest that the clouds become thinner in this spectral class, in
   agreement with previous studies. Restricting the fits to narrower
   wavelength ranges (i.e., individual photometric bands) almost always
   yields excellent agreement between the data and models. Limitations in
   our knowledge of the opacities of key absorbers such as FeH, VO, and
   CH(4) at certain wavelengths remain obvious, however. The effective
   temperatures obtained by fitting the narrower wavelength ranges can show
   a large scatter compared to the values derived by fitting the full
   spectral energy distributions; deviations are typically similar to 200 K
   and, in the worst cases, up to 700 K.},

   The equivalent widths of the refractory atomic features all decrease with increasing spectral type and are
   absent by a spectral type of ~L0, except for the 1.189 μm Fe I line, which persists to at least ~L3.

   and Na I doublets; narrow Cs I and Rb I lines; weak CaH, CrH, and FeH
   bands; strong H(2)O absorption; and a possible weak CH(4) band. Halpha

   reported active T dwarf 2MASS 1237+6526 and weak in SDSS 1254-0122 and
   2MASS 1047+2124. None of the T dwarfs exhibit Li I absorption. Guided by
   the evolution of optical spectral features with near-infrared spectral
   type, we derive a parallel optical classification scheme, focusing on
   spectral types T5 to T8, anchored to select spectral standards. We find
   general agreement between optical and near-infrared types for nearly all
   the T dwarfs so far observed, including two earlier type T dwarfs,
   within our classification uncertainties (similar to1 subtype). These
   results suggest that competing gravity and temperature effects
   compensate for each other over the 0.6-2.5 mum spectral region. We
   identify one possible means of disentangling these effects by comparing
   the strength of the K I red wing to the 9250 Angstrom H(2)O band. One of
   our objects, 2MASS 0937+2931, exhibits a peculiar spectrum with a
   substantial red slope and relatively strong FeH absorption, both
   consequences of a metal-deficient atmosphere. On the basis of its
   near-infrared properties and substantial space motion, this object may
   be a thick disk or halo brown dwarf.},

Abstract = {We study the abundances of complex carbon-bearing molecules in the

   drift-phoenix atmosphere simulations, which include the feedback of

   and the gas-phase abundances, are utilized. The resulting element
   depletion leads to a shift in the carbon-to-oxygen ratio such that
   several hydrocarbon molecules and cyanopolyyne molecules can be present.
   An increase in surface gravity and/or a decrease in metallicity support
   the increase in the partial pressures of these species. CO, CO2, CH4 and
   HCN contain the largest fraction of carbon. In the upper atmosphere of
   low-metallicity objects, more carbon is contained in C4H than in CO, and

   the upper atmospheres not only of giant gas planets, but also of brown

Abstract = {The discovery of a new spectral class - the Y dwarfs - by NASA's
   Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer has enabled researchers to study the
   physics of the coldest brown dwarfs and to determine the prevalence of
   brown dwarfs in the Milky Way. The boundary between T dwarfs and Y
   dwarfs roughly coincides with the location where the J - H colors of
   brown dwarfs, as predicted by models, turn back to the red at effective
   temperatures below similar to 400 K. Preliminary trigonometric parallax
   measurements show that the T/Y boundary appears also to correspond to
   the point at which the absolute H (1.6 mu m) and W2 (4.6 mu m)
   magnitudes plummet. Using these new distance measurements, it is found
   that hydrogen-burning stars outnumber brown dwarfs by approximately a
   factor of six in the solar neighborhood. Using simulations describing
   the mass function as a power law or as a lognormal, we find that both
   the shape and predicted space densities in the mid-T to early-Y regime
   can be fit only if these functions are normalized downward to better
   reflect the relative paucity of brown dwarfs. The sample of currently
   identified Y dwarfs probes the field mass function to masses of similar
   to 5 MJup, but confirmation of additional, colder Y dwarfs from WISE is
   needed to determine whether the low-mass limit to star formation has yet
   been measured. (C) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

Abstract = {{Using a model for refractory clouds, a novel algorithm for handling
   them, and the latest gas-phase molecular opacities, we have produced a
   new series of L and T dwarf spectral and atmosphere models as a function
   of gravity and metallicity, spanning the T-eff range from 2200 to 700 K.
   The correspondence with observed spectra and infrared colors for early
   and mid-L dwarfs and for mid-to late T dwarfs is good. We find that the
   width in infrared color-magnitude diagrams of both the T and L dwarf
   branches is naturally explained by reasonable variations in gravity and
   therefore that gravity is the ``second parameter'' of the L-T dwarf
   sequence. We investigate the dependence of theoretical dwarf spectra and
   color-magnitude diagrams on various cloud properties, such as particle
   size and cloud spatial distribution. In the region of the L -> T
   transition, we find that no single combination of cloud particle size
   and gravity can be made to fit all the observed data. Our results
   suggest that current ignorance of detailed cloud meteorology renders
   ambiguous the extraction of various physical quantities such as Teff and
   gravity for mid-L to early T dwarfs. Nevertheless, for decreasing Teff,
   we capture with some accuracy the major spectral features and signatures
   observed. We speculate that the subdwarf branch of the L dwarfs would be
   narrower in effective temperature and that for low enough metallicity
   the L dwarfs would disappear altogether as a spectroscopic class.
   Furthermore, we note that the new, lower solar oxygen abundances of
   Allende-Prieto and coworkers produce better fits to brown dwarf data
   than do the older values. Finally, we discuss various issues in cloud
   physics and modeling and speculate on how a better correspondence
   between theory and observation in the problematic L -> T transition
   region could be achieved.}},

Abstract = {A revised near-infrared classification scheme for T dwarfs is presented,
   based on and superseding prior schemes developed by Burgasser and
   coworkers and Geballe and coworkers, and defined following the precepts
   of the MK process. Drawing from two large spectroscopic libraries of T
   dwarfs identified largely in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two
   Micron All Sky Survey, nine primary spectral standards and five
   alternate standards spanning spectral types T0-T8 are identified that
   match criteria of spectral character, brightness, absence of a resolved
   companion, and accessibility from both the Northern and Southern
   Hemispheres. The classification of T dwarfs is formally made by the
   direct comparison of near-infrared spectral data of equivalent
   resolution to the spectra of these standards. Alternately, we have
   redefined five key spectral indices measuring the strengths of the major
   H(2)O and CH(4) bands in the 1-2.5 mu m region that may be used as a
   proxy to direct spectral comparison. Two methods of determining T
   spectral type using these indices are outlined and yield equivalent
   results. These classifications are also equivalent to those from prior
   schemes, implying that no revision of existing spectral type trends is
   required. The one-dimensional scheme presented here provides a first
   step toward the observational characterization of the lowest luminosity
   brown dwarfs currently known. Future extensions to incorporate spectral
   variations arising from differences in photospheric dust content,
   gravity, and metallicity are briefly discussed. A compendium of all
   currently known T dwarfs with updated classifications is presented.},

Abstract = {The establishment of new spectral classes cooler than type M has had a
   brief, yet already rich, history. Prototypes of the new ``L dwarf{''}

   mid-1990s, with a flood of new discoveries occurring in the late 1990s

   hundred and fifty L and T dwarfs are now cataloged. This review
   concentrates on the spectroscopic properties of these objects, beginning
   with the establishment of classification schemes rooted in the MK
   Process. The resulting grid of spectral types is then used as a tool to
   ferret out the underlying physics. The temperature ranges covered by
   these spectral types, the complex chemical processes responsible for the
   shape of their emergent spectra, their nature as either true stars or
   brown dwarfs, and their number density in the Galaxy are discussed. Two
   promising avenues for future research are also explored: the extension
   of the classification system to three dimensions to account for gravity-
   and metallicity-dependent features, and the capability of newer
   large-area surveys to uncover brown dwarfs cooler than those now

Abstract = {We present the discovery of seven ultracool brown dwarfs identified with
   the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Near-infrared
   spectroscopy reveals deep absorption bands of H2O and CH4 that indicate
   all seven of the brown dwarfs have spectral types later than UGPS
   J072227.51-054031.2, the latest-type T dwarf currently known. The
   spectrum of WISEP J182831.08+ 265037.8 is distinct in that the heights
   of the J- and H-band peaks are approximately equal in units of f lambda,
   so we identify it as the archetypal member of the Y spectral class. The
   spectra of at least two of the other brown dwarfs exhibit absorption on
   the blue wing of the H-band peak that we tentatively ascribe to NH3.
   These spectral morphological changes provide a clear transition between
   the T dwarfs and the Y dwarfs. In order to produce a smooth
   near-infrared spectral sequence across the T/Y dwarf transition, we have
   reclassified UGPS 0722-05 as the T9 spectral standard and tentatively
   assign WISEP J173835.52+ 273258.9 as the Y0 spectral standard. In total,
   six of the seven new brown dwarfs are classified as Y dwarfs: four are
   classified as Y0, one is classified as Y0 (pec?), and WISEP J1828+ 2650
   is classified as > Y0. We have also compared the spectra to the model
   atmospheres of Marley and Saumon and infer that the brown dwarfs have
   effective temperatures ranging from 300 K to 500 K, making them the
   coldest spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs known to date.},

Abstract = {We present a spectrum of the cool (T(eff) = 900 K) brown dwarf Gliese
   229B. This spectrum, with a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio per
   spectral resolution element (greater than or similar to 30), spans the
   wavelength range from 0.837 mu m to 5.0 mu m. We identify a total of
   four different major methane absorption features, including the
   fundamental band at 3.3 mu m, at least four steam bands, and two neutral
   cesium features. We confirm the recent detection of carbon monoxide (CO)
   in excess of what is predicted by thermochemical equilibrium
   calculations. Carbon is primarily involved in a chemical balance between
   methane and CO at the temperatures and pressures present in the outer
   parts of a brown dwarf. At lower temperatures, the balance favors
   methane, while in the deeper, hotter regions, the reaction reverses to
   convert methane into CO. The presence of CO in the observable part of
   the atmosphere is therefore a sensitive indicator of vertical flows. The
   high signal-to-noise ratio in the 1 mu m to 2.5 mu m region permits us
   to place constraints on the quantity of dust in the atmosphere of the
   brown dwarf. We are unable to reconcile the observed spectrum with
   synthetic spectra that include the presences of dust. The presence of CO
   but lack of dust may be a clue to the location of the boundaries of the
   outer convective region of the atmosphere: The lack of dust may mean
   that it is not being conveyed into the photosphere by convection, or
   that it exists in patchy clouds. If the dust is not in clouds, but
   rather sits below the outer convective region, we estimate that the
   boundary between outer convective and inner radiative layers is between
   1250 K and 1600 K, in agreement with recent models.},

Abstract = {We present new 5.2-14.5 mu m low-resolution spectra of 14 mid-L to mid-T
   dwarfs. We also present new 3.0-4.1 mu m spectra for five of these
   dwarfs. These data are supplemented by existing red and near-infrared
   spectra (similar to 0.6-2.5 mu m), as well as red through mid-infrared
   spectroscopy of seven other L and T dwarfs presented by Cushing et al.
   We compare these spectra to those generated from the model atmospheres
   of Saumon \& Marley. The models reproduce the observed spectra well,
   except in the case of one very red L3.5 dwarf, 2MASS J22244381-0158521.
   The broad wavelength coverage allows us to constrain almost
   independently the four parameters used to describe these photospheres in
   our models: effective temperature (T(eff)), surface gravity, grain
   sedimentation efficiency (f(sed)), and vertical gas transport efficiency
   (K(zz)). The CH(4) bands centered at 2.2, 3.3, and 7.65 mu m and the CO
   band at 2.3 mu m are sensitive to K(zz), and indicates that chemical
   mixing is important in all L and T dwarf atmospheres. The sample of L3.5
   to T5.5 dwarfs spans the range 1800 K greater than or similar to T(eff)
   greater than or similar to 1000 K, with an L-T transition (spectral
   types L7 to T4) that lies between 1400 and 1100 K for dwarfs with
   typical near-infrared colors; bluer and redder dwarfs can be 100 K
   warmer or cooler, respectively, when using infrared spectral types. When
   using optical spectral types, the bluer dwarfs have more typical T(eff)
   values as they tend to have earlier optical spectral types. In this
   model analysis, f(sed) increases rapidly between types T0 and T4,
   indicating that increased sedimentation can explain the rapid
   disappearance of clouds at this stage of brown dwarf evolution. There is
   a suggestion that the transition to dust-free atmospheres happens at
   lower temperatures for lower gravity dwarfs.},

Abstract = {Aims. We determine the effective temperature, surface gravity and
   projected rotational velocity of nine T dwarfs from the comparison of
   high-resolution near-infrared spectra and synthetic models, and estimate
   the mass and age of the objects from state-of-the-art models.
   Methods. We use the AMES-COND cloudless solar metallicity models
   provided by the PHOENIX code to match the spectra of nine T-type field
   dwarfs observed with the near-infrared high-resolution spectrograph
   NIRSPEC using ten echelle orders to cover part of the J band from 1.147
   to 1.347 mu m with a resolving power R similar to 20 000. The projected
   rotational velocity, effective temperature and surface gravity of the
   objects are determined based on the minimum root mean square of the
   differences between the modelled and observed relative fluxes. Estimates
   of the mass and age of the objects are obtained from effective
   temperature-surface gravity diagrams, where our results are compared
   with existing solar metallicity models.
   Results. The modelled spectra reproduce quite well the observed features
   for most of the T dwarfs, with effective temperatures in the range of
   922-1009 K, and surface gravities between 10(4.1) and 10(4.9) cm s(-2).
   Our results support the assumption of a dust free atmosphere for T
   dwarfs later than T5, where dust grains form and then gravitationally
   sediment into the low atmosphere. The modelled spectra do not accurately
   mimic some individual very strong lines like the Ki doublet at 1.2436
   and 1.2525 mu m. Our modelled spectra does not match well the observed
   spectra of the two T dwarfs with earlier spectral types, namely SDSSp
   J125453.90-012247.4 (T2) and 2MASS J05591914-1404488 (T4.5), which is
   likely due to the presence of condensate clouds that are not
   incorporated in the models used here. By comparing our results and their
   uncertainties to evolutionary models, we estimate masses in the interval
   approximate to 5-75 M(J) for T dwarfs later than T5, which are in good
   agreement with those found in the literature. We found apparent young
   ages that are typically between 0.1 and a few Gyr for the same T dwarfs,
   which is consistent with recent kinematical studies.},

Abstract = {We report the discovery of a very cool, isolated brown dwarf, UGPS
   0722-05, with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Deep Sky Survey
   (UKIDSS) Galactic Plane Survey. The near-infrared spectrum displays
   deeper H2O and CH4 troughs than the coolest known T dwarfs and an
   unidentified absorption feature at 1.275 mu m. We provisionally classify
   the object as a T10 dwarf but note that it may in future come to be
   regarded as the first example of a new spectral type. The distance is
   measured by trigonometric parallax as d = 4.1(-0.5)(+0.6) pc, making it
   the closest known isolated brown dwarf. With the aid of Spitzer/Infrared
   Array Camera (IRAC) we measure H - {[}4.5] = 4.71. It is the coolest
   brown dwarf presently known - the only known T dwarf that is redder in H
   - {[}4.5] is the peculiar T7.5 dwarf SDSS J1416+13B, which is thought to
   be warmer and more luminous than UGPS 0722-05. Our measurement of the
   luminosity, aided by Gemini/T-ReCS N-band photometry, is L = 9.2 +/- 3.1
   x 10(-7) L-circle dot. Using a comparison with well-studied T8.5 and T9
   dwarfs we deduce T-eff = 520 +/- 40 K. This is supported by predictions
   of the Saumon \& Marley models. With apparent magnitude J = 16.52, UGPS
   0722-05 is the brightest of the similar to 90 T dwarfs discovered by
   UKIDSS so far. It offers opportunities for future study via
   high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy and spectroscopy in the
   thermal infrared.},
