  abstract = {Among the hot Jupiters known to date that transit their parent stars,
	the two best candidates to be observed with transmission spectroscopy
	in the mid-infrared (MIR) are HD 189733b and HD 209458b, due to their
	combined characteristics of planetary density, orbital parameters,
	and parent star distance and brightness. Here we simulate transmission
	spectra of these two planets during their primary transit in the
	MIR, and we present sensitivity studies of the spectra to the changes
	of atmospheric thermal properties, molecular abundances, and C/O
	ratios. Our model predicts that the dominant species absorbing in
	the MIR on hot Jupiters are water vapor and carbon monoxide, and
	their relative abundances are determined by the C/O ratio. Since
	the temperature profile plays a secondary role in the transmission
	spectra of hot Jupiters compared to molecular abundances, future
	primary transit observations in the MIR of those objects might offer
	insight on extrasolar giant planet atmospheric chemistry. We find
	here that the absorption features caused by water vapor and carbon
	monoxide in a cloud-free atmosphere are deep enough to be observable
	by the present and future generation of space-based observatories,
	such as Spitzer Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. We
	discuss our results in light of the capabilities of these telescopes.},

	the inverse problem. The development of a suite of radiative transfer
	and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is described, building
	upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the study

	the best-fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets

	Over the altitudes probed by the contribution functions, the retrieved
	thermal structure shows an isothermal upper atmosphere overlying
	a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature decreasing with altitude),

  title = {C/O RATIO AS A DIMENSION FOR CHARACTERIZING EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES},
  journal = ApJ,
  year = {2012},
  volume = {758},
  abstract = {Until recently, infrared observations of exoplanetary atmospheres
	have typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental
	abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been
	made to classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar
	irradiation. However, recent observations have revealed deviations
	from predictions based on such classification schemes, and chemical
	compositions retrieved from some data sets have also indicated non-solar
	abundances. The data require a two-dimensional (2D) characterization
	scheme with dependence on both irradiation and chemistry. In this
	work, we suggest the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as an important
	second dimension for characterizing exoplanetary atmospheres. In
	hot-hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences
	the relative concentrations of several spectroscopically dominant
	species. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar value) and 2, the H2O and CH4
	abundances can vary by several orders of magnitude in the observable
	atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN and C2H2 become
	prominent for C/O >= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost unchanged.
	Furthermore, a C/O >= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due
	to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally
	underabundant for C/O >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new 2D classification
	scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with irradiation
	(or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define four
	classes in this 2D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical,
	thermal, and spectral properties. Based on the most recent observations,
	we characterize the thermal structure and C/O ratios of six hot Jupiters
	(XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and WASP-12b) in
	the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the
	data for several systems in our sample are consistent with C-rich
	atmospheres, new observations are required to conclusively constrain
	their C/O ratios in the day side as well as the terminator regions
	of their atmospheres. We discuss how observations using existing
	and forthcoming facilities can constrain C/O ratios in exoplanetary
	atmospheres.},

  abstract = {A dedicated mission to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres represents
	a major milestone in our quest to understand our place in the universe
	by placing our Solar System in context and by addressing the suitability
	of planets for the presence of life. EChO-the Exoplanet Characterisation
	Observatory-is a mission concept specifically geared for this purpose.
	EChO will provide simultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations
	on a stable platform that will allow very long exposures. The use
	of passive cooling, few moving parts and well established technology
	gives a low-risk and potentially long-lived mission. EChO will build
	on observations by Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based telescopes, which
	discovered the first molecules and atoms in exoplanetary atmospheres.
	However, EChO's configuration and specifications are designed to
	study a number of systems in a consistent manner that will eliminate
	the ambiguities affecting prior observations. EChO will simultaneously
	observe a broad enough spectral region-from the visible to the mid-infrared-to
	constrain from one single spectrum the temperature structure of the
	atmosphere, the abundances of the major carbon and oxygen bearing
	species, the expected photochemically-produced species and magnetospheric
	signatures. The spectral range and resolution are tailored to separate
	bands belonging to up to 30 molecules and retrieve the composition
	and temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list
	for EChO includes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium
	temperatures T (eq) up to 2,000 K, to those of a few Earth masses,
	with T (eq) \textbackslash{}u223c 300 K. The list will include planets
	with no Solar System analog, such as the recently discovered planets
	GJ1214b, whose density lies between that of terrestrial and gaseous
	planets, or the rocky-iron planet 55 Cnc e, with day-side temperature
	close to 3,000 K. As the number of detected exoplanets is growing
	rapidly each year, and the mass and radius of those detected steadily
	decreases, the target list will be constantly adjusted to include
	the most interesting systems. We have baselined a dispersive spectrograph
	design covering continuously the 0.4-16 mu m spectral range in 6
	channels (1 in the visible, 5 in the InfraRed), which allows the
	spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,
	depending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted
	behind a 1.5 m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the
	instrument structure and optics passively cooled to \textbackslash{}u223c45
	K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit around L2. This orbit,
	in combination with an optimised thermal shield design, provides
	a highly stable thermal environment and a high degree of visibility
	of the sky to observe repeatedly several tens of targets over the
	year. Both the baseline and alternative designs have been evaluated
	and no critical items with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) less
	than 4-5 have been identified. We have also undertaken a first-order
	cost and development plan analysis and find that EChO is easily compatible
	with the ESA M-class mission framework.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent spectroscopic evidence for carbon-rich atmospheres
	on some transiting exoplanets, we investigate the influence of the
	C/O ratio on the chemistry, composition, and spectra of extrasolar
	giant planets both from a thermochemical equilibrium perspective
	and from consideration of disequilibrium processes like photochemistry
	and transport-induced quenching. We find that although CO is predicted
	to be a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters for all C/O
	ratios, other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much
	more abundant when C/O < 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly
	in abundance when C/O > 1. Other notable species like N-2 and NH3
	that do not contain carbon or oxygen are relatively unaffected by
	the C/O ratio. Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance
	of CH4, NH3, HCN, and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare
	the results of our models with secondary-eclipse photometric data
	from the Spitzer Space Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium
	models with C/O similar to 1 are consistent with spectra of WASP-12b,
	XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b, confirming the possible carbon-rich nature of
	these planets; (2) spectra from HD 189733b are consistent with C/O
	less than or similar to 1, but as the assumed metallicity is increased
	above solar, the required C/O ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent
	too much H2O absorption; (3) species like HCN can have a significant
	influence on spectral behavior in the 3.6 and 8.0 mu m Spitzer channels,
	potentially providing even more opacity than CH4 when C/O > 1; and
	(4) the very high CO2 abundance inferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared
	observations cannot be explained through equilibrium or disequilibrium
	chemistry in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. We discuss possible
	formation mechanisms for carbon-rich hot Jupiters, including scenarios
	in which the accretion of CO-rich, H2O-poor gas dominates the atmospheric
	envelope, and scenarios in which the planets accrete carbon-rich
	solids while migrating through disk regions inward of the snow line.
	The C/O ratio and bulk atmospheric metallicity provide important
	clues regarding the formation and evolution of the giant planets.},

	and one transit was done in the JHK(s) bands simultaneously with
	the Simultaneous Infrared Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) camera
	on the Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF) 1.4 m telescope. Markov Chain
	Monte Carlo analyses show that the planet-to-star radius ratios are
	R-p/R-s = 0.11651 +/- 0.00065 (B band, Subaru/Suprime-Cam), R-p/R-s

	approach that allows solutions beyond the range permitted by ab initio

	from prior expectations. We show that optimal estimation retrieval
	is a powerful tool for this kind of study, and present an exploration
	of the degenerate atmospheric scenarios for GJ 1214b. Whilst we find
	a family of solutions that provide a very good fit to the data, the

	of a high molecular weight atmosphere. Future ground- and space-based

For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH 4 and NH 3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons (particularly C 2 H 2 ), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like OH, CH 3 , and NH 2 . In contrast, CO, H 2 O, N 2 , and CO 2 more closely follow their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 μbar, where CO, H 2 O, and N 2 are photochemically destroyed and CO 2 is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction.

abstract = {To investigate the details of hydrocarbon photochemistry on Saturn, we have developed a one-dimensional diurnally averaged model that couples hydrocarbon and oxygen photochemistry, molecular and eddy diffusion, radiative transfer, and condensation. The model results are compared with observations from the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) to place tighter constraints on molecular abundances, to better define Saturn's eddy diffusion coefficient profile, and to identify important chemical schemes that control the abundances of the observable hydrocarbons in Saturn's upper atmosphere. From the \{ISO\} observations, we determine that the column densities of CH3, CH3C2H, and \{C4H2\} above 10 mbar are 4+2−1.5×1013 cm−2, (1.1±0.3)×1015 cm−2, and (1.2±0.3)×1014 cm−2, respectively. The observed \{ISO\} emission features also indicate \{C2H2\} mixing ratios of 1.2+0.9−0.6×10−6 at 0.3 mbar and (2.7±0.8)×10−7 at 1.4 mbar, and a \{C2H6\} mixing ratio of (9±2.5)×10−6 at 0.5 mbar. Upper limits are provided for C2H4, CH2CCH2, C3H8, and C6H2. The sensitivity of the model results to variations in the eddy diffusion coefficient profile, the solar flux, the \{CH4\} photolysis branching ratios, the atomic hydrogen influx, and key reaction rates are discussed in detail. We find that \{C4H2\} and \{CH3C2H\} are particularly good tracers of important chemical processes and physical conditions in Saturn's upper atmosphere, and \{C2H6\} is a good tracer of the eddy diffusion coefficient in Saturn's lower stratosphere. The eddy diffusion coefficient must be smaller than ∼3×104 cm2 s−1 at pressures greater than 1 mbar in order to reproduce the \{C2H6\} abundance inferred from \{ISO\} observations. The eddy diffusion coefficients in the upper stratosphere could be constrained by observations of \{CH3\} radicals if the low-temperature chemistry of \{CH3\} were better understood. We also discuss the implications of our modeling for aerosol formation in Saturn's lower stratosphere—diacetylene, butane, and water condense between ∼1 and 300 mbar in our model and will dominate stratospheric haze formation at nonauroral latitudes. Our photochemical models will be useful for planning observational sequences and for analyzing data from the upcoming Cassini mission.}

The calculations cover a wide temperature and pressure range in the upper portions of giant planetary and T-, L-, and M-dwarf atmospheres. Emphasis is placed on the major gases CH4, CO, NH3, N2, and \{H2O\} but other less abundant gases are included. The results presented are independent of particular model atmospheres, and can be used to constrain model atmosphere temperatures and pressures from observations of different gases. The influence of metallicity on the speciation of these key elements under pressure–temperature (P–T) conditions relevant to low-mass object atmospheres is discussed. The results of the thermochemical equilibrium computations indicate that several compounds may be useful to establish temperature or pressure scales for giant planet, brown dwarf, or dwarf star atmospheres. We find that ethane and methanol abundance are useful temperature probes in giant planets and methane dwarfs such as Gl 229B, and that \{CO2\} can serve as a temperature probe in more massive objects. Imidogen (NH) abundances are a unique pressure-independent temperature probe for all objects. Total pressure probes for warmer brown dwarfs and M dwarfs are HCN, HCNO, and CH2O. No temperature-independent probes for the total pressure in giant planets or T-dwarf atmospheres are identified among the more abundant C, N, and O bearing gases investigated here. "

Abstract = {{We have obtained spatially resolved spectra of Titan in the
   near-infrared J, H and K bands at a resolving power of similar to 5000
   using the near-infrared integral field spectrometer (NIFS) on the Gemini
   North 8 m telescope. Using recent data from the Cassini/Huygens mission
   on the atmospheric composition and surface and aerosol properties, we
   develop a multiple-scattering radiative transfer model for the Titan
   atmosphere. The Titan spectrum at these wavelengths is dominated by
   absorption due to methane with a series of strong absorption band
   systems separated by window regions where the surface of Titan can be
   seen. We use a line-by-line approach to derive the methane absorption
   coefficients. The methane spectrum is only accurately represented in
   standard line lists down to similar to 2.1 mu m. However, by making use
   of recent laboratory data and modeling of the methane spectrum we are
   able to construct a new line list that can be used down to 1.3 mu m. The
   new line list allows us to generate spectra that are a good match to the
   observations at all wavelengths longer than 1.3 mu m and allow us to
   model regions, such as the 1.55 mu m window that could not be studied
   usefully with previous line lists such as HITRAN 2008. We point out the
   importance of the far-wing line shape of strong methane lines in
   determining the shape of the methane windows. Line shapes with
   Lorentzian, and sub-Lorentzian regions are needed to match the shape of
   the windows, but different shape parameters are needed for the 1.55 mu m
   and 2 mu m windows. After the methane lines are modeled our observations
   are sensitive to additional absorptions, and we use the data in the 1.55
   mu m region to determine a D/H ratio of 1.77 +/- 0.20 x 10(-4), and a CO
   mixing ratio of 50 +/- 11 ppmv. In the 2 mu m window we detect
   absorption features that can be identified with the nu(5) + 3 nu(6) and

doi = {10.1073/pnas.1309107110},
abstract ={The habitable zone (HZ) around a star is typically defined as the region where a rocky planet can maintain liquid water on its surface. That definition is appropriate, because this allows for the possibility that carbon-based, photosynthetic life exists on the planet in sufficient abundance to modify the planet�s atmosphere in a way that might be remotely detected. Exactly what conditions are needed, however, to maintain liquid water remains a topic for debate. In the past, modelers have restricted themselves to water-rich planets with CO2 and H2O as the only important greenhouse gases. More recently, some researchers have suggested broadening the definition to include arid, �Dune� planets on the inner edge and planets with captured H2 atmospheres on the outer edge, thereby greatly increasing the HZ width. Such planets could exist, but we demonstrate that an inner edge limit of 0.59 AU or less is physically unrealistic. We further argue that conservative HZ definitions should be used for designing future space-based telescopes, but that optimistic definitions may be useful in interpreting the data from such missions. In terms of effective solar flux, Seff, the recently recalculated HZ boundaries are: recent Venus�1.78; runaway greenhouse�1.04; moist greenhouse�1.01; maximum greenhouse�0.35; and early Mars�0.32. Based on a combination of different HZ definitions, the frequency of potentially Earth-like planets around late K and M stars observed by Kepler is in the range of 0.4�0.5.},

   spectrometer, the photometer, and the camera) were combined to provide
   new and more precise thermal and compositional knowledge of Titan's
   stratosphere. With the high spectral resolution achieved by the SWS
   (much higher than that of the Voyager I IRIS spectrometer), we were able
   to detect and separate the contributions of most of the atmospheric
   gases present on Titan and to determine disk-averaged mole fractions. We
   have also tested existing vertical distributions for C2H2, HCN, C2H6,
   and CO2 and inferred some information on the abundance of the first
   species as a function of altitude. From the CH3D band at 1161 cm(-1) and
   for a CH, mole fraction assumed to be 1.9\% in Titan's stratosphere, we
   have obtained the monodeuterated methane-averaged abundance and
   retrieved a D/H isotopic ratio of 8.7(-1.9)(+3.2) x 10(-5). We discuss
   the implications of this value with respect to current evolutionary
   scenarios for Titan. The v, band of HC3N at 663 cm(-1) was observed for
   the first time in a disk-averaged spectrum. We have also obtained a
   first tentative detection of benzene at 674 cm(-1), where the fit of the
   ISO/SWS spectrum at R = 1980 is significantly improved when a constant
   mean mole fraction of 4 X 10(-10) of C6H6 is incorporated into the
   atmospheric model. This corresponds to a column density of similar to 2
   x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) above the 30-mbar level. We have also tested
   available vertical profiles for HC3N and C6H6 and adjusted them to fit
   the data. Finally, we have inferred upper limits of a few 10(-10) for a
   number of molecules proposed as likely candidates on Titan (such as
   allene, acetonitrile, propionitrile, and other more complex gases). (C)

Abstract = {Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main
   paradigms, namely the core accretion model and the gravitational
   instability model. These two formation scenarios support the hypothesis
   that the giant planet metallicities should be higher or equal to that of
   the parent star. Meanwhile, spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter
   HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen abundances range from depleted
   to enriched with respect to the star. Here, using a model describing the
   formation sequence and composition of planetesimals in the
   protoplanetary disk, we determine the range of volatile abundances in
   the envelope of HD189733b that is consistent with the 20-80 M-circle
   plus of heavy elements estimated to be present in the planet's envelope.
   We then compare the inferred carbon and oxygen abundances to those
   retrieved from spectroscopy, and we find a range of supersolar values
   that directly fit both spectra and internal structure models. In some
   cases, we find that the apparent contradiction between the subsolar
   elemental abundances and the mass of heavy elements predicted in
   HD189733b by internal structure models can be explained by the presence
   of large amounts of carbon molecules in the form of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons and soots in the upper layers of the envelope, as suggested
   by recent photochemical models. A diagnostic test that would confirm the
   presence of these compounds in the envelope is the detection of
   acetylene. Several alternative hypotheses that could also explain the
   subsolar metallicity of HD189733b are formulated: the possibility of
   differential settling in its envelope, the presence of a larger core
   that did not erode with time, a mass of heavy elements lower than the
   one predicted by interior models, a heavy element budget resulting from
   the accretion of volatile-poor planetesimals in specific circumstances,
   or the combination of all these mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Context. Oxygen (O) and carbon ( C) have been inferred recently to be
   subsolar in abundance from spectra of the atmosphere of the transiting
   hot Jupiter HD 189733b. Yet, the mass and radius of the planet coupled
   with structure models indicate a strongly supersolar abundance of heavy
   elements in the interior of this object.
   Aims. Here we explore the discrepancy between the large amount of heavy
   elements suspected in the planet's interior and the paucity of volatiles
   measured in its atmosphere.
   Methods. We describe the formation sequence of the icy planetesimals
   formed beyond the snow line of the protoplanetary disk and calculate the
   composition of ices ultimately accreted in the envelope of HD 189733b on
   its migration pathway. This allows us to reproduce the observed volatile
   abundances by adjusting the mass of ices vaporized in the envelope.
   Results. The predicted elemental mixing ratios should be 0.15-0.3 times
   solar in the envelope of HD 189733b if they are fitted to the recent O
   and C determinations. However, our fit to the minimum mass of heavy
   elements predicted by internal structure models gives elemental
   abundances that are 1.2-2.4 times oversolar in the envelope of HD
   189733b.
   Conclusions. We propose that the most likely cause of this discrepancy
   is irradiation from the central star leading to development of a
   radiative zone in the planet's outer envelope which would induce
   gravitational settling of elements. Hence, all strongly irradiated
   extrasolar planets should present subsolar abundances of volatiles. We
   finally predict that the abundances of nitrogen (N), sulfur ( S) and
   phosphorus ( P) are of similar to 2.8 x 10(-5), 5.3 x 10(-6) and 1.8 x
   10(-7) relative to H(2), respectively in the outer part of HD 189733b's
   atmosphere.},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2009},
Volume = {696},
Pages = {1348-1354},
Abstract = {We calculate the minimum mass of heavy elements required in the
   envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn to match the observed oversolar
   abundances of volatiles. Because the clathration efficiency remains
   unknown in the solar nebula, we have considered a set of sequences of
   ice formation in which the fraction of water available for clathration
   is varied between 0 and 100\%. In all the cases considered, we assume
   that the water abundance remains homogeneous whatever the heliocentric
   distance in the nebula and directly derives from a gas phase of solar
   composition. Planetesimals then form in the feeding zones of Jupiter and
   Saturn from the agglomeration of clathrates and pure condensates in
   proportions fixed by the clathration efficiency. A fraction of Kr and Xe
   may have been sequestrated by the H(3)(+) ion in the form of stable
   XeH(3)(+) and KrH(3)(+) complexes in the solar nebula gas phase, thus
   implying the formation of at least partly Xe- and Kr-impoverished
   planetesimals in the feeding zones of Jupiter and Saturn. These
   planetesimals were subsequently accreted and vaporized into the hydrogen
   envelopes of Jupiter and Saturn, thus engendering volatiles enrichments
   in their atmospheres, with respect to hydrogen. Taking into account both
   refractory and volatile components, and assuming plausible molecular
   mixing ratios in the gas phase of the outer solar nebula, we show that
   it is possible to match the observed enrichments in Jupiter and Saturn,
   whatever the clathration efficiency. Our calculations predict that the
   O/H enrichment decreases from similar to 5.5 to 5.1 time (O/H)(circle
   dot) in the envelope of Jupiter and from 15.2 to 14.1 times(O/H)(circle
   dot) in the envelope of Saturn with the growing clathration efficiency
   in the solar nebula. As a result, the minimum mass of ices needed to be
   injected in the envelope of Jupiter decreases from similar to 20.0 to
   18.6 M(circle plus), including a mass of water diminishing from 10.4 to
   9.3 M(circle plus). In the same conditions, the minimum mass of ices
   needed in the envelope of Saturn decreases from similar to 16.7 to 15.6
   M(circle plus), including amass of water diminishing from 8.6 to 7.7
   M(circle plus). The accretion of planetesimals with ices to rocks ratios
   similar to 1 in the envelope of Jupiter, namely a value derived from the
   bulk densities of Ganymede and Callisto, remains compatible with the
   mass of heavy elements predicted by interior models. On the other hand,
   the accretion of planetesimals with similar ice-to-rock in the envelope
   of Saturn implies a mass of heavy elements greater than the one
   predicted by interior models, unless a substantial fraction of the
   accreted rock and water sedimented onto the core of the planet during
   its evolution.},

Abstract = {We explore detailed chemical equilibrium abundance profiles for a
   variety of brown dwarf and extra-solar giant planet atmosphere models,
   focusing in particular on Gl 229B, and derive the systematics of the
   changes in the dominant reservoirs of the major elements with altitude
   and temperature. We assume an Anders \& Grevesse solar composition of 27
   chemical elements and track 330 gas-phase species, including the
   monatomic forms of the elements, as well as about 120 condensates. In
   our fiducial, limiting reference model, we do not assume that
   condensation sequesters elements at depth and present true chemical
   equilibrium calculations for the solar element mix. However, there is
   evidence in the atmosphere of Gliese 229B that it is depleted in heavy
   elements. To explore depletion and rainout, which are fundamentally
   nonequilibrium processes, we perform a series of rainout calculations in
   which refractory elements are withdrawn from the equilibrium in
   stoichiometric ratios via an ad hoc algorithm. Then we compare the true
   equilibrium results with the rainout results, with an eye to
   understanding the near-infrared spectrum of Gliese 229B, as well as the
   new ``L dwarfs{''} with T-eff's above similar to 1500 K. We address the
   issue of the formation and composition of clouds in the cool atmospheres

   low-temperature (less than or equal to 900 K), small-radius condensables

   responsible for the steep spectrum of G1 229B observed in the near-IR

Pages = {504-513},
Abstract = {Opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of
   ultracool dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. We report
   here on the detailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our
   group for this application. We also present tables of Rosseland and
   Planck mean opacities, which are of use in some studies of the
   atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs. For
   the tables presented here we have included the opacities of important
   atomic and molecular species, including the alkali elements,
   pressure-induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant opacity
   sources, but we neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each
   species how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of
   public databases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public
   databases, and our own numerical calculations. We combine these
   opacities with abundances computed from a chemical equilibrium model
   using recently revised solar abundances to compute mean opacities. The
   chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the settling of
   condensates in a gravitational field and is applicable to ultracool
   dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks.
   We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially
   increases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature at

Volume = {640},
Pages = {1063-1077},
Abstract = {Using a model for refractory clouds, a novel algorithm for handling
   them, and the latest gas-phase molecular opacities, we have produced a
   new series of L and T dwarf spectral and atmosphere models as a function
   of gravity and metallicity, spanning the T-eff range from 2200 to 700 K.
   The correspondence with observed spectra and infrared colors for early
   and mid-L dwarfs and for mid-to late T dwarfs is good. We find that the
   width in infrared color-magnitude diagrams of both the T and L dwarf
   branches is naturally explained by reasonable variations in gravity and
   therefore that gravity is the ``second parameter'' of the L-T dwarf
   sequence. We investigate the dependence of theoretical dwarf spectra and
   color-magnitude diagrams on various cloud properties, such as particle
   size and cloud spatial distribution. In the region of the L -> T
   transition, we find that no single combination of cloud particle size
   and gravity can be made to fit all the observed data. Our results
   suggest that current ignorance of detailed cloud meteorology renders
   ambiguous the extraction of various physical quantities such as Teff and
   gravity for mid-L to early T dwarfs. Nevertheless, for decreasing Teff,
   we capture with some accuracy the major spectral features and signatures
   observed. We speculate that the subdwarf branch of the L dwarfs would be
   narrower in effective temperature and that for low enough metallicity
   the L dwarfs would disappear altogether as a spectroscopic class.
   Furthermore, we note that the new, lower solar oxygen abundances of
   Allende-Prieto and coworkers produce better fits to brown dwarf data
   than do the older values. Finally, we discuss various issues in cloud
   physics and modeling and speculate on how a better correspondence
   between theory and observation in the problematic L -> T transition
   region could be achieved.},

  abstract={Neptune-sized extrasolar planets that orbit relatively close to their host stars often called ``hot Neptunes' are common within the known population of exoplanets and planetary candidates. Similar to our own Uranus and Neptune, inefficient accretion of nebular gas is expected produce hot Neptunes whose masses are dominated by elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. At high atmospheric metallicities of 10-10,000 times solar, hot Neptunes will exhibit an interesting continuum of atmospheric compositions, ranging from more Neptune-like, H 2 -dominated atmospheres to more Venus-like, CO 2 -dominated atmospheres. We explore the predicted equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry of generic hot Neptunes and find that the atmospheric composition varies strongly as a function of temperature and bulk atmospheric properties such as metallicity and the C/O ratio. Relatively exotic H 2 O, CO, CO 2 , and even O 2 -dominated atmospheres are possible for hot Neptunes. We apply our models to the case of GJ 436b, where we find that a CO-rich, CH 4 -poor atmosphere can be a natural consequence of a very high atmospheric metallicity. From comparisons of our results with Spitzer eclipse data for GJ 436b, we conclude that although the spectral fit from the high-metallicity forward models is not quite as good as the best fit obtained from pure retrieval methods, the atmospheric composition predicted by these forward models is more physically and chemically plausible in terms of the relative abundance of major constituents. High-metallicity atmospheres (orders of magnitude in excess of solar) should therefore be considered as a possibility for GJ 436b and other hot Neptunes.}

Abstract = {The hot Jupiter HD 189733b is the most extensively observed exoplanet.
   Its atmosphere has been detected and characterized in transmission and
   eclipse spectroscopy, and its phase curve measured at several
   wavelengths. This paper brings together the results of our campaign to
   obtain the complete transmission spectrum of the atmosphere of this
   planet from UV to infrared with the Hubble Space Telescope, using the
   STIS, ACS and WFC3 instruments. We provide a new tabulation of the
   transmission spectrum across the entire visible and infrared range. The
   radius ratio in each wavelength band was re-derived, where necessary, to
   ensure a consistent treatment of the bulk transit parameters and stellar
   limb darkening. Special care was taken to correct for, and derive
   realistic estimates of the uncertainties due to, both occulted and
   unocculted star spots.
   The combined spectrum is very different from the predictions of
   cloud-free models for hot Jupiters: it is dominated by Rayleigh
   scattering over the whole visible and near-infrared range, the only
   detected features being narrow sodium and potassium lines. We interpret
   this as the signature of a haze of condensate grains extending over at
   least five scaleheights. We show that a dust-dominated atmosphere could
   also explain several puzzling features of the emission spectrum and
   phase curves, including the large amplitude of the phase curve at 3.6 mu
   m, the small hotspot longitude shift and the hot mid-infrared emission
   spectrum. We discuss possible compositions and derive some first-order
   estimates for the properties of the putative condensate haze/clouds. We
   finish by speculating that the dichotomy between the two observationally
   defined classes of hot Jupiter atmospheres, of which HD 189733b and HD
   209458b are the prototypes, might not be whether they possess a
   temperature inversion, but whether they are clear or dusty. We also
   consider the possibility of a continuum of cloud properties between hot
   Jupiters, young Jupiters and L-type brown dwarfs.},

   the first visit, and 1.082-1.128 and 1.514-1.671 mu m for the second.
   The light curves were fitted using a Gaussian process model to account
   for instrumental systematics whilst simultaneously fitting for the
   transit parameters. This gives values of the planet-to-star radius ratio
   for the blue and red light curves of 0.156 50 +/- 0.000 48 and 0.156 34
   +/- 0.000 32, respectively, for visit 1 and 0.157 16 +/- 0.000 78 and
   0.156 30 +/- 0.000 37 for visit 2 (using a quadratic limb-darkening
   law). The planet-to-star radius ratios measured in both visits are
   consistent, and we see no evidence for the drop in absorption expected
   if the haze that is observed in the optical becomes transparent in the
   infrared. This tentatively suggests that the haze dominates the
   transmission spectrum of HD 189733b into near-infrared wavelengths,
   although more robust observations are required to provide conclusive
   evidence.},

Journal = MNRAS,

Volume = {419},
Pages = {2683-2694},
Abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring the
   wavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planets atmosphere
   during a transit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition.
   However, the expected signal is typically orders of magnitude smaller
   than instrumental systematics and the results are crucially dependent on
   the treatment of the latter. In this paper, we propose a new method to
   infer transit parameters in the presence of systematic noise using
   Gaussian processes, a technique widely used in the machine learning
   community for Bayesian regression and classification problems. Our
   method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of the
   instrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a
   specific dependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters,
   and naturally allows for the correlated nature of the noise. We give an
   example application of the method to archival NICMOS transmission
   spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter HD 189733, which goes some way towards
   reconciling the controversy surrounding this data set in the literature.
   Finally, we provide an appendix giving a general introduction to
   Gaussian processes for regression, in order to encourage their
   application to a wider range of problems.},

   within a 500-angstrom bandwidth. We used time series spectra obtained
   during two transit events to determine the wavelength dependence of the
   planetary radius and measure the exoplanet's atmospheric transmission
   spectrum for the first time over this wavelength range. Our
   measurements, in conjunction with existing HST spectra, now provide a
   broad-band transmission spectrum covering the full optical regime. The
   STIS data also show unambiguous evidence of a large occulted stellar
   spot during one of our transit events, which we use to place constraints
   on the characteristics of the K dwarf's stellar spots, estimating spot
   temperatures around T-eff similar to 4250 K. With contemporaneous
   ground-based photometric monitoring of the stellar variability, we also
   measure the correlation between the stellar activity level and
   transit-measured planet-to-star radius contrast, which is in good
   agreement with predictions. We find a planetary transmission spectrum in
   good agreement with that of Rayleigh scattering from a high-altitude
   atmospheric haze as previously found from HST Advanced Camera for
   Surveys. The high-altitude haze is now found to cover the entire optical
   regime and is well characterized by Rayleigh scattering. These findings
   suggest that haze may be a globally dominant atmospheric feature of the
   planet which would result in a high optical albedo at shorter optical
   wavelengths.},

Abstract = {Context. We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter
   HD 189733b, obtained at 3.6 mu m with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC)
   onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6
   microns suffered from strong systematics, and conclusions could hardly
   be obtained with confidence on the water detection by comparison of the
   3.6 and 5.8 microns observations.
   Aims. We aim at constraining the atmospheric structure and composition
   of the planet and improving previously derived parameters.
   Methods. We use a high-S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to
   improve the precision of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6
   mu m. The observation has been performed using high-cadence time series
   integrated in the subarray mode. We are able to derive accurate system
   parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter,
   scale of the system, and central time of the transit from the fits of
   the transit light curve. We compare the results with transmission
   spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations at the
   same wavelength.
   Results. We obtained the following system parameters of R-p/R-star =
   0.15566-0.00024(-0.00024)(+0.00011) , b = 0.661(-0.0050)(+0.0053), and
   a/R-star = 8.925(-0.0523)(+0.0490) at 3.6 mu m. These measurements are
   three times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength
   because they benefit from greater observational efficiency and less
   statistic and systematic errors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius
   ratio has to be corrected for stellar activity and present a method to
   do so using ground-based long-duration photometric follow-up in the
   V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio corrected for the
   stellar variability agrees with our previous measurement obtained in the
   same bandpass. We also discuss that water vapour could not be detected
   by a comparison of the planetary radius measured at 3.6 and 5.8 mu m,
   because the radius measured at 3.6 mu m is affected by absorption by
   other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.},

Abstract = {We present observations of six transits and six eclipses of the
   transiting planet system HD 189733 taken with the Spitzer Space
   Telescope's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) at 8 mu m, as well as a
   re-analysis of previously published data. We use several novel
   techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new
   correction for the detector ``ramp{''} variation with a
   double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better
   physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings
   are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of
   2.7\% (68\% confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times
   measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a
   lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second
   planets in this system above 20\% of the mass of Mars in low-order
   mean-motion resonance at 95\% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the
   planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64\% as bright as
   the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of
   17\% (68\% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability
   at 8 mu m causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary
   eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are
   comparable at the 8 mu m photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of
   transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of
   the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental
   limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption
   measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared
   limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar
   atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69
   s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and
   33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot
   spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot
   spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this
   system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an
   upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of
   this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric
   precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less
   than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after
   decorrelating with detector parameters.},

Abstract = {Water, methane, and carbon monoxide are expected to be among the most
   abundant molecules besides molecular hydrogen in the hot atmosphere of
   close-in extrasolar giant planets. Atmospheric models for these planets
   predict that the strongest spectrophotometric features of those
   molecules are located at wavelengths ranging from 1 to 10 mu m making
   this region of particular interest. Consequently, transit observations
   in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) allow the atmospheric content of transiting
   planets to be determined. We present new primary transit observations of
   the hot-Jupiter HD 189733b, obtained simultaneously at 4.5 and 8 mu m
   with the Infrared Array Camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.
   Together with a new refined analysis of previous observations at 3.6 and
   5.8 mu m using the same instrument, we are able to derive the system
   parameters, including planet-to-star radius ratio, impact parameter,
   scale of the system, and central time of the transit from fits of the
   transit light curves at these four wavelengths. We measure the four
   planet-to-star radius ratios, to be (R(p)/R(star))3.6 mu m = 0.1545 +/-
   0.0003, (R(p)/R(star))4.5 mu m = 0.1557 +/- 0.0003, (R(p)/R(star))5.8 mu
   m = 0.1547 +/- 0.0005, and (R(p)/R(star))8 mu m = 0.1544 +/- 0.0004. The
   high accuracy of the planet radii measurement allows the search for
   atmospheric molecular absorbers. Contrary to a previous analysis of the
   same data set, our study is robust against systematics and reveals that
   water vapor absorption at 5.8 mu m is not detected in this photometric
   data set. Furthermore, in the band centered around 4.5 mu m we find a
   hint of excess absorption with an apparent planetary radius Delta
   R(p)/R({*}) = 0.00128 +/- 0.00056 larger (2.3 sigma) than the one
   measured simultaneously at 8 mu m. This value is 4 sigma above what
   would be expected for an atmosphere where water vapor is the only
   absorbing species in the near-IR. This shows that an additional species
   absorbing around 4.5 mu m could be present in the atmosphere. Carbon
   monoxide (CO) being a strong absorber at this wavelength is a possible
   candidate and this may suggest a large CO/H(2)O ratio between 5 and 60.},

Journal = ApJ,

Pages = {822-836},
Abstract = {We present new Spitzer observations of the phase variation of the hot
   Jupiter HD 189733b in the MIPS 24 mu m bandpass, spanning the same part
   of the planet's orbit as our previous observations in the IRAC 8 mu m
   bandpass (Knutson et al. 2007). We find that the minimum
   hemisphere-averaged flux from the planet in this bandpass is 76\% +/-
   3\% of the maximum flux; this corresponds to minimum and maximum
   hemisphere-averaged brightness temperatures of 984 +/- 48 K and 1220 +/-
   47 K, respectively. The planet reaches its maximum flux at an orbital
   phase of 0.396 +/- 0.022, corresponding to a hot region shifted 20
   degrees-30 degrees east of the substellar point. Because tidally locked
   hot Jupiters would have enormous day-night temperature differences in
   the absence of winds, the small amplitude of the observed phase
   variation indicates that the planet's atmosphere efficiently transports
   thermal energy from the day side to the night side at the 24 mu m
   photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature differences. The
   similarities between the 8 and 24 mu m phase curves for HD 189733b lead
   us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a
   fundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by
   these two wavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models
   indicate that the 8 mu m band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater
   than at 24 mu m, although the uncertain methane abundance complicates
   the interpretation. If these two bandpasses do probe different
   pressures, it would indicate that the temperature varies only weakly
   between the two sensed depths, and hence that the atmosphere is not
   convective at these altitudes. We also present an analysis of the
   possible contribution of star spots to the time series at both 8 and 24
   mu m based on near-simultaneous ground-based observations and additional
   Spitzer observations. Accounting for the effects of these spots results
   in a slightly warmer night-side temperature for the planet in both
   bandpasses, but does not otherwise affect our conclusions.},

Abstract = {Molecules present in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets are expected
   to influence strongly the balance of atmospheric radiation, to trace
   dynamical and chemical processes, and to indicate the presence of
   disequilibrium effects. As molecules have the potential to reveal
   atmospheric conditions and chemistry, searching for them is a high
   priority. The rotational - vibrational transition bands of water, carbon
   monoxide and methane are anticipated to be the primary sources of non-
   continuum opacity in hot- Jupiter planets(1-3). As these bands can
   overlap in wavelength, and the corresponding signatures from them are
   weak, decisive identification requires precision infrared spectroscopy.
   Here we report a near- infrared transmission spectrum of the planet HD
   189733b that shows the presence of methane. Additionally, a resolved
   water vapour band at 1.9 mu m confirms the recent claim(4) of water in
   this object. On thermochemical grounds, carbon monoxide is expected to
   be abundant in the upper atmosphere of hot- Jupiter planets, but is not
   identifiable here; therefore the detection of methane rather than carbon
   monoxide in such a hot planet(5,6) could signal the presence of a
   horizontal chemical gradient away from the permanent dayside, or it may
   imply an ill- understood photochemical mechanism that leads to an

Abstract = {`Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked
   because they are close (< 0.05 astronomical units, where 1 AU is the
   average Sun - Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in
   permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet
   and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able
   to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets(1-3). A
   key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy
   incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the
   temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report
   observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary
   systems(4-6), over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a
   `map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in
   brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a
   minimum brightness temperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness
   temperature of 1,212 +/- 11K at a wavelength of 8 mm, indicating that
   energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed
   throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot
   Jupiter 7. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphereintegrated
   brightness occurs 16 +/- 6 degrees before opposition, corresponding to a
   hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (
   when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later than
   predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

Title = {Intercomparison of general circulation models for hot extrasolar planets},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {355-377},
Abstract = {{We compare five general circulation models (GCMs) which have been
   recently used to study hot extrasolar planet atmospheres (BOB, CAM,
   IGCM, MITgcm, and PEQMOD), under three test cases useful for assessing
   model convergence and accuracy. Such a broad, detailed intercomparison
   has not been performed thus far for extrasolar planets study. The models
   considered all solve the traditional primitive equations, but employ
   different numerical algorithms or grids (e.g., pseudospectral and finite
   volume, with the latter separately in longitude-latitude and
   `cubed-sphere' grids). The test cases are chosen to cleanly address
   specific aspects of the behaviors typically reported in hot extrasolar
   planet simulations: (I) steady-state, (2) nonlinearly evolving
   baroclinic wave, and (3) response to fast timescale thermal relaxation.
   When initialized with a steady jet, all models maintain the steadiness,
   as they should except MITgcm in cubed-sphere grid. A very good agreement
   is obtained for a baroclinic wave evolving from an initial instability
   in pseudospectral models (only). However, exact numerical convergence is
   still not achieved across the pseudospectral models: amplitudes and
   phases are observably different. When subject to a typical
   `hot-Jupiter'-like forcing, all five models show quantitatively
   different behavior although qualitatively similar, time-variable,
   quadrupole-dominated flows are produced. Hence, as have been advocated
   in several past studies, specific quantitative predictions (such as the
   location of large vortices and hot regions) by GCMs should be viewed
   with caution. Overall, in the tests considered here, pseudospectral
   models in pressure coordinate (PEBOB and PEQMOD) perform the best and
   MITgcm in cubed-sphere grid performs the worst. }},

  abstract={We present here new transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter HD-189733b using the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We obtained two nights of observations where we recorded the primary transit of the planet in the J , H , and K bands simultaneously, covering a spectral range from 0.94 to 2.42 μm. We used Fourier analysis and other detrending techniques validated previously on other data sets to clean the data. We tested the statistical significance of our results by calculating the autocorrelation function, and we found that, after the detrending, autocorrelative noise is diminished at most frequencies. Additionally, we repeated our analysis on the out-of-transit data only, showing that the residual telluric contamination is well within the error bars. While these techniques are very efficient when multiple nights of observations are combined together, our results prove that even one good night of observations is enough to provide statistically meaningful data. Our observed spectra are consistent with space-based data recorded in the same wavelength interval by multiple instruments, indicating that ground-based facilities are becoming a viable and complementary option to spaceborne observatories. The best fit to the features in our data was obtained with water vapor. Our error bars are not small enough to address the presence of additional molecules; however, by combining the information contained in other data sets with our results, it is possible to explain all the available observations with a modeled atmospheric spectrum containing water vapor, methane, carbon monoxide, and hazes/clouds.}

Journal = AA,
Year = {2007},
Volume = {474},
Pages = {L21-L24},
Abstract = {Context. T-type dwarfs present a broad and shallow absorption feature
   centred around 6950 angstrom in the blue wing of the K doublet at 0.77
   mu m which resembles in depth and shape the satellite absorption
   predicted by detailed collisional broadening profiles. In our previous
   work, the position of the predicted line satellite was however somewhat
   too blue compared to the observed feature.
   Aims. In this paper, we investigate whether new calculations of the
   energy surfaces of the potentials in the K-H-2 system, including
   spin-orbit coupling, result in a closer coincidence of the satellite
   with the observed position. We also investigate the extent to which CaH
   absorption bands contribute to the feature and at what T-eff these
   respective opacity sources predominate.
   Methods. We present model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, including
   gravitational settling for an improved description of depth-dependent
   abundances of refractory elements, and based on new K-H-2 line profiles
   using improved interaction potentials.
   Results. By comparison with a high signal-to-noise optical spectrum of
   the T1 dwarf epsilon Indi Ba, we find that these new models do reproduce
   the observed feature, while CaH does not contribute for the atmospheric
   parameters considered. We also find that CaH is settled out so deep into
   the atmosphere that even turbulent vertical mixing would appear
   insufficient to bring significant amounts of CaH to the observable
   photosphere in dwarfs of later type than similar to L5.
   Conclusions. We conclude that previous identification of the feature at
   this location in the spectra of T dwarfs as well as the latest L dwarfs
   with CaH was erroneous, as expected on physical grounds: calcium has
   already condensed onto grains in early L dwarfs and thus should have
   settled out of the photosphere in cooler brown dwarfs. This finding
   revokes one of the observational verifications for the cloud-clearing
   theory assumption: a gradual clearing of the cloud cover in early T
   dwarfs.},

Abstract = {{GJ 436b is a warm-approximately 800 kelvin-exoplanet that periodically
   eclipses its low-mass (half the mass of the Sun) host star, and is one
   of the few Neptune-mass planets that is amenable to detailed
   characterization. Previous observations(1-3) have indicated that its
   atmosphere has a ratio of methane to carbon monoxide that is 10(5) times
   smaller than predicted by models for hydrogen-dominated atmospheres at
   these temperatures(4,5). A recent study proposed that this unusual
   chemistry could be explained if the planet's atmosphere is significantly
   enhanced in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium(6). Here we report
   observations of GJ 436b's atmosphere obtained during transit. The data
   indicate that the planet's transmission spectrum is featureless, ruling
   out cloud-free, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere models with an extremely
   high significance of 48 sigma. The measured spectrum is consistent with

   Aims. We started in March 2004 an exoplanet- search programme biased
   toward high- metallicity star stars which are more frequently host
   extra- solar planets. This survey aims to detect close- in giant
   planets, which are most likely to transit their host star.
   Methods. For this programme, high- precision radial velocities are
   measured with the ELODIE fiber- fed spectrograph on the 1.93- m
   telescope, and high- precision photometry is obtained with the CCD
   Camera on the 1.20- m telescope, both at the Haute- Provence
   Observatory.
   Results. We report here the discovery of a new transiting hot Jupiter
   orbiting the star orbiting HD189733. The planetary nature of this object
   is confirmed by the observation of both the spectroscopic and
   photometric transits. The exoplanet HD189733 b, with an orbital period

   Considering that HD189733 has. the same visual magnitude as the well

   zero), and velocity semiamplitude of K = 18.1 m s(-1). The minimum mass
   (M sin i) for the planet is 0.067M(Jup) = 1.2M(Nep) = 21M(Earth), making

   is only the second M dwarf found to harbor a planet, joining the

   questions about its constitution, with possible compositions of

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Since the first report of a potentially non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio
   (C/O) in its dayside atmosphere, the highly irradiated exoplanet
   WASP-12b has been under intense scrutiny and the subject of many
   follow-up observations. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar
   binary companions similar to 1{''} from WASP-12 has obfuscated
   interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new
   ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of
   WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical
   with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's
   stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H-2
   atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the
   transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as
   TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH)
   for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy
   observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband transit photometry
   from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3
   data to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere,
   respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the
   models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical
   significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis ofWASP-12b
   suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple
   Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870
   +/- 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated
   spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place
   definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Context. The observation of carbon-rich disks have motivated several
   studies questioning the influence of the C/O ratio on their gas phase
   composition in order to establish the connection between the metallicity
   of hot-Jupiters and that of their parent stars.
   Aims. We propose a method that allows the characterization of the
   adopted C/O ratio in protoplanetary disks independently from the
   determination of the host star composition. Titanium and vanadium
   chemistries are investigated because they are strong optical absorbers
   and also because their oxides are known to be sensitive to the C/O ratio
   in some exoplanet atmospheres.
   Methods. We use a commercial package based on the Gibbs energy
   minimization technique to compute the titanium and vanadium equilibrium
   chemistries in protoplanetary disks for C/O ratios ranging from 0.05 to
   10. Our calculations are performed for pressures in the 10(-6)-10(-2)

   Results. We find that the vanadium nitride/vanadium oxide and titanium
   hydride/titanium oxide gas phase ratios strongly depend on the C/O ratio

   observations. We find that the vertical profiles of molecular
   constituents are significantly affected by transport-induced quenching
   and photochemistry, particularly on the cooler HD 189733b; however, the
   warmer stratospheric temperatures on HD 209458b help maintain
   thermochemical equilibrium and reduce the effects of disequilibrium
   chemistry. For both planets, the methane and ammonia mole fractions are
   found to be enhanced over their equilibrium values at pressures of a few
   bar to less than an mbar due to transport-induced quenching, but CH4 and
   NH3 are photochemically removed at higher altitudes. Disequilibrium
   chemistry also enhances atomic species, unsaturated hydrocarbons
   (particularly C2H2), some nitriles (particularly HCN), and radicals like
   OH, CH3, and NH2. In contrast, CO, H2O, N-2, and CO2 more closely follow
   their equilibrium profiles, except at pressures less than or similar to
   1 mu bar, where CO, H2O, and N-2 are photochemically destroyed and CO2
   is produced before its eventual high-altitude destruction. The enhanced
   abundances of CH4, NH3, and HCN are expected to affect the spectral
   signatures and thermal profiles of HD 189733b and other relatively cool,
   transiting exoplanets. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the

   55 Cnc-e, including idealized treatments of magnetic drag and ohmic
   dissipation. We find that atmospheric pressures remain close to their

   supersonic winds which carry sublimating mass away from the substellar
   point, the atmospheres do not extend much beyond the day-night
   terminators. Ground temperatures, which determine the planetary thermal

   Atmospheric temperatures, however, which control cloud condensation and

   the atmospheric behavior, depending on atmospheric composition and the

Abstract = {{The Kepler mission has made an important observation: the first
   detection of photons from a terrestrial planet by observing its phase
   curve (Kepler-10b). This opens a new field in exoplanet science: the
   possibility of obtaining information about the atmosphere and surface of
   rocky planets, objects of prime interest. In this Letter, we apply the
   Lava-ocean model to interpret the observed phase curve. The model, a
   planet without atmosphere and a surface partially made of molten rocks,
   has been proposed for planets of the class of CoRoT-7b, i.e., rocky
   planets very close to their star (at a few stellar radii). Kepler-10b is
   a typical member of this family. It predicts that the light from the
   planet has an important emission component in addition to the reflected
   one, even in the Kepler spectral band. Assuming an isotropical
   reflection of light by the planetary surface (Lambertian-like
   approximation), we find that a Bond albedo of similar to 50\% can
   account for the observed amplitude of the phase curve, as opposed to a
   first attempt where an unusually high value was found. We propose a
   physical process to explain this still large value of the albedo. The
   overall interpretation can be tested in the future with instruments such
   as the James Webb Space Telescope or the Exoplanet Characterization
   Observatory. Our model predicts a spectral dependence that is clearly
   distinguishable from that of purely reflected light and from that of a

   CoRoT-7b (similar to 1.68R(Earth)) and Kepler-10b (similar to
   1.416R(Earth)) could be remnants of an initially more massive
   hydrogen-rich gas giant or a hot Neptune-class exoplanet. We apply a
   thermal mass loss formula which yields results that are comparable to
   hydrodynamic loss models. Our approach considers the effect of the Roche
   lobe, realistic heating efficiencies and a radius scaling law derived
   from observations of hot Jupiters. We study the influence of the mean
   planetary density on the thermal mass loss by placing hypothetical
   exoplanets with the characteristics of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and
   Uranus to the orbital location of CoRoT-7b at 0.017 AU and Kepler-10b at
   0.01684 AU and assuming that these planets orbit a K- or G-type host
   star. Our findings indicate that hydrogen-rich gas giants within the
   mass domain of Saturn or Jupiter cannot thermally lose such an amount of
   mass that CoRoT-7b and Kepler-10b would result in a rocky residue.
   Moreover, our calculations show that the present time mass of both rocky
   exoplanets can be neither a result of evaporation of a hydrogen envelope
   of a ``Hot Neptune{''} nor a ``Hot Uranus{''}-class object. Depending on
   the initial density and mass, these planets most likely were always
   rocky planets which could lose a thin hydrogen envelope, but not cores
   of thermally evaporated initially much more massive and larger objects.}},

Title = {{A SUPER-EARTH TRANSITING A NAKED-EYE STAR}},
Journal = ApJL,
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{737}},
Abstract = {{We have detected transits of the innermost planet ``e{''} orbiting 55
   Cnc (V = 6.0), based on two weeks of nearly continuous photometric
   monitoring with the MOST space telescope. The transits occur with the
   period (0.74 days) and phase that had been predicted by Dawson \&
   Fabrycky, and with the expected duration and depth for the crossing of a
   Sun-like star by a hot super-Earth. Assuming the star's mass and radius
   to be 0.963(-0.029)(+0.051) M-circle dot and 0.943+/-0.010 R-circle dot,
   the planet's mass, radius, and mean density are 8.63+/-0.35 M-circle
   plus, 2.00+/-0.14 R-circle plus, and 5.9(-1.1)(+1.5) g cm(-3),
   respectively. The mean density is comparable to that of Earth, despite
   the greater mass and consequently greater compression of the interior of
   55 Cnc e. This suggests a rock-iron composition supplemented by a
   significant mass of water, gas, or other light elements. Outside of
   transits, we detected a sinusoidal signal resembling the expected signal
   due to the changing illuminated phase of the planet, but with a full
   range (168 +/- 70 ppm) too large to be reflected light or thermal
   emission. This signal has no straightforward interpretation and should
   be checked with further observations. The host star of 55 Cnc e is
   brighter than that of any other known transiting planet, which will
   facilitate future investigations.}},

Title = {{Transiting exoplanets from the CoRoT space mission VIII. CoRoT-7b: the
   first super-Earth with measured radius}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{506}},
Pages = {287-302},
Abstract = {{Aims. We report the discovery of very shallow (Delta F/F approximate to
   3.4 x 10(-4)), periodic dips in the light curve of an active V = 11.7
   G9V star observed by the CoRoT satellite, which we interpret as caused
   by a transiting companion. We describe the 3-colour CoRoT data and
   complementary ground-based observations that support the planetary
   nature of the companion.
   Methods. We used CoRoT colours information, good angular resolution
   ground-based photometric observations in- and out- of transit, adaptive
   optics imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, and preliminary results from
   radial velocity measurements, to test the diluted eclipsing binary
   scenarios. The parameters of the host star were derived from optical
   spectra, which were then combined with the CoRoT light curve to derive
   parameters of the companion.
   Results. We examined all conceivable cases of false positives carefully,
   and all the tests support the planetary hypothesis. Blends with
   separation >0.40 `' or triple systems are almost excluded with a 8 x
   10(-4) risk left. We conclude that, inasmuch we have been exhaustive, we
   have discovered a planetary companion, named CoRoT-7b, for which we
   derive a period of 0.853 59 +/- 3 x 10(-5) day and a radius of R(p) =
   1.68 +/- 0.09 R(Earth). Analysis of preliminary radial velocity data
   yields an upper limit of 21 M(Earth) for the companion mass, supporting
   the finding.
   Conclusions. CoRoT-7b is very likely the first Super-Earth with a
   measured radius. This object illustrates what will probably become a
   common situation with missions such as Kepler, namely the need to
   establish the planetary origin of transits in the absence of a firm
   radial velocity detection and mass measurement. The composition of
   CoRoT-7b remains loosely constrained without a precise mass. A very high
   surface temperature on its irradiated face, approximate to 1800-2600 K
   at the substellar point, and a very low one, approximate to 50 K, on its
   dark face assuming no atmosphere, have been derived.}},

Title = {{THEORETICAL EMISSION SPECTRA OF ATMOSPHERES OF HOT ROCKY SUPER-EARTHS}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{801}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by recent detection of transiting high-density super-Earths,
   we explore the detectability of hot rocky super-Earths orbiting very
   close to their host stars. In an environment hot enough for their rocky
   surfaces to be molten, they would have an atmosphere composed of gas
   species from the magma oceans. In this study, we investigate the
   radiative properties of the atmosphere that is in gas/melt equilibrium
   with the underlying magma ocean. Our equilibrium calculations yield Na,
   K, Fe, Si, SiO, O, and O-2 as the major atmospheric species. We compile
   the radiative. absorption line data of those species available in the
   literature. and calculate their absorption opacities in the wavelength
   region of 0.1-100 mu m. Using them, we integrate the thermal structure
   of the atmosphere. Then, we find that thermal inversion occurs in the
   atmosphere because of the UV absorption by SiO. In addition, we
   calculate the ratio of the planetary to stellar emission fluxes during
   secondary eclipse, and we find prominent emission features induced by
   SiO at 4 mu m detectable by Spitzer, and those at 10 and 100 mu m
   detectable by near-future space telescopes.}},

Title = {{Constraining physics of very hot super-Earths with the James Webb
   Telescope. The case of CoRot-7b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{563}},
Abstract = {{Context. Transit detection from space using ultra-precise photometry led
   to the first detection of super-Earths with solid surfaces: CoRot-7b and
   Kepler-10b. Because they lie only a few stellar radii from their host
   stars, these two rocky planets are expected to be extremely hot.
   Aims. Assuming that these planets are in a synchronous rotation state
   and receive strong stellar winds and fluxes, previous studies have
   suggested that they must be atmosphere-free and that a lava ocean is
   present on their hot dayside. In this article, we use several dedicated
   thermal models of the irradiated planet to study how observations with
   NIRSPEC on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) could further confirm
   and constrain, or reject the atmosphere-free lava ocean planet model for
   very hot super-Earths.
   Methods. Using CoRoT-7b as a working case, we explore the consequences
   on the phase-curve of a non tidal-locked rotation, with the
   presence/absence of an atmosphere, and for different values of the
   surface albedo. We then simulate future observations of the reflected
   light and thermal emission from CoRoT-7b with NIRSPEC-JWST and look for
   detectable signatures, such as time lag, of those peculiarities. We also
   study the possibility to retrieve the latitudinal surface temperature
   distribution from the observed SED.
   Results. We demonstrate that we should be able to constrain several
   parameters after observations of two orbits (42 h) thanks to the broad
   range of wavelengths accessible with JWST: i) the Bond albedo is
   retrieved to within +/- 0.03 in most cases. ii) The lag effect allows us
   to retrieve the rotation period within 3 h of a non phase-locked planet,
   whose rotation would be half the orbital period; for longer period, the
   accuracy is reduced. iii) Any spin period shorter than a limit in the
   range 30-800 h, depending on the thickness of the thermal layer in the
   soil, would be detected. iv) The presence of a thick gray atmosphere
   with a pressure of one bar, and a specific opacity higher than 10(-5)
   m(-2) kg(-1) is detectable. v) With spectra up to 4.5 mu m, the
   latitudinal temperature profile can be retrieved to within 30 K with a
   risk of a totally wrong solution in 5\% of the cases. This last result
   is obtained for a signal-to-noise ratio around 5 per resel, which should
   be reached on Corot-7 after a total exposure time of similar to 70 h
   with NIRSPEC and only three hours on a V = 8 star.
   Conclusions. We conclude that it should thus be possible to distinguish
   the reference situation of a lava ocean with phase-locking and no
   atmosphere from other cases. In addition, obtaining the surface
   temperature map and the albedo brings important constraints on the
   nature or the physical state of the soil of hot super-Earths.}},

Title = {ON THE VOLATILE ENRICHMENTS AND HEAVY ELEMENT CONTENT IN HD189733b},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {727},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Favored theories of giant planet formation center around two main
   paradigms, namely the core accretion model and the gravitational
   instability model. These two formation scenarios support the hypothesis
   that the giant planet metallicities should be higher or equal to that of
   the parent star. Meanwhile, spectra of the transiting hot Jupiter
   HD189733b suggest that carbon and oxygen abundances range from depleted
   to enriched with respect to the star. Here, using a model describing the
   formation sequence and composition of planetesimals in the
   protoplanetary disk, we determine the range of volatile abundances in
   the envelope of HD189733b that is consistent with the 20-80 M-circle
   plus of heavy elements estimated to be present in the planet's envelope.
   We then compare the inferred carbon and oxygen abundances to those
   retrieved from spectroscopy, and we find a range of supersolar values
   that directly fit both spectra and internal structure models. In some
   cases, we find that the apparent contradiction between the subsolar
   elemental abundances and the mass of heavy elements predicted in
   HD189733b by internal structure models can be explained by the presence
   of large amounts of carbon molecules in the form of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons and soots in the upper layers of the envelope, as suggested
   by recent photochemical models. A diagnostic test that would confirm the
   presence of these compounds in the envelope is the detection of
   acetylene. Several alternative hypotheses that could also explain the
   subsolar metallicity of HD189733b are formulated: the possibility of
   differential settling in its envelope, the presence of a larger core
   that did not erode with time, a mass of heavy elements lower than the
   one predicted by interior models, a heavy element budget resulting from
   the accretion of volatile-poor planetesimals in specific circumstances,
   or the combination of all these mechanisms.},
