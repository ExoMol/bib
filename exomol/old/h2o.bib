Title = {{Search for interstellar water in the translucent molecular cloud toward
   HD 154368}},
Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{503}},
Pages = {{780-784}},
Abstract = {{We report an upper limit of 9 x 10(12) cm(-2) on the column density of
   water in the translucent cloud along the line of sight toward HD 154368.
   This result is based on a search for the C-X band of water near 1240
   Angstrom carried out using the Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph
   (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observational Limit on the
   water abundance, together with detailed chemical models of translucent
   clouds and previous measurements of OH along the line of sight,
   constrains the branching ratio in the dissociative recombination of H3O+
   to form water. We find at the 3 sigma level that no more than 30\% of
   dissociative recombinations of H3O+ can lead to H2O. The observed
   spectrum also yielded high-resolution observations of the Mg II doublet
   at 1239.9 Angstrom and 1240.4 Angstrom, allowing the velocity structure
   of the dominant ionization state of magnesium to be studied along the
   line of sight. The Mg II spectrum is consistent with GHRS observations
   at lower spectral resolution that were obtained previously but allow an
   additional velocity component to be identified.}}}

Journal = CP,
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {387-400}},
Abstract = {{The electronic excitation spectrum and the associated absolute optical
   oscillator strengths for the photoabsorption of water have been
   determined in the energy region 6-200 eV using low resolution dipole (e,
   e) spectroscopy and TRK sum-rule normalization. In addition, detailed
   studies of the absolute photoabsorption oscillator strengths for the
   valence shell discrete electronic transitions of water have been made
   using high resolution dipole (e, e) spectroscopy (0.048 eV fwhm), from
   the first excitation threshold up to 30 eV. The present results are free
   of `'line saturation'' (i.e. bandwidth/linewidth interaction) effects
   which can lead to serious errors when absolute intensity measurements
   are made using conventional Beer-Lambert law photoabsorption methods.}}}

Abstract = {A potential energy surface for the major isotopomer of water is
   constructed by fitting to observed vibration-rotation energy levels of
   the system using the exact kinetic energy operator nuclear motion
   program DVR3D. The starting point for the fit is the ab initio
   Born-Oppenheimer surface of Partridge and Schwenke {[}J. Chem. Phys.
   106, 4618 (1997)] and corrections to it: both one- and two-electron
   relativistic effects, a correction to the height of the barrier to
   linearity, allowance for the Lamb shift and the inclusion of both
   adiabatic and nonadiabatic non-Born-Oppenheimer corrections. Fits are
   made by scaling the starting potential by a morphing function, the
   parameters of which are optimized. Two fitted potentials are presented
   which only differ significantly in their treatment of rotational
   nonadiabatic effects. Energy levels up to 25 468 cm(-1) with J=0, 2, and
   5 are fitted with only 20 parameters. The resulting potentials predict
   experimentally known levels with Jless than or equal to10 with a
   standard deviation of 0.1 cm(-1), and are only slightly worse for J=20,
   for which rotational nonadiabatic effects are significant. The fits
   showed that around 100 known energy levels are probably the result of
   misassignments. Analysis of misassigned levels above 20 000 cm(-1) leads
   to the reassignment of 23 transitions. (C) 2003 American Institute of
