  abstract = {We present a general variational method to calculate vibrational energy
	levels of Polyatomic molecules without dynamical approximation. The
	method is based on a Lanczos algorithm, which does not require storage
	of the Hamiltonian matrix. The rate-determining step of each Lanczos
	iteration is the evaluation of the product of the matrix and a trial
	vector. We use simple product basis functions and write the Hamiltonian
	as a sum of factorizable terms. With n one-dimensional functions
	in each off dimensions, the matrix-vector product requires no more
	than cn(f+1) multiplications for a single term involving c coordinates.
	Choosing a (potential optimized) discrete variable representation
	(DVR) in each dimension, the potential energy matrix is diagonal.
	The rate-determining step is now the multiplication of a vector by
	the kinetic energy matrix and c is effectively (with rare exceptions)
	at most two. The n(f+1) scaling holds for both diagonal and mixed
	second derivative operators. The method is directly applicable to
	any three-atom and any nonlinear four-atom molecule. We use a variety
	of coordinate systems (Jacobi, Radau, a hybrid of the two, and bond),
	for which the total number of factorizable terms in the exact kinetic
	energy operator is never large, to calculate very well-converged
	band origins of H2O up to 22 000 cm-1, of H-3+ up to 18 000 cm-1,
	and of CH2O up to 5700 cm-1; and low-lying levels of H2O2. The results
	for CH2O are new, and those for H-3+ clarify the causes of discrepancies
	in published work. The product basis results in very large matrices
	(up to 500 000 X 500 000 for four atoms), but the cost is within
	an order of magnitude of that of contracted-basis approaches using
	explicit diagonalization. While contracted basis approaches are molecule
	and Hamiltonian specific, it was possible to apply the DVR-Lanczos
	method to all the examples presented here with a single computer
	program. The principal advantage of our method is thus its generality,
	and in this context it is efficient, with the cost scaling slowly
	with basis size. It is also easily parallelized.},

	multiconfigurational second order perturbation theory (CASPT2) calculations,
	both using large basis sets, are performed for a wide range of geometries
	(8145 DFT and 5310 CASPT2 single-point energies). We use a combined
	data set of mostly DFT with additional CASPT2 ab initio points and
	the complete CASPT2 surface to fit a total of four different 6D analytical
	representations. The resulting potentials contain 70-76 freely adjusted
	parameters and represent the ground state PES up to 40000 cm(-1)

	with the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo method in perfect agreement,
	within statistical error bars, with experiment for the CASPT2 based

  abstract = {A new discrete variable representation (DVR) in generalized vibrational
	coordinates is proposed together with a new mixed diabatic/adiabatic
	contraction technique for the treatment of multidimensional vibrational
	problems up to high vibrational excitations. Formally based on the
	equidistant Chebyshev DVR in the grid index the new formulation is
	particularly suitable for multidimensional minimum energy paths.
	The new Z-matrix DVR proposed in this paper encompasses usual valence
	coordinates as well as nonlinear maps of coordinates on optimal nonequidistant
	grids. The pointwise numerical calculation of all kinetic energy
	terms avoids the algebraic derivation of specialized analytical forms
	of the kinetic energy adding to the flexibility of the method. With
	efficient truncation schemes the generalized DVR allows for a compact
	representation of the time-dependent wave-packet dynamics in up to
	six dimensions. Vibrationally adiabatic approaches to the detailed
	modelling of multidimensional quantum-dynamics usually are hampered
	by the typically large number of (avoided) crossings in dense spectra.
	This problem is particularly severe for discrete variable representations.
	A solution is provided by the new technique of diabatic rotations
	leading to a systematic construction of locally diabatic channels.
	This allows the treatment of very dense spectra where conventional
	truncation techniques fail. Applying the new approach to the vibrational
	problem of tetratomic molecules demonstrates its flexibility and
	efficiency. The examples of formaldehyde, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide
	cover the whole range from semirigid (CH2O) to large amplitude inversion
	(NH3) and torsional tunnelling dynamics (H2O2). In solving the full
	six-dimensional vibrational eigenvalue problems for CH2O and NH3
	the Z-matrix DVR shows at least comparable if not superior numerical
	efficiency compared with specialized techniques. In the case of H2O2
	the technique of diabatic rotations and adiabatic contraction for
	the first time allows the treatment of the tunneling dynamics significantly
	above the dissociation threshold up to the fifth OH stretch overtone.
	The calculated decrease of the tunneling rate by about one order
	of magnitude agrees well with experimental observations. (C) 2000
