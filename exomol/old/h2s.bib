abstract ={Pure rotational transitions of H$_2$S'~, H$_2$S, and H$_2$S have been measured with high precision in the region of one to two millimeters. From these measurements the SH bond length is found to be 1.3226A and the bond angle to be 92' 6'. The S"nuclear quadrupole coupling observed along the principal inertial axes are egg, =—32 Mc/sec, egqsp= —8 Mc/sec, and egg„=+40Mc/sec. Approximate analysis of the quadrupole coupling constants shows that the bonding orbitals of S are spd hybrids and yields a value of —0.06X10 ' cm' for the quadrupole moment of the S"nucleus. From the known ratio Q"/Q" this gives Q"=0.04X10 ' cm'". Zeeman studies show that the molecular gs factor is approximately, but not exactly, equal for diBerent rotational states. A mean value of 0.24 nuclear magneton is found for gz.}

title   = {{Effect of Centrifugal Distortion on the Shape of the Hydrogen Sulfide Fundamental Infrared Bands}},
abstract ={The fundamental infrared vibration bands of hydrogen sulfide exhibit an interesting intensity anomaly characterized by P branches which are much weaker than the corresponding R branches. This work shows that this anomaly is caused by centrifugal distortion of the nonrigid molecule. A formalism based on a semiclassical approach is used to calculate the vibration-rotational line positions and their intensities. The computed theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental spectra. This formalism also gives a method of determining the relative sign of \ O/L/ oQ) with respect to /Lo. The values of (O/L/ oQ) needed in the calculations were obtained from the experimental integrated band intensities and were found to be (O/L/OQI) = -4.4 esu g-l and (O/L/OQ2) = +8.7 esu g-l.}

The effect of centrifugal distortion on the energy levels was computed by the Kivelson-Wilson method.}

Centrifugal-distortion corrections were applied in the rotational analysis, and transition intensities were computed in both the rigid-rotor approximation and with the inclusion of classical centrifugal distortion. The inertial constants arising from this analysis for the ground state are A=5.484, B=4.508, C=2.444; for the excited state they are A'=5.616, B'=4.585, C' =2.421s em-I, and the V2 band center is 855.45 em-I. These results together with information derived from previous investigations of D2S and H$_2$S have been used to evaluate the constants in the quadratic expression for the vibrational energy levels and to compute some of the constants in the general expressions for the moments of inertia as a function of vibrational quantum numbers. The experimental values of the inertia defect for the ground state and the VI and V2 excited states are in good agreement with those predicted theoretically.}

Title = {S-BEARING MOLECULES IN {O}-RICH CIRCUMSTELLAR ENVELOPES},
Journal = AA,
Year = {1993},
Volume = {267},
Pages = {490-514},
Abstract = {Using the IRAM 30m telescope, we have carried out a systematic survey of
   the millimeter line emission of SO2 and H$_2$S in various categories of
   0-rich circumstellar envelopes. The main sample contains 14 OH/IR stars
   of three classes: IRC objects with intermediate mass-loss rates, very
   cold OH/IR stars, and OH supergiants. Three lines of SO2 and two lines
   of H$_2$S were observed. Both molecules were detected in all the stars,
   with multiline detections in most of them. The J = 5 - 4 line of SiO,
   present in one of the observed frequency bands, was also detected in all
   objects. In addition, SO2 was detected in two SRb stars, and H$_2$S in the
   carbon star IRC+10216. Upper limits were obtained for the emission from
   15 other stars, both O- and C-rich. The 86 GHz line of SO was also
   detected in 5 stars.
   The lines of SO2 are found to be optically thin with a relatively low
   rotational excitation temperature (25 - 40 K), in good agreement with
   the chemical models predicting its photosynthesis in the outer layers of
   the envelope. The derived maximum abundances (approximately a few 10(-6)
   by number) also agree reasonably well with these models.
   The apparent rotational temperature of H$_2$S is inferred to be somewhat
   larger (approximately 50 - 100 K) and its line profiles appear somewhat
   narrower, suggesting a location of H$_2$S in inner layers of the envelope
   which have possibly not yet been fully accelerated. Models we have made
   for the infrared rotational excitation show that it is possible to
   account for the observational results with H$_2$S confined to the inner
   envelope with a relatively large abundance (approximately 10(-5)) and a
   cutoff radius of less than or similar to 10(16) cm. However, it is
   difficult to give a satisfactory chemical account of Such a Cutoff
   radius. It implies either a very low abundance of H
   (less-than-or-similar to 10(-5)), or a synthesis of H$_2$S on grains. The
   destruction of' H$_2$S much closer to the star than the destruction radius
   or H2O is also difficult to explain by photodissociation or grain
   processes.
   The overall abundance of sulfur in the gas phase of 0-rich circumstellar
   envelopes is certainty relatively large, probably at least approximately
   50\% of the solar abundance.
   A few outstanding stars are discussed in terms of their peculiarities:
   the line profiles of the bipolar nebula OH 231.8+4.2 are examined in

Abstract = {The rotational transition Frequencies of H$_2$S in the terahertz region were measured precisely up to 1.08 THz by a BWO-based scanning spectrometer at Cologne, Germany, and up to 2.56 THz by a laser sideband spectrometer at Lille, France. The data obtained were analyzed together with the available mmW, sub-mmW, and FIR data using the Watson-type Hamiltonian with the power series expansion of 35 parameters up to J(10) terms and with the Pade approximation of 24 parameters up to J(8) terms. The results of the two different fits are compared and discussed. The present measurements are compared with those obtained with a FTIR spectrometer at its low-frequency limit, for the purpose of providing H$_2$S lines in the terahertz region as an absolute calibrator for FIR FT spectroscopy.

Altogether about 1948 lines have been assigned to the bands n1 / n2, n2 / n3, and 3n2 of the isotopic species H$_2$$^{32}$S, H234S, and H233S and the hot bands n1 / 2n2 0 n2 and 2n2 / n3 0 n2 of H$_2$$^{32}$S. The energy levels derived from the lines in the three bands were simultaneously fitted for all different isotopic species. It was necessary to take into account several interactions; the strong Coriolis resonance between n1 / n2 and n2 / n3, the other Coriolis resonance between n2 / n3 and 3n2 as well as the Fermi resonance n1 / n2/3n2. As an example it may be mentioned that forH2 32S 353 upper state energy levels with Jmax  18 were fitted using 80 variable parameters and the molecular parameters obtained reproduce the energy levels with a standard deviation of 1.3 1 1004 cm01.}

The transitions from the n1 / n3 band of 32SO2 cover the quantum number range 2 £ J9 £ 48, 0 £ K9a £ 16 and contain 66 lines from the P-branch, 46 lines from the Q-branch, and 6 lines from the R-branch. The self-broadening coefficients vary between 0.240 cm01/atm £ gSO2–SO2£0.504 cm01/atm. As with previously studied bands of SO2 a pronounced decrease of the broadening coefficients with increasing quantum number K9a was found. On the other hand, a significant trend on J9 could not be stated. Altogether, the absolute values of the self-broadening coefficients are comparable. For the self-broadening coefficients from the 2n2 band of H$_2$S with 4 £ J9 £ 13, 1 £ K9a £ 5 a decrease of the broadening coefficient with increasing J9 is obvious, whereas no K9a-dependence was found even when recently published data for the three fundamental bands were included.

abstract ={The overtone spectrum of H$_2$S has been recorded by intracavity laser spectroscopy in the 14100–14400 cm21 spectral region. The rovibrational analysis was performed allowing one to assign not only lines involving the pair of interacting states {(402), (303)} ({(601, 0), (602, 0)} in local mode notation), but also lines involving the interacting states {(322), (223)} ({501, 2), (502, 2)} in local mode notation). Indeed, apart from the strong H22 interactions that link the rotational levels of the states (606, 0) on the one hand, and the rotational levels of the states (501, 2) on the other hand, we observe that the rotational levels of the two pairs of states interact strongly through anharmonic and Coriolis-type resonances. These resonances transfer intensity to lines involving the (501, 2) pair of states. Altogether 80 rotational upper-state levels have been observed and reproduced satisfactorily using an Hamiltonian matrix that takes explicitly into account the various interactions and assumes the same vibrational energy and rotational constants for the two components of the local mode pairs. The following band centers have been obtained: n0 (601, 0)514291.122 cm21 and n0 (506, 2)514284.705 cm21. Finally a local mode-type behavior is evidenced by the values of the Hamiltonian constants, and refined vibrational local mode parameters are obtained.}

abstract ={The two triad systems of hydrogen sulfide (2n2 , n1 , and n3 near 4 mm and 3n2 , n1 / n2 , and n2 / n3 near 2.7 mm) were analyzed using 14 spectra recorded at 0.0056 and 0.011 cm01 resolution with the McMath Fourier transform spectrometer located at Kitt Peak National Observatory. Experimental upper state levels of H$_2$$^{32}$S, H234S, and H2 33S were obtained from assigned positions (as high as J  20 and Ka  15 for the main isotope) . These were fitted to the Areduced Watson Hamiltonian to determine precise sets of rotational constants through J10 and up to nine Fermi and Coriolis coupling parameters. Intensities of the two H$_2$$^{32}$S triads were modeled with rms values of 2.5\%, using the transformed transition moment expansion with 19 terms for 568 intensities of the first triad and 11 terms for the 526 intensities of the second triad. The second derivatives of the dipole moment with respect to normal coordinates were estimated in Debye to be: 22mx  00.004873 (90) ; 12mx  0.01372 (30); and 23mz  0.01578 (30). This confirmed that for hydrogen sulfide some of the second derivatives are larger than the first derivatives. The calculated line intensities were summed yielding integrated band strengths (in cm02 /atm at 296 K) as follows: 0.3315 for 2n2 , 0.4522 for n1 , 0.1201 for n3 , 0.0303 for 3n2 , 1.820 for n1 / n2 , and 2.869 for n2 / n3 . In addition, the hot band transitions were identified in both regions. Finally, a composite database of hydrogen sulfide line parameters was predicted for the 5- to 2.5-mm region.}

The observed spectrum is assigned to the (506, v2 5 1) states constituting a local mode pair in strong H22-type interaction. The rovibrational analysis has allowed the assignment of 210 lines involving 86 rotational upper state levels which have been reproduced with a rms of 0.023 cm21 close to the experimental accuracy. A perturbation affecting one line is assigned to a local interaction with the (406, v2 5 3) local mode pair. The influence of the bending excitation on the local mode character of the (n06, v2 5 1) stretch-bend combination levels is discussed on the basis of the values of the rotational constants and of the H22 interaction parameters.}

abstract ={The absorption spectrum ofH2S (1159 lines) has been recorded between 10 780 and 11 330 cm¡1 by intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS). As a result of the increase of sensitivity of ICLAS over previous Fourier transform investigations in the same spectral region, the number of experimental energy levels of the (40C, 1) and (40¡, 1) local mode states ((212) and (311) in normal mode notation) has been triplicated for the main isotopic species H$_2$$^{32}$S (198 compared to 62). Moreover, 112 energy levels of H234S and 25 energy levels of H233S, present in natural abundance in the sample, could also be determined. Three rotational levels of the (30§, 3) local mode pair of dark states ((132) and (231) in normal mode notation) of H32S could also be observed through extra lines borrowing their intensities via resonance interactions with line-partners of the dominant bands. The (40C, 1) and (40¡, 1) local mode states form a degenerate local mode pair, with the same rotational structure for the two components. The observed energy levels were reproduced by an effective Hamiltonian including the (40§, 1) and (30§, 3) interacting local mode pairs. This Hamiltonianwas applied either in the C2v or Cs symmetry groups leading to an rms deviation of 0.0058 and 0.0068 cm¡1 respectively, comparable to the experimental accuracy (0.0028 cm¡1). The degeneracy of the rotational structure of the (40§, 1) pair is unaffected by the interaction with the nearby (30§, 3) local mode states. On the contrary, an additional interaction with dark states lifts in some cases this degeneracy. The same effective Hamiltonian with scaled parameters was successfully used to reproduce the energy levels of the H233S and H234S isotopic species. Finally, the extremely weak 3º1 C 3º2 band of H$_2$$^{32}$S at 11 097.161 cm¡1 could also be detected leading to the determination of 70 levels of the corresponding (21C, 3) upper state ((330) in normal mode notation). The integrated intensities have been estimated for the bands corresponding to the (40C, 1) and (40¡, 1) upper states. A total of six transformed dipole moment parameters were derived from the measured line intensities allowing to simulate very satisfactorily the observed spectrum. The transition moment relative to the (40¡, 1) upper state is found about twice as large as the one relative to the (40C, 1) state.}

abstract ={An Intracavity Laser Absorption Spectrometer (ICLAS) based on a Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VECSEL) has been used to record the absorption spectrum of H$_2$S between 9540 and 10000cm1 with pressures up to 122 Torr (160.5 hPa) and equivalent absorption path lengths up to 45 km. More than 1600 absorption lines were attributed to the transitions reaching the highly excited ð40; 0Þ, ð30; 2Þ, and ð11þ; 4Þ states (local mode notation). The existing information relative to the ð40; 0Þ local mode bright pair at 9911:02cm1 was considerably enlarged, while the other states are reported for the first time. Eight hundred and ninety two precise energy levels were derived, including 181 and 28 levels for the H234S and H233S minor isotopomers, respectively. These energy levels were fitted using a Watson-type rotational Hamiltonian and the spectroscopic parameters were obtained, yielding an rms deviation of 0:006cm1 for the H$_2$$^{32}$S species—close to the experimental accuracy. The dark states—ð20þ; 4Þ and ð11þ; 4Þ—at 9647.77 and 9744:88cm1, respectively, were found to perturb the observed energy levels and were then included into the final energy levels modeling. The ð40; 0Þ states are very close to the local mode limit, i.e., with a mostly identical rotational structure. The ð30; 2Þ states are separated by 0:077cm1 and this separation holds for most of the rotational sublevels. The resonance interactions between the three local mode pairs—ð40; 0Þ, ð30; 2Þ, and ð20; 4Þ—and the ð11þ; 4Þ state affect in some cases specifically one of the component of the pair and then the energy separation of the corresponding near degenerate rotational levels. Line intensities were obtained on the basis of the relative intensities measured by ICLAS and from absolute values of the stronger lines measured separately by Fourier Transform Spectroscopy associated with a multipass cell. The transition intensities could be successfully modeled and the integrated band intensities are given and discussed.  2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.}

New evaluation of the band origin of the dark (012) state E = 6385.299cm1 is obtained from the fitting process which agrees well with recent prediction by Naumenko et al. (J. Mo!. Spectrosc. 50, 100-1 10 (2001)). Precise line intensity measurements were performed for more than 1200 absorption lines with accuracy varying from 1 to 7%. These intensities were modeled within 3.3% using wavefunctions derived in the process of the energy levels fitting. The transformed transition moment expansion with 29 terms for 1088 intensities was used. Detailed and accurate H$_2$S absorption line list was generated in the HITRAN format for the analyzed spectral region.}

Three hundred and fifty six precise energy levels were derived from the spectrum analysis for the (211), (H 2), (032), (13 1), and (230) states of the second decade. These levels were modeled using Watson-type rotational Hamiltonian with consideration strong Coriolis and weak Fermi resonance interactions. The RMS deviation ofthe fitting for the main H72S isotope species represented 0.006 cm' with 59 adjustable parameters. New evaluations of the vibrational energies E8539.56l7 cm' for the (131)-(000) band, E=8637.l6O1 cm1 for the (032)-(000) band and E=8539.9253 cm' for the (230)—(000) band have been obtained. The line intensities were fitted with rms deviation of 1 5%. The results obtained are compared with recent study2.}

Journal = AA,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {532},
Abstract ={{Context. Unbiased spectral surveys are powerful tools to study the chemistry and the physics of star forming regions, because they can provide a complete census of the molecular content and the observed lines probe the physical structure of the source. Aims. While unbiased surveys at the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths observable from ground-based telescopes have previously been performed towards several high mass protostars, very little exists on low mass protostars, which are believed to resemble our own Sun's progenitor. To help fill up this gap in our understanding, we carried out a complete spectral survey of the bands at 3, 2, 1, and 0.9 mm towards the solar type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. Methods. The observations covered a range of about 200 GHz and were obtained with the IRAM-30 m and JCMT-15 m telescopes during about 300 h of observations. Particular attention was devoted to the inter-calibration of the acquired spectra with previous observations. All the lines detected with more than 3 sigma confidence-interval certainty and free from obvious blending effects were fitted with Gaussians to estimate their basic kinematic properties. Results. More than 4000 lines were detected (with sigma >= 3) and identified, yielding a line density of approximatively 20 lines per GHz, comparable to previous surveys in massive hot cores. The vast majority (about two-thirds) of the lines are weak and produced by complex organic molecules. The analysis of the profiles of more than 1000 lines belonging to 70 species firmly establishes the presence of two distinct velocity components associated with the two objects, A and B, forming the IRAS 16293-2422 binary system. In the source A, the line widths of several species increase with the upper level energy of the transition, a behavior compatible with gas infalling towards a similar to 1 M-circle dot object. The source B, which does not show this effect, might have a much lower central mass of similar to 0.1 M-circle dot. The difference in the rest velocities of both objects is consistent with the hypothesis that the source B rotates around the source A. Conclusions. This spectral survey, although obtained with single-dish telescopes at a low spatial resolution, allows us to separate the emission from two different components, thanks to the large number of lines detected. The data of the survey are public and can be retrieved on the TIMASSS web site }},

title   = {{Theoretical rotational–vibrational spectrum of H$_2$S}},
abstract ={The high resolution rovibrational spectrum of H$_2$S has been evaluated from three-dimensional ab initio potential energy and electric dipole moment functions and variational rovibrational eigenfunctions, which took full account of anharmonicity effects and rotation-vibration coupling. The quality of the near equilibrium theoretical potential energy function has been checked by comparisons with experimental equilibrium structure, empirical quartic force fields, vibrational band origins, centrifugal distortion constants, and rotational energy levels. All parameters agree well with the available experimental data. Vibrational band intensities for the V 2, 2v2, VI' and V3 bands have been calculated from empirical and ab initio dipole moment functions and compared with experimental and theoretical integrated band intensities. The difficulties arising by the derivation of such data from the experimental intensities of H$_2$S are discussed. The theoretical results strongly suggest that higher than first derivatives are needed for a proper description of the dipole moment function. The room temperature absorption spectra have been evaluated ab initio for the pure rotational and the V2' 2v2, VI' and V3 transitions. The unusual intensity pattern of the P, Q, and R branches attributed to the rotational-vibrational coupling has been well reproduced. Absolute line intensities calculated previously by perturbation theory are compared with variational results. The purely theoretical line intensities agree satisfactorily with experiment for the bending transitions, however, the extremely flat regions of the dipole moment functions along the bond stretching displacements make the transition intensities very sensitive to the values of the dipole moment derivatives.}

abstract ={We report here a refinement of the potential energy surface for the electronic ground state of the H$_2$$^{32}$S molecule in a least-squares fit to experimental spectroscopic data. The calculations are carried out by combining an exact kinetic energy (EKE) approach to the calculation of the rotation–vibration energies of a triatomic molecule with the MORBID approach, which employs an approximate kinetic energy operator. The combined method has been described and applied to the water molecule in two previous publications [O. L. Polyansky, P. Jensen, and J. Tennyson, J. Chem. Phys. 101, 7651–7657 (1994) ; ibid., submitted for publication.]. The input data for the fit of the present work comprised rotation– vibration term values with J £ 10 for the vibrational ground state and the n2 state, and with J £ 5 for all other states that have been characterized by high-resolution spectroscopy. In total, we fit data for 31 vibrational states of H$_2$$^{32}$S. We have obtained a very accurate potential within the framework of the EKE approach. The root-mean-square deviation for the fitted vibrational energies was found to be 0.28 cm01 . The fit to all 450 input data had a standard deviation of 0.17 cm01 . In the final fit, 11 parameters were varied. Our analysis of the residuals (observed 0 calculated) from the fit provides even stronger evidence than analogous fits for water that we have reached a level of accuracy at which the breakdown of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation becomes the most important reason for the deviation between theory and experiment. In order to improve further the fit, the J, Ka-dependent nonadiabatic corrections to the kinetic energy operator for the nuclear motion must be explicitly considered.}

Abstract = {We develop a new one-dimensional photochemical kinetics code to address stratospheric chemistry and stratospheric heating in hot Jupiters. Here we address optically active S-containing species and CO(2) at 1200 <= T <= 2000 K. HS (mercapto) and S(2) are highly reactive species that are generated photochemically and thermochemically from H(2)S with peak abundances between 1 and 10 mbar. S(2) absorbs UV between 240 and 340 nm and is optically thick for metallicities {[}S/H] > 0 at T >= 1200 K. HS is probably more important than S2, as it is generally more abundant than S2 under hot Jupiter conditions and it absorbs at somewhat redder wavelengths. We use molecular theory to compute an HS absorption spectrum from sparse available data and find that HS should absorb strongly between 300 and 460 nm, with absorption at the longer wavelengths being temperature sensitive. When the two absorbers are combined, radiative heating ( per kg of gas) peaks at 100 mu bars, with a total stratospheric heating of similar to 8 x 10(4) W m(-2) for a jovian planet orbiting a solar-twin at 0.032 AU. Total heating is insensitive to metallicity. The CO(2) mixing ratio is a well behaved quadratic function of metallicity, ranging from 1.6 x 10(-8) to 1.6 x 10(-4) for -0.3 < {[}M/H] < 1.7. CO(2) is insensitive to insolation, vertical mixing, temperature (1200 < T < 2000), and gravity. The photochemical calculations confirm that CO(2) should prove a useful probe of planetary metallicity.},

Journal = AA,
Year = {2011},
Volume = {535},
Abstract = {Aims. We study the chemical complexity towards the central parts of the
   starburst galaxy M 82, and investigate the role of certain molecules as
   tracers of the physical processes in the galaxy circumnuclear region.
   Methods. We carried out a spectral line survey with the IRAM-30 m
   telescope towards the northeastern molecular lobe of M 82. It covers the
   frequency range between 129.8 GHz and 175.0 GHz in the 2 mm atmospheric
   window, and between 241.0 GHz and 260.0 GHz in the 1.3 mm atmospheric
   window.
   Results. Sixty-nine spectral features corresponding to 18 different
   molecular species are identified. In addition, three hydrogen
   recombination lines are detected. The species NO, H$_2$S, H2CS, NH2CN, and
   CH3CN are detected for the first time in this galaxy. Assuming local
   thermodynamic equilibrium, we determine the column densities of all the
   detected molecules. We also calculate upper limits to the column
   densities of fourteen other important, but undetected, molecules, such
   as SiO, HNCO, or OCS. We compare the chemical composition of the two
   starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC 253. This comparison enables us to
   establish the chemical differences between the products of the strong
   photon-dominated regions driving the heating in M 82, and the
   large-scale shocks that influence the properties of the molecular clouds
   in the nucleus of NGC 253.
   Conclusions. Overall, both sources have different chemical compositions.
   Some key molecules highlight the different physical processes dominating
   both central regions. Examples include CH3CCH, c-C3H2, or CO+, the
   abundances of which are clearly higher in M 82 than in NGC 253, pointing
   at photodissociating regions. On the other hand, species such as CH2NH,
   NS, SiO, and HOCO+ have abundances of up to one order of magnitude
   higher in NGC 253 than in M 82.},

Abstract = {We report observations of the expected main S-bearing species (SO, SO2
   and H$_2$S) in the low-mass star forming region L1689N. We obtained large
   scale (similar to300{''} x 200{''}) maps of several transitions from
   these molecules with the goal to study the sulphur chemistry, i.e. how
   the relative abundances change in the different physical conditions
   found in L1689N. We identified eight interesting regions, where we
   carried out a quantitative comparative study: the molecular cloud ( as
   reference position), five shocked regions caused by the interaction of
   the molecular outflows with the cloud, and the two protostars IRAS
   16293-2422 and 16293E. In the cloud we carefully computed the gas
   temperature and density by means of a non-LTE LVG code, while in other
   regions we used previous results. We hence derived the column density of
   SO, SO2 and H$_2$S, together with SiO and H2CO - which were observed
   previously - and their relevant abundance ratios. We find that SiO is
   the molecule that shows the largest abundance variations in the shocked
   regions, whereas S-bearing molecules show more moderate variations.
   Remarkably, the region of the brightest SiO emission in L1689N is
   undetected in SO2, H$_2$S and H2CO and only marginally detected in SO. In
   the other weaker SiO shocks, SO2 is enhanced with respect to SO. We
   propose a schema in which the different molecular ratios correspond to
   different ages of the shocks. Finally, we find that SO, SO2 and H$_2$S have
   significant abundance jumps in the inner hot core of IRAS 16293-2422 and
   discuss the implications of the measured abundances.},

Abstract = {Volcanic eruptions inject sulfur into the atmosphere mainly in form of
   SO2 and H$_2$S. The ratio of these species (H2S/SO2), which is usually used
   as the mirror of the oxidation state of the source magma, varies
   significantly according to the type of activity, tectonic setting etc.
   This study aims to investigate the role of the hot core of plinian and
   sub-plinian volcanic plumes (T > 600 degrees C) in sulfur speciation
   based on the thermodynamic equilibrium in this temperature range. We
   consider the hot core as a box model in which 1000 degrees C magmatic
   gas and 25 degrees C ambient air are mixed and show that it functions as
   a hot oxidizing reactor for S species. Processes inside the hot core
   usually decrease the H$_2$S content of the system but can either increase
   or decrease SO2 depending on initial oxidation state. Thus the SO2
   injected into the atmosphere is not essentially generated directly from
   the magma but it can be produced in the hot core as the result of H$_2$S
   oxidation. Besides, volcanic cloud compositions do not mirror the source
   conditions. Considering three types of tectonic settings (convergent
   plate, divergent plate and hot spot) we propose that H$_2$S emission is
   more likely under reduced conditions in divergent plate and hot spot
   volcanic settings.},

Title = {Estimation of hydrogen sulfide emission rates at several wastewater
   treatment plants through experimental concentration measurements and
   dispersion modeling},
Journal = {J. Air Waste Management Assoc.},

Abstract = {The management and operation of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP)
   usually involve the release into the atmosphere of malodorous substances
   with the potential to reduce the quality of life of people living
   nearby. In this type of facility, anaerobic degradation processes
   contribute to the generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), often at quite
   high concentrations; thus, the presence of this chemical compound in the
   atmosphere can be a good indicator of the occurrence and intensity of
   the olfactory impact in a specific area. The present paper describes the
   experimental and modelling work being carried out by CEAM-UMH in the
   surroundings of several wastewater treatment plants located in the
   Valencia Autonomous Community (Spain). This work has permitted the
   estimation of H$_2$S emission rates at different WWTPs under different
   environmental and operating conditions. Our methodological approach for
   analyzing and describing the most relevant aspects of the olfactory
   impact consisted of several experimental campaigns involving intensive
   field measurements using passive samplers in the vicinity of several
   WWTPs, in combination with numerical simulation results from a
   diagnostic dispersion model. A meteorological tower at each WWTP
   provided the input values for the dispersion code, ensuring a good fit
   of the advective component and therefore more confidence in the modelled
   concentration field in response to environmental conditions. Then,
   comparisons between simulated and experimental H$_2$S concentrations
   yielded estimates of the global emission rate for this substance at
   several WWTPs at different time periods. The results obtained show a
   certain degree of temporal and spatial (between-plant) variability
   (possibly due to both operational and environmental conditions).
   Nevertheless, and more importantly, the results show a high degree of
   uniformity in the estimates, which consistently stay within the same
   order of magnitude.
   Implications: Estimating emissions to the atmosphere is usually
   considered a complex task, especially when such discharge comes from
   diffuse or uncontrolled sources. In any approach to air quality control,
   just from the point of view of increasing knowledge or as a management
   problem in order to reduce present levels of pollution, accurate
   estimation of emission rates is revealed as a fundamental step.
   Evaluation from an indirect method provides a useful methodology in such
   cases. Combination of dispersion modeling with experimental air
   concentration measurements permits one to obtain a first estimation of
   H$_2$S emission rates at several wastewater treatment plants. In a
   subsequent refinement of the process, the initial constant average
   emissions calculated were improved, leading to the formulation of a
   time-varying emission model, as a function of environmental quantities.},

Together with previously reported FIR pure rotational transitions of H233S and H234S, these data are used to derive an improved set of rotational and centrifugal distortion constants. For the H233S species, electric quadrupole and magnetic spin-rotation hfs constants are also determined. The new data allow accurate frequency predictions throughout the submillimeter-wave region for the two isotopomers H234S and H233S, including hyperfine splittings for H233S. These predictions are of astrophysical relevance.}

  abstract={Sulfur gases are common components in the volcanic and biological emission on Earth, and are expected to be important input gases for atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets. We study the atmospheric composition and the spectra of terrestrial exoplanets with sulfur compounds (i.e., H 2 S and SO 2 ) emitted from their surfaces. We use a comprehensive one-dimensional photochemistry model and radiative transfer model to investigate the sulfur chemistry in atmospheres ranging from reducing to oxidizing. The most important finding is that both H 2 S and SO 2 are chemically short-lived in virtually all types of atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets, based on models of H 2 , N 2 , and CO 2 atmospheres. This implies that direct detection of surface sulfur emission is unlikely, as their surface emission rates need to be extremely high (>1000 times Earth's volcanic sulfur emission) for these gases to build up to a detectable level. We also find that sulfur compounds emitted from the surface lead to photochemical formation of elemental sulfur and sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, which would condense to form aerosols if saturated. For terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars or M stars, Earth-like sulfur emission rates result in optically thick haze composed of elemental sulfur in reducing H 2 -dominated atmospheres for a wide range of particle diameters (0.1-1 μm), which is assumed as a free parameter in our simulations. In oxidized atmospheres composed of N 2 and CO 2 , optically thick haze, composed of elemental sulfur aerosols (S 8 ) or sulfuric acid aerosols (H 2 SO 4 ), will form if the surface sulfur emission is two orders of magnitude more than the volcanic sulfur emission of Earth. Although direct detection of H 2 S and SO 2 by their spectral features is unlikely, their emission might be inferred by observing aerosol-related features in reflected light with future generation space telescopes.}

   circumstances, contamination and widely varying composition of gases can
   be overcome by optimizing wavelength modulation, resonance frequency
   tracking and an easy-to-use method enabling in situ monitoring
   calibration. A diode laser emitting around 1.57 mu m served as the
   excitation source; at this wavelength spectral overlap between H$_2$S and
   CO2 is substantial. Spectral interference was eliminated by optimizing
   the amplitude of wavelength modulation; furthermore, a simplified
   calibration method was implemented taking advantage of a nearby
   absorption line of CO2 providing fast and economical measurements.
   Frequency dependence of the photoacoustic signal was determined by two
   methods to ensure accuracy. For 10 s integration time and 6800 Hz
   modulation frequency, the minimum detectable concentration was 6 ppm (3

Journal = {Analyst},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {198-203},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen sulfide is a highly corrosive, harmful, and toxic gas produced
   under anaerobic conditions within industrial processes or in natural
   environments, and plays an important role in the sulfur cycle. According
   to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the
   permissible exposure limit (during 8 hours) is 10 ppm. Concentrations of
   20 ppm are the threshold for critical health issues. In workplace
   environments with human subjects frequently exposed to H$_2$S, e. g.,
   during petroleum extraction and refining, real-time monitoring of
   exposure levels is mandatory. Sensors based on electrochemical
   measurement principles, semiconducting metal-oxides, taking advantage of
   their optical properties, have been described for H$_2$S monitoring.
   However, extended response times, limited selectivity, and bulkiness of
   the instrumentation are common disadvantages of the sensing techniques
   reported to date. Here, we describe for the first time usage of a new
   generation of compact gas cells, i.e., so-called substrate-integrated
   hollow waveguides (iHWGs), combined with a compact Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectrometer for advanced gas sensing of H$_2$S. The
   principle of detection is based on the immediate UV-assisted conversion
   of the rather weak IR-absorber H$_2$S into much more pronounced and
   distinctively responding SO2. A calibration was established in the range
   of 10-100 ppm with a limit of detection (LOD) at 3 ppm, which is
   suitable for occupational health monitoring purposes. The developed
   sensing scheme provides an analytical response time of less than 60
   seconds. Considering the substantial potential for miniaturization using
   e. g., a dedicated quantum cascade laser (QCL) in lieu of the FTIR
   spectrometer, the developed sensing approach may be evolved into a
   hand-held instrument, which may be tailored to a variety of applications
   ranging from environmental monitoring to workplace safety surveillance,
   process analysis and clinical diagnostics, e. g., breath analysis.}},
