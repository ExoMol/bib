Abstract = {I present a progress report on including all the lines in the line
   lists, including all the lines in the opacities, and including all the
   lines in the model atmosphere and spectrum synthesis calculations. The
   increased opacity will improve stellar atmosphere, pulsation, stellar
   interior, asteroseismology, nova, supernova, and other
   radiation-hydrodynamics calculations. I also report on producing
   high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise atlases for use in verifying the
   line data and spectrum calculations, and as tools for extending
   laboratory spectrum analyses to higher energy levels. All the data are
   available on my web site: kurucz.harvard.edu.}}

   includes line parameters for 31 species and their isotopomers that are

   portion of HITRAN presently contains about 709,000 transitions between 0
   and 23,000 cm-1 and contains three molecules not present in earlier
   versions: COF2, SF6, and H2S. The HITRAN compilation has substantially
   more information on chlorofluorocarbons and other molecular species that
   exhibit dense spectra which are not amenable to line-by-line
   representation. The user access of the database has been advanced, and
   new media forms are now available for use on personal computers.},

Abstract = {A new parameter has been added to the compilation of atmospheric
   molecular spectroscopic data. This compilation contains fundamental
   parameters required for simulations of transmission and radiance
   calculations of molecular absorption properties due to rotational and
   vibration-rotation transitions. The new quantity is the weighted
   transition moment squared which is independent of both isotopic
   abundance and temperature. It fulfills a needed niche for upper
   atmospheric non-local thermodynamic equilibrium calculations in that it
   is directly proportional to the Einstein coefficients. In this paper, we
   review the development of this quantity as well as present relationships
   between the Einstein coefficients and oscillator strengths to the
   transition moment and other parameters on the compilation.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the status circa 2001, of the HITRAN compilation
   that comprises the public edition available through 2001. The HITRAN
   compilation consists of several components useful for radiative transfer
   calculation codes: high-resolution spectroscopic parameters of molecules
   in the gas phase, absorption cross-sections for molecules with very
   dense spectral features, aerosol refractive indices, ultraviolet
   line-by-line parameters and absorption cross-sections, and associated
   database management software. The line-by-line portion of the database
   contains spectroscopic parameters for 38 molecules and their
   isotopologues and isotopomers suitable for calculating atmospheric
   transmission and radiance properties. Many more molecular species are
   presented in the infrared cross-section data than in the previous
   edition, especially the chlorofluorocarbons and their replacement gases.
   There is now sufficient representation so that quasi-quantitative
   simulations can be obtained with the standard radiance codes.
   In addition to the description and justification of new or modified data
   that have been incorporated since the last edition of HITRAN (1996),
   future modifications are indicated for cases considered to have a
   significant impact on remote-sensing experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Since its first publication in 1973, the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic
   database has been recognized as the international standard for providing
   the necessary fundamental spectroscopic parameters for diverse
   atmospheric and laboratory transmission and radiance calculations. There
   have been periodic editions of HITRAN over the past decades as the
   database has been expanded and improved with respect to the molecular
   species and spectral range covered, the number of parameters included,
   and the accuracy of this information. The 1996 edition not only includes
   the customary line-by-line transition parameters familiar to HITRAN
   users, but also cross-section data, aerosol indices of refraction,
   software to filter and manipulate the data, and documentation. This
   paper describes the data and features that have been added or replaced
   since the previous edition of HITRAN. We also cite instances of critical
   data that are forthcoming. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Abstract = {We have prepared a series of four solar spectral atlases. The atlases
   illustrate the disk center photospheric spectrum from 0.7 to 22 mu m and
   the sunspot umbral spectrum from 1.2 to 21 mu m. The spectra were
   observed at high resolution (lambda/Delta/lambda similar to 300,000)
   with the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the McMath-Pierce solar
   telescope on Kitt Peak. When possible, solar observations at different
   air masses and on different days have allowed the less opaque telluric
   lines to be effectively removed from the program spectrum. The solar
   lines have been identified by searching the literature on atomic and
   molecular laboratory spectroscopy and when necessary by additional
   laboratory spectroscopy. Many new identifications have been made,
   including numerous SiO and hot water lines in the sunspot spectrum.},

Abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the
   Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) are each creating
   quantitative databases containing the vapor-phase infrared spectra of
   pure chemicals. The digital databases have been created with both
   laboratory and remote-sensing applications in mind. A spectral
   resolution of approximate to0.1 cm(-1) was selected to avoid degrading
   sharp spectral features, while also realizing that atmospheric
   broadening typically limits line widths to 0.1 cm(-1). Calculated
   positional (wave-number, cm(-1)) uncertainty is less than or equal
   to0.005 cm(-1), while the 1sigma, statistical uncertainty in absorbance
   values is <2\% for most compounds. The latter was achieved by measuring
   multiple (typically 9) path length-concentration burdens and fitting a
   weighted Beer's law plot to each wavenumber channel. The two databases
   include different classes of compounds and were compared using 12
   samples. Though these 12 samples span a range of polarities, absorption
   strengths, and vapor pressures, the data agree to within experimental
   uncertainties with only one exception.},
