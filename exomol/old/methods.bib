	Abstract = {The general relation between one-electron electric properties ε (dipole moment, polarizability, hyperpolarizability, etc.) of molecules calculated as energy derivatives (E) and as dipole expansion (D) is derived: εE=εD+εNHF, where εNHF represents the non-Hellmann--Feynman correction, which vanishes for wave functions satisfying the Hellmann--Feynman theorem. It is shown that in cases when the wave function does not satisfy the Hellmann--Feynman theorem (e.g., limited CI) not only the \{NHF\} correction may be very large, but what is more important, the elements of static polarizability tensors (α,β,γ, etc.) obtained via the dipole expansion are non-physical because they do not satisfy the Kleinman symmetry, and for example αijD≠αjiD, βijjD≠βjjiD or γiijjD=γijjiD≠γjjiiD (for i≠j, i=x,y,z). Finally, it is concluded that in the case of wave functions which do not satisfy the Hellmann--Feynman theorem only energy derivative methods are the correct way for calculations of one-electron electric properties of molecules. },

@article{81DiRoSa.ai,
	Abstract = {Two alternative definitions for the calculation of first-order properties from limited \{CI\} functions are discussed. It is argued that computing the first-order properties by the differentiation of the perturbed \{CI\} energy is more appropriate than using the Hellmann---Feynman theorem. The energy derivative definition of the first-order properties corrects the Hellmann---Feynman results for an incomplete variational treatment of the perturbation effects. The additional term which is referred to as the Brillouin correction is computed for the dipole moments of FH, H2O, \{NH3\} and \{CO\} using the \{CI\} functions involving single and double substitutions with respect to the \{HF\} determinant. It is shown that the Brillouin correction gives a substantial contribution to the dipole moment of the \{CO\} molecule. This indicates that it may be fortuitous that some data previously calculated from \{CI\} functions by using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem are close to the experimental value. The structure of the Brillouin correction is analysed in terms of the diagrammatic expansion of the correlation corrections to the first-order properties. Additionally, some rough estimates of the influence of the unlinked diagrams are obtained by computing the so-called corrections due to Davidson and Siegbahn. },

@article{11Nixxxx.Me,
	Abstract = {Many problems in Atomic and Molecular Physics can be understood conceptually and quantitatively by using symmetry-adapted, state-specific wavefunctions whose computation is geared so as to account for at least those parts which describe reliably the characteristics of closed-and open-(sub)shell electronic structures that contribute overwhelmingly to the property or phenomenon of interest. If additional terms in the wavefunction are required by the problem, this is feasible via methods of configuration-interaction or low-order perturbation theory. This is the main argument of the state- and property-specific approach (SPSA) to Quantum Chemistry. In this framework, the aim is to obtain the state wavefunction, Ψn, in the form a0Ψ 0n + Φ corrn, where a0 ≈ 1. Ψ 0n is a state-specific zero-order description of ground and excited states of the discrete as well as of the continuous spectrum. In general, it is multiconfigurational and its construction follows from the ``Fermi-sea'' set of orbitals. The Ψ 0n is used as reference for analysis and/or for further improvement of the overall calculation, if necessary. The level of accuracy of the computation of the remaining Φ corrn depends on the property under investigation. The arguments are supported by characteristic examples on ground and excited states of atomic, molecular and metallic Beryllium. Some of these SPSA results are compared with results from more conventional methods of electronic structure. Special attention is given to the weak bond of the Be2 X1Σ +g state, which has attracted the interest of quantum chemists for decades. By asserting that the formation of the bond at about 2.5 A˚´ is influenced by the interactions involving excited states, I point to the corresponding significance in zero-order (``Fermi-sea'') not only of p-waves but also of d-waves whose origin is in the valence-Rydberg state mixing of the lowest 1D and 1Po states of Be. Therefore, the ``Fermi-sea'' (``active space'') is represented by the Be set of {2s,2p,3s,3p,3d} orbitals. The initially heuristic predictions are supported by calculations (using the MOLPRO code) of the lowest seven Be21Σ +g states, whose Ψ 0n are obtained at the state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field level. These results are verified by the computation of a0Ψ 0n + Φ corrn at the MRCISD level, where indeed a0 ≈ 1 over the whole potential energy curve. This type of analysis and the corresponding results imply that by a properly justified choice of the zero-order orbital set, the origin of the Be2 bond is to be found in ``nondynamical'' -- type correlations. This conclusion differs from that of Schmidt et al. [J Phys Chem A, 2010, 114, 8687], who argued that the formation of the Be2 weak bond should be attributed exclusively to ``dynamical'' correlations that are defined with respect to the {2s,2p} ``active space'' associated with the Be1S ground state. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
	(MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24
	(!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	(CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

	{[}Zhang, Chu, and Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 88, 6233 (1988)] for quantum
	reactive scattering. (It can also be readily used for quantum eigenvalue
	problems). The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely
	simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal,
	as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ``universal,{''} i.e., independent
	of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions;
	it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different
	basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid
	points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential
	energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H + H2 -->
	H2 + H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities
	is achieved with only about 15\% more DVR grid points than the number
	of conventional basis functions used in previous S-matrix Kohn calculations.
	Test calculations for the collinear Cl + HCl --> ClH + Cl reaction
	shows that the unusual dynamical features of heavy + light-heavy
	reactions are also well described by this approach. Since DVR approaches
	avoid having to evaluate integrals in order to obtain the Hamiltonian
	matrix and since a DVR Hamiltonian matrix is extremely sparse, this
	DVR version of the S-matrix Kohn approach should make it possible
	to deal with more complex chemical reactions than heretofore possible.},

@article{12CsFaSz.method,
	Abstract = {Developments during the last two decades in nuclear motion theory
	made it possible to obtain variational solutions to the time-independent,
	nuclear-motion Schrodinger equation of polyatomic systems as ``exact''
	as the potential energy surface (PES) is. Nuclear motion theory thus
	reached a level whereby this branch of quantum chemistry started
	to catch up with the well developed and widely applied other branch,
	electronic structure theory. It seems to be fair to declare that
	we are now in the fourth age of quantum chemistry, where the first
	three ages are principally defined by developments in electronic
	structure techniques (G. Richards, Nature, 1979, 278, 507). In the
	fourth age we are able to incorporate into our quantum chemical treatment
	the motion of nuclei in an exact fashion and, for example, go beyond
	equilibrium molecular properties and compute accurate, temperature-dependent,
	effective properties, thus closing the gap between measurements and
	electronic structure computations. In this Perspective three fundamental
	algorithms for the variational solution of the time-independent nuclear-motion
	Schrodinger equation employing exact kinetic energy operators are
	presented: one based on tailor-made Hamiltonians, one on the Eckart-Watson
	Hamiltonian, and one on a general internal-coordinate Hamiltonian.
	It is argued that the most useful and most widely applicable procedure
	is the third one, based on a Hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy
	operator written in terms of internal coordinates and an arbitrary
	embedding of the body-fixed frame of the molecule. This Hamiltonian
	makes it feasible to treat the nuclear motions of arbitrary quantum
	systems, irrespective of whether they exhibit a single well-defined
	minimum or not, and of arbitrary reduced-dimensional models. As a
	result, molecular spectroscopy, an important field for the application
	of nuclear motion theory, has almost black-box-type tools at its
	disposal. Variational nuclear motion computations, based on an exact
	kinetic energy operator and an arbitrary PES, can now be performed
	for about 9 active vibrational degrees of freedom relatively straightforwardly.
	Simulations of high-resolution spectra allow the understanding of
	complete rotational-vibrational spectra up to and beyond the first
	dissociation limits. Variational results obtained for H2O, H-3(+),
	NH3, CH4, and H2CCO are used to demonstrate the power of the variational
	techniques for the description of vibrational and rotational excitations.
	Some qualitative features of the results are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper an effective Hamiltonian for a non-rotating
	diatomic molecule containing only crystal-field and spin-orbit operators
	is set up to describe the energies of the five spin-orbit components
	that arise in the ground electronic configuration of the nickel monohalides.
	The model assumes that bonding in the nickel halides has the approximate
	form Ni+X-, with an electronic 3d(9) configuration plus closed shells
	on the Ni+ moiety and a closed shell configuration on the X- moiety.
	From a crystal-field point of view, interactions of the positive
	d-hole with the cylindrically symmetrical electric charge distribution
	of the hypothetical NiX- closed-shell core can then be parameterized
	by three terms in a traditional expansion in values comparable with
	those for the vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 3/2 and vertical
	bar Omega vertical bar = 5/2 states by fixing A to its value in Ni+
	and then introducing an empirical correction factor for one off-diagonal
	orbital matrix element. In the second part of this paper the usual
	effective Hamiltonian B(J-L-S)(2) for a rotating diatomic molecule
	is used to derive expressions for the Q-type doubling parameter p
	in the two vertical bar Omega vertical bar = 1/2 states. These expressions
	show (for certain sign conventions) that the sum of the two p values
	should be similar to 2B, but that their difference can vary between
	-10B and +10B. These theoretical results are in good agreement with
	the two observed p values for both NiF and NiCl. The present formalism
	should in principle be applicable to NiBr and Nil, and to the halides
	of palladium, since Pd+ has a well isolated 4d(9) electronic ground
	configuration. Extension to metal halides having d(n) configurations
	with n < 9, or to platinum halides may present difficulties, since
	manifolds from the d(n) and d(n-1)s configurations may be heavily
	mixed, thus requiring ``too many{''} parameters in the electronic

	also present problems because of the large number of vibronic perturbations

@article{12HuSeBa.methods,
	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive photochemistry model for exploration of
	the chemical composition of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. The
	photochemistry model is designed from the ground up to have the capacity
	to treat all types of terrestrial planet atmospheres, ranging from
	oxidizing through reducing, which makes the code suitable for applications
	for the wide range of anticipated terrestrial exoplanet compositions.
	The one-dimensional chemical transport model treats up to 800 chemical
	reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wet deposition, surface
	emission, and thermal escape of O, H, C, N, and S bearing species,
	as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuric
	acid aerosols. We validate the model by computing the atmospheric
	composition of current Earth and Mars and find agreement with observations
	of major trace gases in Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. We simulate
	several plausible atmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets
	and choose three benchmark cases for atmospheres from reducing to
	oxidizing. The most interesting finding is that atomic hydrogen is
	always a more abundant reactive radical than the hydroxyl radical
	in anoxic atmospheres. Whether atomic hydrogen is the most important
	removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevant
	reaction rates. We also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e.,
	CH 4 and CO 2 ) are chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed
	in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition
	velocities to the surface control the atmospheric oxidation states.
	Furthermore, we revisit whether photochemically produced oxygen can
	cause false positives for detecting oxygenic photosynthesis, and
	find that in 1 bar CO 2 -rich atmospheres oxygen and ozone may build
	up to levels that have conventionally been accepted as signatures
	of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases. The atmospheric
	scenarios presented in this paper can serve as the benchmark atmospheres
	for quickly assessing the lifetime of trace gases in reducing, weakly
	oxidizing, and highly oxidizing atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets
	for the exploration of possible biosignature gases.},

	Abstract = {The conformation and dynamical behavior of molecular systems is very
	often advantageously described in terms of physically well-adapted
	curvilinear coordinates. It is rather easy to show that the numerous
	analytical expressions of the kinetic energy operator of a molecular
	system described in terms of n curvilinear coordinates can all be
	transformed into the following more usable expression: (T) over cap=Sigma(ij)f(2)(ij)(q)partial
	derivative(2)/partial derivativeq(i)partial derivativeq(j)+Sigma(i)f(1)(i)(q)partial
	derivative/partial derivativeq(i)+nu(q), where f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q),
	and nu(q) are functions of the curvilinear coordinates q=(...,q(i),...).
	If the advantages of curvilinear coordinates are unquestionable,
	they do have a major drawback: the sometimes awful complexity of
	the analytical expression of the kinetic operator (T) over cap for
	molecular systems with more than five atoms. Therefore, we develop
	an algorithm for computing (T) over cap for a given value of the
	n curvilinear coordinates q. The calculation of the functions f(2)(ij)(q),
	f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) only requires the knowledge of the Cartesian
	coordinates and their derivatives in terms of the n curvilinear coordinates.
	This coordinate transformation (curvilinear-->Cartesian) is very
	easy to perform and is widely used in quantum chemistry codes resorting
	to a Z-matrix to define the curvilinear coordinates. Thus, the functions
	f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) can be evaluated numerically and
	exactly for a given value of q, which makes it possible to propagate
	wavepackets or to simulate the spectra of rather complex systems
	(constrained Hamiltonian). The accuracy of this numerical procedure
	is tested by comparing two calculations of the bending spectrum of
	HCN: the first one, performed by using the present numerical kinetic
	operator procedure, the second one, obtained in previous studies,
	by using an analytical kinetic operator. Finally, the ab initio computation
	of the internal rotation spectrum and wave functions of 2-methylpropanal
	by means of dimensionality reduction, is given as an original application.

	by means of normal-mode decomposition (NMD) tables constructed from
	overlap integrals with respect to separable harmonic oscillator basis
	functions. Complementary rotational labels J(KaKc) are determined
	from rigid-rotor decomposition (RRD) tables formed by projecting
	rotational-vibrational wave functions (J not equal 0) onto products
	of symmetrized rigid-rotor basis functions and previously computed
	(J=0) vibrational eigenstates. Variational results for H(2)O, HNCO,
	trans-HCOD, NCCO, and H(2)CCO are presented to demonstrate the NMD
	and RRD schemes. The NMD analysis highlights several resonances at
	low energies that cause strong mixing and cloud the assignment of
	fundamental vibrations, even in such simple molecules. As the vibrational
	energy increases, the NMD scheme documents and quantifies the breakdown
	of the normal-mode model. The RRD procedure proves effective in providing
	unambiguous rotational assignments for the chosen test molecules
	up to moderate J values. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

	Abstract = {{Correlation consistent basis sets for accurately describing core--core
	and core--valence correlation effects in atoms and molecules have
	been developed for the second row atoms Al--Ar. Two different optimization
	strategies were investigated, which led to two families of core--valence
	basis sets when the optimized functions were added to the standard
	correlation consistent basis sets (cc-pVnZ). In the first case, the
	exponents of the augmenting primitive Gaussian functions were optimized
	with respect to the difference between all-electron and valence--electron
	correlated calculations, i.e., for the core--core plus core--valence
	correlation energy. This yielded the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets,
	which are analogous to the sets developed previously for the first
	row atoms [D. E. Woon and T. H. Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 103,
	4572 (1995)]. Although the cc-pCVnZ sets exhibit systematic convergence
	to the all-electron correlation energy at the complete basis set
	limit, the intershell (core--valence) correlation energy converges
	more slowly than the intrashell (core--core) correlation energy.
	Since the effect of including the core electrons on the calculation
	of molecular properties tends to be dominated by core--valence correlation
	effects, a second scheme for determining the augmenting functions
	was investigated. In this approach, the exponents of the functions
	to be added to the cc-pVnZ sets were optimized with respect to just
	the core--valence (intershell) correlation energy, except that a
	small amount of core--core correlation energy was included in order
	to ensure systematic convergence to the complete basis set limit.
	These new sets, denoted weighted core--valence basis sets (cc-pwCVnZ),
	significantly improve the convergence of many molecular properties
	with n. Optimum cc-pwCVnZ sets for the first-row atoms were also
	developed and show similar advantages. Both the cc-pCVnZ and cc-pwCVnZ
	basis sets were benchmarked in coupled cluster [CCSD(T)] calculations
	on a series of second row homonuclear diatomic molecules (Al2, Si2,
	P2, S2, and Cl2), as well as on selected diatomic molecules involving

	Abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the fundamental theory describing
	the interaction of electrons and photons. Its characteristic feature
	is that both radiation and matter are treated quantum mechanically.
	For almost all atomic and molecular systems, which contain bound
	electrons moving at velocities considerably less than that of light,
	a non-relativistic formulation of QED is appropriate. Termed molecular
	QED, its Hamiltonian operator can be constructed by starting from
	the classical Lagrangian function for the interaction of a charged
	particle with a radiation field on applying the variational calculus
	and carrying out the canonical quantization procedure. It is shown
	how the minimal-coupling Lagrangian can be transformed to the chemically
	advantageous multipolar Hamiltonian in which matter couples to radiation
	directly through molecular multipole moments, with the ensuing interaction
	strictly causal. Applications include evaluation of transition rates
	for one- and two-photon absorption, spontaneous and stimulated emission,
	and signal intensities for second- and third-harmonic generation.
	Fundamental intermolecular interactions examined include resonance
	energy transfer, the van der Waals dispersion potential, and the
	change in energy shift of the pair induced by intense external radiation.
	The non-relativistic contribution to the Lamb shift is also extracted.

	Abstract = {A grid-based method designed to refine adiabatic potential energy
	surfaces (PES) of molecules via minimizing a suitable objective function
	is described. The objective function contains deviations from the
	reference (experimental) (ro)-vibrational energy levels and is based
	on PES correction values determined at the grid points within a discrete-variable-representation
	nuclear-motion algorithm and first-order perturbation theory (PT).
	The proposed PES refinement technique is tested on the ground electronic
	state of the MgH molecule. The large number of numerical test results
	obtained suggest the following: (1) first-order PT is able to yield
	accurate correction values at the grid points representing the PES,
	and for practical cases there seems to be no need to go to higher
	orders of PT; (2) with the number of grid points greatly exceeding
	the number of experimental energy levels included in the refinement
	procedure, terms additional to the ``obs-calc{''} term, including
	numerical first and second derivatives of the correction surface,
	are necessary in the objective function to arrive at a physically
	meaningful, ``smooth{''} correction surface; (3) for a given J rotational
	quantum number, the corrected PES is able to reproduce experimental
	(ro)vibrational energies to within tenths of cm(-1) if they are included
	in the refinement or interpolated between states that are involved
	in the optimization, whereas extrapolated states tend to have somewhat
	larger remaining discrepancies; (4) the PES refined only for the
	j = 0 states introduces a minor systematic error for J> 0 states,
	with discrepancies growing with j; (5) when the number of experimental
	energies included in the refinement greatly exceeds the number of
	grid points upon which the PES is optimized, the systematic error
	of treating states with different J rotational quantum numbers can
	be reduced and an impressive average accuracy can be achieved for
	all rovibrational states; and (6) in the case of quasibound (also
	known as resonance) rovibrational states, energies can be computed
	to accuracies similar to those of the bound states and excellent
	lifetimes (widths) can also be determined. Changes in thermochemical
	functions upon inclusion of quasibound states during direct summation

	It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ

@article{07YuThJe.method,
	Abstract = {We present a new computational method with associated computer program
	TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies) to perform variational
	calculations of rovibrational energies for general polyatomic molecules
	of arbitrary structure in isolated electronic states. The (approximate)
	nuclear kinetic energy operator is represented as an expansion in
	terms of internal coordinates. The main feature of the computational
	scheme is a numerical construction of the kinetic energy operator,
	which is an integral part of the computation process. Thus the scheme
	is self-contained, i.e., it requires no analytical pre-derivation
	of the kinetic energy operator. It is also general, since it can
	be used in connection with any internal coordinates. The method represents
	an extension of our model for pyramidal XY3 molecules reported previously
	{[}S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal, P. Jensen, H. Lin, J.J. Zheng, W.
	Thiel, Mol. Phys. 103 (2005) 359]. Non-rigid molecules are treated
	in the Hougen-Bunker-Johns approach {[}J.T. Hougen, P.R. Bunker,
	J.W.C. Johns, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 34 (1970) 136]. In this case, the
	variational calculations employ a numerical finite basis representation
	for the large-amplitude motion using basis functions that are generated
	by Numerov-Cooley integration of the appropriate one-dimensional
	Schrodinger equation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
