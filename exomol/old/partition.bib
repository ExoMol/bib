   complete the partition sum data needed for additional isotopologues in
   HITRAN2008 and also extend the partition sums to molecules of
   astrophysical interest. These data, at 25 K steps, are incorporated into
   a FORTRAN code (TIPS\_2011.for) that can be used to rapidly generate the
   data at any temperature in the range 70-3000 K.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{416-438}},
Abstract = {{Accurate molecular partition functions are required to determine both
   thermodynamic properties for equilibrium and nonequilibrium flow field
   calculations, and energy level populations for radiative heat transfer
   in high enthalpy flows, for instance. Thermodynamic functions of
   diatomic molecules are computed in this study at high temperatures and
   for nonequilibrium media in the framework of multi-temperature models.
   Partition functions, average energies, and specific heats of N(2),
   N(2)(+), NO, O(2), CN, C(2), CO, and CO(+) are calculated up to 50,000 K
   by direct summation over energy levels using recent and accurate
   spectroscopic data and dissociation energy values. Estimates are made
   for the error introduced by neglecting the highest considered electronic
   states. For nonequilibrium media, the sensitivity of the
   multi-temperature thermodynamic functions to different schemes for
   energy partitioning is discussed. In particular, the effects of
   vibration-rotation coupling are investigated. The tabulated results are
   available upon request.}},
