Jet-cooled spectra of 14NH3 and 15NH3 in natural abundance were recorded using cavity
ring-down (CRDS, 6584–6670 cm−1) and cavity enhanced absorption (CEAS, 6530–6700 cm−1)
spectroscopy. Line broadening effects in the CRDS spectrum allowed lines with J″-values
between 0 and 3 to be identified. Intensity ratios in 14NH3 between the jet-cooled CRDS
and literature room-temperature data from Sung et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat.
Transfer, 113 (2012), 1066) further assisted the line assignments. Ground state
combination differences were extensively used to support the assignments, providing
reliable values for J, K and inversion symmetry of the ground state vibrational levels.
CEAS data helped in this respect for the lowest J lines, some of which are saturated in
the CRDS spectrum. Further information on a/s doublets arose from the observed spectral
structures. Thirty-two transitions of 14NH3 were assigned in this way and a limited but
significant number (19) of changes in the assignments results, compared to Sung et al. or
to Cacciani et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113 (2012), 1084). Sixteen
known and 25 new low-J transitions were identified for 15NH3 in the CRDS spectrum but the
much scarcer literature information did not allow for any more refined assignment. The
present line position measurements improve on literature values published for 15NH3 and
on some line positions for 14NH3. }
