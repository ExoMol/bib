Abstract = {Results of a theoretical study of the atomic and electronic structure of
   the hydrogen molecule in the crystalline silicon matrix are presented.
   An analytical expression for the rotational potential energy function of
   the interstitial hydrogen molecule in the crystal at the tetrahedral
   position is derived. The rotational terms and the corresponding
   wavefunctions as well as the ortho-para splitting of the Raman spectral
   lines are calculated. It is shown that the interstitial hydrogen states
   with l < 2 can be treated within the framework of the free molecule
   approach; however, a noticeable splitting of the rotational terms with l
   a parts per thousand yen 2 indicates a substantial influence of the
   semiconductor matrix on the properties of the system.},

Abstract = {The data incorporated in the HITRAN database for (NH3)-N-14 are analyzed
   using a comprehensive and consistent set of quantum numbers, empirical
   lower energy levels and the BYTe variationally calculated line list as
   reference points. Labelings are checked to ensure that they obey both
   the usual selection rules and the HITRAN labeling formalisms; the
   problems identified are corrected where possible. Further assignments
   are brought into question by combination difference (CD) checking of
   implied upper energy levels. The CD analysis yields an 89\% complete
   (NH3)-N-14 energy level list up to 6610 cm(-1) and J=21, self-consistent
   to 0.1 cm(-1). In combination with the 1723 previously unassigned and
   unlabeled lines in HITRAN a total of 2529 problem lines were identified
   for re-analysis. The compiled energy level list was used to label and
   assign the set of problem transitions, resulting in a total of 249 new
   assignments and a further 368 new labelings. Assignment by comparison
   with the reference line list resulted in 111 further new line
   assignments and 14 new labelings. Intensities are checked against recent
   measurements and BYTe. New intensities are proposed for the nu(2) band
   with new intensities and line positions for the 2 nu(2)-nu(2) and new
   line lists are created for the nu(2)-nu(2), nu(2)-nu(4) and nu(4)-nu(4)
   bands. BYTe band intensities are analyzed to identify other regions of

Abstract = {Pure rotational transitions of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in its ground and

   The spectrum comprises an average of 1020 scans at 0.005 cm(-1)
   resolution recorded in the region 45-360 cm(-1) (1.4 to 10.5 THz) with a
   globar continuum source using a Fourier transform spectrometer located
   at the AILES beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. Over 2400 rotational
   lines have been detected belonging to ground vibrational state
   transitions of the four isotopologues (H2S)-S-32, (H2S)-S-33,
   (H2S)-S-34, and (H2S)-S-36 observed in natural abundance. 65\% of these
   lines are recorded and assigned for the first time, sampling levels as
   high as J=26 and K-a=17 for (H2S)-S-32. 320 pure rotational transitions
   of (H2S)-S-32 in its first excited bending vibrational state are
   recorded and analysed for the first time and 86 transitions for
   (H2S)-S-34, where some of these transitions belong to new experimental
   energy levels. Rotational constants have been fitted for all the
   isotopologues in both vibrational states using a standard effective
   Hamiltonian approach. Comprehensive comparisons are made with previously
   available data as well as the data available in HITRAN, CDMS, and JPL

Abstract = {Exoplanets, and in particular hot ones such as hot Jupiters, require
   very significant quantities of molecular spectroscopic data to model
   radiative transport in their atmospheres or to interpret their spectra.
   This data is commonly provided in the form of very extensive transition
   line lists. The size of these line lists is such that constructing a
   single model may require the consideration of several billion lines. We
   present a procedure to simplify this process based on the use of cross
   sections. Line lists for water, HI, HCN/HNC and ammonia have been turned
   into cross sections on a fine enough grid to preserve their
   spectroscopic features. Cross sections are provided at a fixed range of
   temperatures and an interpolation procedure which can be used to
   generate cross sections at arbitrary temperatures is described. A
   web-based interface (www.exomol.com/xsecs) has been developed to allow
   astronomers to download cross sections at specified temperatures and
   spectral resolution. Specific examples are presented for water and

Abstract = {Results are presented for highly accurate ab initio variational
   calculation of the rotation vibration energy levels of H2O2 in its

   energy surface and the variational nuclear-motion programs WARV4, which
   uses an exact kinetic energy operator, and TROVE, which uses a numerical
   expansion for the kinetic energy. The TROVE calculations are performed
   for levels with high values of rotational excitation, J up to 35. The
   purely ab initio calculations of the rovibrational energy levels
   reproduce the observed levels with a standard deviation of about 1
   cm(-1), similar to that of the J = 0 calculation, because the
   discrepancy between theory and experiment for rotational energies within
   a given vibrational state is substantially determined by the error in
   the vibrational band origin. Minor adjustments are made to the ab initio
   equilibrium geometry and to the height of the torsional barrier. Using
   these and correcting the band origins using the error in J = 0 states
   lowers the standard deviation of the observed-calculated energies to
   only 0.002 cm(-1) for levels up to J = 10 and 0.02 cm(-1) for all

   developed previously (Marquardt, R.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109,

   electronic energies from ab initio calculations using the coupled
   cluster method with single and double substitutions and a perturbative
   treatment of connected triple excitations (CCSD(T)) and the method of
   multireference configuration interaction (MRCI). CCSD(T) data were
   obtained from an extrapolation of aug-cc-pVXZ results to the basis set
   limit (CBS), as described in a previous work (Yurchenko, S.N.; et al. J.
   Chem. Phys 2005, 123, 134308); they cover the region around the NH3
   equilibrium structures up to 20 000 hc cm(-1). MRCI energies were
   computed using the aug-cc-pVQZ basis to describe both low lying singlet
   dissociation channels. Adjustment was performed simultaneously to
   energies obtained from the different ab initio methods using a merging
   strategy that includes 10 000 geometries at the CCSD(T) level and 500
   geometries at the MRCI level. Characteristic features of this improved

Abstract = {We report near-infrared measurements of the terminator region
   transmission spectrum and dayside emission spectrum of the exoplanet
   WASP-12b obtained using the HST WFC3 instrument. The disk-average
   dayside brightness temperature averages about 2900 K, peaking to 3200 K
   around 1.46 mu m. We modeled a range of atmospheric cases for both the
   emission and transmission spectrum and confirm the recent finding by
   Crossfield et al. (Crossfield, L, Barman, T., Hansen, B., Tanaka, I.,
   Kodama, T. {[}2012b]. arXiv: 1210.4836C) that there is no evidence for
   C/O > 1 in the atmosphere of WASP-12b. Assuming a physically plausible
   atmosphere, we find evidence that the presence of a number of molecules
   is consistent with the data, but the justification for inclusion of
   these opacity sources based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
   is marginal. We also find the near-infrared primary eclipse light curve
   is consistent with small amounts of prolate distortion. As part of the
   calibration effort for these data, we conducted a detailed study of
   instrument systematics using 65 orbits of WFC3-IR grims observations.
   The instrument systematics are dominated by detector-related affects,
   which vary significantly depending on the detector readout mode. The 256
   x 256 subarray observations of WASP-12 produced spectral measurements
   within 15\% of the photon-noise limit using a simple calibration
   approach. Residual systematics are estimated to be <= 70 ppm. (C) 2013

Abstract = {An accurate and comprehensive room temperature rotation-vibration

   noise is statistically independent from the desired light-curve signals
   is presented. By not assuming any prior or auxiliary information but the
   data themselves, it is shown that spectroscopic errors only about
   10\%-30\% larger than parametric methods can be obtained for 11 spectral
   bins with bin sizes of similar to 0.09 mu m. This represents a
   reasonable trade-off between a higher degree of objectivity for the
   non-parametric methods and smaller standard errors for the parametric
   de-trending. Results are discussed in light of previous analyses
   published in the literature. The fact that three very different analysis
   techniques yield comparable spectra is a strong indication of the
   stability of these results.},

Abstract = {At elevated temperatures the spectra of polyatomic molecules become
   extremely complicated with millions, or even billions, of transitions
   potentially playing an important role. The atmospheres of cool stars and
   ``hot Jupiter{''} extrasolar planets are rich with molecules in the
   temperature range 1000 to 3000 K and their properties are strongly
   influenced by the infrared and visible spectra of these molecules.
   Access to extensive lists of transitions is essential for interpreting
   even the rather simple spectra that can be obtained from exoplanets. So
   far there are extensive, reliable lists of spectral lines for a number
   species including some stable diatomics, water and ammonia. Data are
   almost completely lacking for many key species such as methane. The
   ExoMol project aims to construct line lists of molecular transitions
   suitable for spectroscopic and atmospheric modelling of cool stars and
   exoplanets. At high temperatures it is necessary to consider huge
   numbers of lines even for a single species. Examples of line lists are
   given; data protocols defined and data handling issues which arise from
   trying to distribute these huge datasets discussed. In particular, a
   uniform but flexible format is given for the representation of line
   lists and cross sections resulting from the ExoMol project.},

Abstract = {Ab initio potential energy and dipole moment surfaces are computed for
   sulfur trioxide (SO3) at the CCSD(T)-F12b level of theory with
   appropriate triple-zeta basis sets. The analytical representations of
   these surfaces are used, with a slight correction, to compute pure
   rotational and rotation-vibration spectra of (SO3)-S-32-O-16 using the
   variational nuclear motion program TROVE. The calculations considered
   transitions in the region 0-4000 cm(-1) with rotational states up to J =
   85. The resulting line list of 174 674 257 transitions is appropriate
   for modelling room temperature (SO3)-S-32-O-16 spectra. Good agreement
   is found with the observed infrared absorption spectra and the
   calculations are used to place the measured relative intensities on an
   absolute scale. A list of 10 878 experimental transitions is provided in
   a form suitable for inclusion in standard atmospheric and planetary
   spectroscopic databases.},

Abstract = {This contribution lays out the scientific foundations of the project
   ExoMol. This project will produce molecular line lists for all molecules
   considered to be important for the modelling atmospheres of exoplanets
   and cool stars, which are prerequisites for the spectroscopic
   characterization of the atmospheres of these astrophysical objects.
   Towards this end 25 species are identified as key ones for meeting
   current demands for atmospheric models of exoplanets and brown dwarfs,
   impeded by the lack of fundamental data on the absorption of these
   species. The production of comprehensive and very large
   rotation-vibration and rotation-vibration-electronic line lists requires
   a mixture of first principles quantum mechanical methods and empirical
   tuning based on laboratory spectroscopic data. ExoMol will rely on these
   methodologies and make extensive use of state-of-the-art computing.},
