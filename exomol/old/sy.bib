  abstract = {This is a continuation of our earlier work aimed at predicting the
	millimeterwave spectrum of protonated methane CH5+. As for protonated
	acetylene C2H3+, it is the millimeterwave spectrum that will most
	directly provide the experimental information needed to understand
	the large amplitude motion of the molecule. Literature ab initio
	calculations show that the large amplitude motion of the five protons
	around the central carbon nucleus in CH is not completely free, but
	is restricted by potential barriers at the trigonal bipyramid (D-3h),
	square pyramid (C-4v) and end-on-H-2 (C-3v) forms. Thus, the large
	amplitude motion proceeds mostly in the coordinate space that connects
	the structures called C-s(I), C-s(II) and C-2v. These structures
	have essentially identical electronic energies and very similar rotational
	constants, as has already been shown in the literature. We calculate
	that they also have very similar dipole moments. The topology of

	high resolution gas phase millimeterwave absorption spectrum of CH5+.

	220-235 GHz, and if all the large amplitude motion splittings of
	this line are resolved, the strongest component (the K-i = 0 <--
	0 line) is predicted to have an integrated absorption intensity of
	13 m/mol at 77 K. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The science of extra-solar planets is one of the most rapidly changing
	areas of astrophysics and since 1995 the number of planets known
	has increased by almost two orders of magnitude. A combination of
	ground-based surveys and dedicated space missions has resulted in
	560-plus planets being detected, and over 1200 that await confirmation.
	NASA's Kepler mission has opened up the possibility of discovering
	Earth-like planets in the habitable zone around some of the 100,000
	stars it is surveying during its 3 to 4-year lifetime. The new ESA's
	Gain mission is expected to discover thousands of new planets around
	stars within 200 parsecs of the Sun. The key challenge now is moving
	on from discovery, important though that remains, to characterisation:
	what are these planets actually like, and why are they as they are?
	In the past ten years, we have learned how to obtain the first spectra
	of exoplanets using transit transmission and emission spectroscopy.
	With the high stability of Spitzer, Hubble, and large ground-based
	telescopes the spectra of bright close-in massive planets can be
	obtained and species like water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide
	and dioxide have been detected. With transit science came the first
	tangible remote sensing of these planetary bodies and so one can
	start to extrapolate from what has been learnt from Solar System
	probes to what one might plan to learn about their faraway siblings.
	As we learn more about the atmospheres, surfaces and near-surfaces
	of these remote bodies, we will begin to build up a clearer picture
	of their construction, history and suitability for life. The Exoplanet
	Characterisation Observatory, EChO, will be the first dedicated mission
	to investigate the physics and chemistry of Exoplanetary Atmospheres.
	By characterising spectroscopically more bodies in different environments
	we will take detailed planetology out of the Solar System and into
	the Galaxy as a whole. EChO has now been selected by the European
	Space Agency to be assessed as one of four M3 mission candidates.},

  abstract = {A dedicated mission to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres represents
	a major milestone in our quest to understand our place in the universe
	by placing our Solar System in context and by addressing the suitability
	of planets for the presence of life. EChO-the Exoplanet Characterisation
	Observatory-is a mission concept specifically geared for this purpose.
	EChO will provide simultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations
	on a stable platform that will allow very long exposures. The use
	of passive cooling, few moving parts and well established technology
	gives a low-risk and potentially long-lived mission. EChO will build
	on observations by Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based telescopes, which
	discovered the first molecules and atoms in exoplanetary atmospheres.
	However, EChO's configuration and specifications are designed to
	study a number of systems in a consistent manner that will eliminate
	the ambiguities affecting prior observations. EChO will simultaneously
	observe a broad enough spectral region-from the visible to the mid-infrared-to
	constrain from one single spectrum the temperature structure of the
	atmosphere, the abundances of the major carbon and oxygen bearing
	species, the expected photochemically-produced species and magnetospheric
	signatures. The spectral range and resolution are tailored to separate
	bands belonging to up to 30 molecules and retrieve the composition
	and temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list
	for EChO includes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium
	temperatures T (eq) up to 2,000 K, to those of a few Earth masses,
	with T (eq) \textbackslash{}u223c 300 K. The list will include planets
	with no Solar System analog, such as the recently discovered planets
	GJ1214b, whose density lies between that of terrestrial and gaseous
	planets, or the rocky-iron planet 55 Cnc e, with day-side temperature
	close to 3,000 K. As the number of detected exoplanets is growing
	rapidly each year, and the mass and radius of those detected steadily
	decreases, the target list will be constantly adjusted to include
	the most interesting systems. We have baselined a dispersive spectrograph
	design covering continuously the 0.4-16 mu m spectral range in 6
	channels (1 in the visible, 5 in the InfraRed), which allows the
	spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,
	depending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted
	behind a 1.5 m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the
	instrument structure and optics passively cooled to \textbackslash{}u223c45
	K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit around L2. This orbit,
	in combination with an optimised thermal shield design, provides
	a highly stable thermal environment and a high degree of visibility
	of the sky to observe repeatedly several tens of targets over the
	year. Both the baseline and alternative designs have been evaluated
	and no critical items with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) less
	than 4-5 have been identified. We have also undertaken a first-order

Abstract = {Hot methane spectra are important in environments ranging from flames to
   the atmospheres of cool stars and exoplanets. A new spectroscopic line
   list, 10to10, for (CH4)-C-12 containing almost 10 billion transitions is
   presented. This comprehensive line list covers a broad spectroscopic
   range and is applicable for temperatures up to 1,500 K. Previous methane
   data are incomplete, leading to underestimated opacities at short
   wavelengths and elevated temperatures. Use of 10to10 in models of the
   bright T4.5 brown dwarf 2MASS 0559-14 leads to significantly better
   agreement with observations and in studies of the hot Jupiter exoplanet
   HD 189733b leads to up to a 20-fold increase in methane abundance. It is
   demonstrated that proper inclusion of the huge increase in hot
   transitions which are important at elevated temperatures is crucial for
   accurate characterizations of atmospheres of brown dwarfs and
   exoplanets, especially when observed in the near-infrared.},
