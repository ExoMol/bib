Title = {ÆSOPUS 2.1: Low-temperature Opacities Extended to High Pressure},
Journal = {ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {976},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {We address the critical need for accurate Rosseland mean gas opacities
   in high-pressure environments, spanning temperatures from 100 K to 32000
   K. Current opacity tables from Wichita State University and AESOPUS 2.0
   are limited to log(R)<= 1, where R=rho T-6(-3) in units of
   gcm-3(10(6)K)(-3). This is insufficient for modeling very low-mass
   stars, brown dwarfs, and planets with atmospheres exhibiting higher
   densities and pressures (log(R)>1). Leveraging extensive databases such
   as ExoMol, ExoMolOP, MoLLIST, and HITEMP, we focus on expanding the
   AESOPUS opacity calculations to cover a broad range of pressure and
   density conditions (-8 <= log(R)<=+6). We incorporate the thermal
   Doppler mechanism and micro-turbulence velocity. Pressure broadening
   effects on molecular transitions, leading to Lorentzian or Voigt
   profiles, are explored in the context of atmospheric profiles for
   exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stars. We also delve into the
   impact of electron degeneracy and non-ideal effects such as ionization
   potential depression under high-density conditions, emphasizing its
   notable influence on Rosseland mean opacities at temperatures exceeding
   10,000 K. As a result, this study expands AESOPUS public web interface
   for customized gas chemical mixtures, promoting flexibility in opacity
   calculations based on specific research needs. Additionally,
   pre-computed opacity tables, inclusive of condensates, are provided. We
   present a preliminary application to evolutionary models for very
   low-mass stars.},

Title = {Modeling Atmospheric Lines by the Exoplanet Community (MALBEC) Version
   1.0: A CUISINES Radiative Transfer Intercomparison Project},
Journal = {PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Radiative transfer (RT) models are critical in the interpretation of
   exoplanetary spectra, in simulating exoplanet climates, and when
   designing the specifications of future flagship observatories. However,
   most models differ in methodologies and input data, which can lead to
   significantly different spectra. In this paper, we present the
   experimental protocol of the Modeling Atmospheric Lines By the Exoplanet
   Community (MALBEC) project. MALBEC is an exoplanet model intercomparison
   project that belongs to the Climates Using Interactive Suites of
   Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies framework, which aims to
   provide the exoplanet community with a large and diverse set of
   comparison and validation of models. The proposed protocol tests include
   a large set of initial participating RT models, a broad range of
   atmospheres (from hot Jupiters to temperate terrestrials), and several
   observation geometries, which would allow us to quantify and compare the
   differences between different RT models used by the exoplanetary
   community. Two types of tests are proposed: transit spectroscopy and
   direct imaging modeling, with results from the proposed tests to be
   published in dedicated follow-up papers. To encourage the community to
   join this comparison effort and as an example, we present simulation
   results for one specific transit case (GJ-1214 b), in which we find
   notable differences in how the various codes handle the discretization
   of the atmospheres (e.g., sub-layering), the treatment of molecular
   opacities (e.g., correlated-k, line-by-line) and the default
   spectroscopic repositories generally used by each model (e.g., HITRAN,
   HITEMP, ExoMol).},

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {This work introduces new low-temperature gas opacities in the range 3.2
   < log(T/K) < 4.5 computed with the ae SOPUS code under the assumption of
   thermodynamic equilibrium. In comparison to the previous version, ae
   SOPUS 1.0, we updated and expanded molecular absorption to include 80
   species, mostly using the recommended line lists currently available
   from the ExoMol and HITRAN databases. Furthermore, in light of a recent
   study, we revised the H- photodetachment cross section, added the
   free-free absorption of other negative ions of atoms and molecules, and
   updated the collision-induced absorption due to H-2/H-2, H-2/H, H2/He,
   and H/ He pairs. Using the new input physics, we computed tables of
   Rosseland mean opacities for several scaled-solar chemical compositions,
   including Magg et al.'s most recent one, as well as alpha-enhanced
   mixtures. The differences in opacity between the new ae SOPUS 2.0 and
   the original ae SOPUS 1.0 versions, as well as other sets of
   calculations, are discussed. The new opacities are released to the
   community via a dedicated webpage that includes both precomputed tables
   for widely used chemical compositions and a web interface for
   calculating opacities on the fly for any abundance distribution.},

Title = {An Open-source Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (BART) Code. II.
   The Transit Radiative Transfer Module and Retrieval of HAT-P-11b},
Journal = {PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL},

Abstract = {This and companion papers by Harrington et al. and Blecic et al. present
   the Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (bart) code, an open-source,
   open-development package to characterize extrasolar planet atmospheres.
   bart combines a thermochemical equilibrium abundance (tea), a radiative
   transfer (Transit), and a Bayesian statistical (mc3) module to constrain
   atmospheric temperatures and molecular abundances for given
   spectroscopic observations. Here we describe the Transit radiative
   transfer package, an efficient line-by-line radiative transfer C code
   for one-dimensional atmospheres, developed by P. Rojo and further
   modified by the UCF exoplanet group. This code produces transmission and
   hemisphere-integrated emission spectra. Transit handles line-by-line
   opacities from HITRAN, Partridge \& Schwenke (H2O), Schwenke (TiO), and
   Plez (VO) and collision-induced absorption from Borysow, HITRAN, and
   ExoMol. Transit emission spectra models agree with models from C. Morley
   (private communication) within a few percent. We applied bart to the
   Spitzer and Hubble transit observations of the Neptune-sized planet
   HAT-P-11b. Our analysis of the combined HST and Spitzer data generally
   agrees with those from previous studies, finding atmospheric models with
   enhanced metallicity (?100x solar) and high-altitude clouds (?1 mbar
   level). When analyzing only the HST data, our models favor
   high-metallicity atmospheres, in contrast with the previous analysis by
   Chachan et al. We suspect that this discrepancy arises from the
   different choice of chemistry modeling (free constant-with-altitude
   versus thermochemical equilibrium) and the enhanced parameter
   correlations found when neglecting the Spitzer observations.},

Abstract = {Stellar, substellar, and planetary atmosphere models are all highly
   sensitive to the input opacities. Generational differences between
   various state-of-the-art stellar/planetary models arise primarily
   because of incomplete and outdated atomic/molecular line lists. Here we
   present a database of precomputed absorption cross sections for all
   isotopologues of key atmospheric molecules relevant to late-type
   stellar, brown dwarf, and planetary atmospheres: MgH, AlH, CaH, TiH,
   CrH, FeH, SiO, TiO, VO, and H2O. The pressure and temperature ranges of
   the computed opacities are 10(-6)-3000 bar and 75-4000 K, and their
   spectral ranges are 0.25-330 mu m for many cases where possible. For
   cases with no pressure-broadening data, we use collision theory to
   bridge the gap. We also probe the effect of absorption cross sections
   calculated from different line lists in the context of ultrahot Jupiter
   and M-dwarf atmospheres. Using 1D self-consistent radiative-convective
   thermochemical equilibrium models, we report significant variations in
   the theoretical spectra and thermal profiles of substellar atmospheres.
   With a 2000 K representative ultrahot Jupiter, we report variations of
   up to 320 and 80 ppm in transmission and thermal emission spectra,
   respectively. For a 3000 K M-dwarf, we find differences of up to 125\%
   in the spectra. We find that the most significant differences arise as a
   result of the choice of TiO line lists, primarily below 1 mu m. In
   summary, (1) we present a database of precomputed molecular absorption
   cross sections, and (2) we quantify biases that arise when
   characterizing substellar/exoplanet atmospheres as a result of
   differences in the line lists, therefore highlighting the importance of
   correct and complete opacities for eventual applications to
   high-precision spectroscopy and photometry.},

Abstract = {Computing and using opacities is a key part of modeling and interpreting
   data of exoplanetary atmospheres. Since the underlying spectroscopic
   line lists are constantly expanding and currently include up to similar
   to 10(10)-10(11) transition lines, the opacity calculator codes need to
   become more powerful. Here we present major upgrades to the HELIOS-K
   GPU-accelerated opacity calculator and describe the necessary steps to
   process large line lists within a reasonable amount of time. Besides
   performance improvements, we include more capabilities and present a
   toolbox for handling different atomic and molecular data sets, from
   downloading and preprocessing the data to performing the opacity
   calculations in a user-friendly way. HELIOS-K supports line lists from
   ExoMol, HITRAN, HITEMP, NIST, Kurucz, and VALD3. By matching the
   resolution of 0.1 cm(-1) and cutting length of 25 cm(-1) used by the
   ExoCross code for timing performance (251 s excluding data read-in
   time), HELIOS-K can process the ExoMol BT2 water line list in 12.5 s.
   Using a resolution of 0.01 cm(-1), it takes 45 s, equivalent to about
   10(7) lines s(-1). As a wavenumber resolution of 0.01 cm(-1) suffices
   for most exoplanetary atmosphere spectroscopic calculations, we adopt
   this resolution in calculating opacity functions for several hundred
   atomic and molecular species and make them freely available on the
   open-access DACE database. For the opacity calculations of the database,
   we use a cutting length of 100 cm(-1) for molecules and no cutting
   length for atoms. Our opacities are available for downloading from and
   may be visualized using .},

Abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) has been used to detect a number of
   species in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Key to such detections is
   accurately and precisely modelled spectra for cross-correlation against
   the R greater than or similar to 20 000 observations. There is a need
   for the latest generation of opacities which form the basis for high
   signal-to-noise detections using such spectra. In this study we present
   and make publicly available cross-sections for six molecular species,
   H2O, CO, HCN, CH4, NH3, and CO2 using the latest line lists most
   suitable for low- and high-resolution spectroscopy. We focus on the
   infrared (0.95-5 mu m) and between 500 and 1500 K where these species
   have strong spectral signatures. We generate these cross-sections on a
   grid of pressures and temperatures typical for the photospheres of
   super-Earth, warm Neptunes, and hot Jupiters using the latest H-2 and He
   pressure broadening. We highlight the most prominent infrared spectral
   features by modelling three representative exoplanets, GJ 1214 b, GJ
   3470 b, and HD 189733 b, which encompass a wide range in temperature,
   mass, and radii. In addition, we verify the line lists for H2O, CO, and
   HCN with previous high-resolution observations of hot Jupiters. However,
   we are unable to detect CH4 with our new cross-sections from HRS
   observations of HD 102195 b. These high-accuracy opacities are critical
   for atmospheric detections with HRS and will be continually updated as
   new data become available.},

Abstract = {To study the complexity of hot Jupiter atmospheres revealed by
   observations of increasing quality, we have adapted the UK Met Office
   Global Circulation Model (GCM), the Unified Model (UM), to these
   exoplanets. The UM solves the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations with a
   height-varying gravity, avoiding the simplifications used in most GCMs
   currently applied to exoplanets. In this work we present the coupling of
   the UM dynamical core to an accurate radiation scheme based on the
   two-stream approximation and correlated-k method with state-of-the-art
   opacities from ExoMol. Our first application of this model is devoted to
   the extensively studied hot Jupiter HD 209458b. We have derived
   synthetic emission spectra and phase curves, and compare them to both
   previous models also based on state-of-the-art radiative transfer, and
   to observations. We find a reasonable agreement between observations and
   both our days side emission and hot spot offset, however, our night side
   emissions is too large. Overall our results are qualitatively similar to
   those found by Showman et al. (2009, ApJ, 699, 564) with the
   SPARC/MITgcm, however, we note several quantitative differences: Our
   simulations show significant variation in the position of the hottest
   part of the atmosphere with pressure, as expected from simple timescale
   arguments, and in contrast to the ``vertical coherency{''} found by
   Showman et al. (2009). We also see significant quantitative differences
   in calculated synthetic observations. Our comparisons strengthen the
   need for detailed intercomparisons of dynamical cores, radiation schemes
   and post-processing tools to understand these differences. This effort
   is necessary in order to make robust conclusions about these atmospheres
   based on GCM results.},
