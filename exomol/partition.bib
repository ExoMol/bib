Volume = {134},
Abstract = {The partition function, U, the number of available states in an atom or
   molecules, is crucial for understanding the physical state of any
   astrophysical system in thermodynamic equilibrium. There are
   surprisingly few useful discussions of the partition function's
   numerical value. Textbooks often define U; some give tables of
   representative values, while others do a deep dive into the theory of
   dense plasma. Most say that it depends on temperature, atomic structure,
   density, and that it diverges, that is, it goes to infinity, at high
   temperatures, but few give practical examples. We aim to rectify this.
   We show that there are two limits, one- and two-electron (or
   closed-shell) systems like H or He, and species with a complicated
   electronic structure like C, N, O, and Fe. The high-temperature
   divergence does not occur for one- and two-electron systems in practical
   situations because, at high temperatures, species are collisionally
   ionized to higher-ionization stages and are not abundant. The partition
   function is then close to the statistical weight of the ground state.
   There is no such simplification for many-electron species. U is
   temperature sensitive across the range of temperatures where an ion is
   abundant but remains finite at even the highest practical temperatures.
   The actual value depends on highly uncertain truncation theories in
   high-density plasmas. We show that there are various theories for
   continuum lowering but that they are not in good agreement. This remains
   a long-standing unsolved problem.},
