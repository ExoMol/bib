Abstract = {{The molecular partition functions of even the simplest molecules are
   uncertain at high temperatures. This paper presents an investigation of
   the existing discrepancies for the H-2(+) molecular ion. The specific
   aim, apart from a comparison of various results, is to include all
   interactions between atoms in the molecular partition function to obtain
   those values which can be called the ideal-gas partition function. A
   classical mechanics-based method is used, and to extend the results to
   temperatures below 7000 K the Wigner-Kirkwood quantum correction is
   applied. Analysis of the results of this paper and others shows
   significant differences from the results currently known in the field of
   molecular physics and those used in the field of astrophysics.}},

Title = {{A formula for the contribution of a resonance to the canonical partition
   function}},
Journal = MP,
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {1964-1970},
Abstract = {{An explicit expression for the Laplace transform of a Lorentzian
   function is applied to evaluate the contribution to the canonical
   partition function of ideal-gas molecules stemming from resonances. This
   formula can be used instead of numerical integration. A discussion of
   potential errors in replacing this contribution by the conventional
   formula for the Boltzmann weight is given. When generalised to the
   complex plane, the known expression is shown to be discontinuous and a
   new formulation is proposed that removes the discontinuity. As a result,
   an explicit expression is obtained for the Fourier transform of a
   Lorentzian function that is truncated at a lower energy bound.}},

Title = {{Toward accurate thermochemistry of the (MgH)-Mg-24, (MgH)-Mg-25, and
   (MgH)-Mg-26 molecules at elevated temperatures: Corrections due to
   unbound states}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Abstract = {{The total partition functions Q (T) and their first two moments Q' (T)
   and Q `' (T), together with the isobaric heat capacities C-p (T), are
   computed a priori for three major MgH isotopologues on the temperature
   range of T = 100-3000 K using the recent highly accurate potential
   energy curve, spin-rotation, and non-adiabatic correction functions of
   Henderson et al. {[}J. Phys. Chem. A 117, 13373 (2013)]. Nuclear motion
   computations are carried out on the ground electronic state to determine
   the (ro) vibrational energy levels and the scattering phase shifts. The
   effect of resonance states is found to be significant above about 1000 K
   and it increases with temperature. Even very short-lived states, due to
   their relatively large number, have significant contributions to Q (T)
   at elevated temperatures. The contribution of scattering states is
   around one fourth of that of resonance states but opposite in sign.
   Uncertainty estimates are given for the possible error sources,
   suggesting that all computed thermochemical properties have an accuracy
   better than 0.005\% up to 1200 K. Between 1200 and 2500 K, the
   uncertainties can rise to around 0.1\%, while between 2500 K and 3000 K,
   a further increase to 0.5\% might be observed for Q `' (T) and Cp (T),
   principally due to the neglect of excited electronic states. The
   accurate thermochemical data determined are presented in the
   supplementary material for the three isotopologues of (MgH)-Mg-24,
   (MgH)-Mg-25, and (MgH)-Mg-26 at 1 K increments. These data, which differ
   significantly from older standard data, should prove useful for
   astronomical models incorporating thermodynamic properties of these
   species.}},

   Data of Diatomic Molecules}},
Journal = {Int. J. Thermophys.},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{416-438}},
Abstract = {{Accurate molecular partition functions are required to determine both
   thermodynamic properties for equilibrium and nonequilibrium flow field
   calculations, and energy level populations for radiative heat transfer
   in high enthalpy flows, for instance. Thermodynamic functions of
   diatomic molecules are computed in this study at high temperatures and
   for nonequilibrium media in the framework of multi-temperature models.
   Partition functions, average energies, and specific heats of N(2),
   N(2)(+), NO, O(2), CN, C(2), CO, and CO(+) are calculated up to 50,000 K
   by direct summation over energy levels using recent and accurate
   spectroscopic data and dissociation energy values. Estimates are made
   for the error introduced by neglecting the highest considered electronic
   states. For nonequilibrium media, the sensitivity of the
   multi-temperature thermodynamic functions to different schemes for
   energy partitioning is discussed. In particular, the effects of
   vibration-rotation coupling are investigated. The tabulated results are
   available upon request.}},
