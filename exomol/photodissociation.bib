Title = {{Photodissociation cross sections of BeH+ in ultraviolet band}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{254}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical studies of photodissociation cross sections of the beryllium
   monohydride cation BeH+ are reported. Explicit photodissociation cross
   sections are computed for transitions from its ground electronic state
   X-1 Sigma(+) to excited ones A(1)Sigma(+), B-1 Pi and C-1 Sigma(+)
   respectively. Partial cross sections are computed for nearly the full
   range of rovibrational levels of the X-1 Sigma(+) state and for photon
   wavelengths ranging from 70 nm to threshold. Photodissociation cross
   sections are presented at temperatures of 1800K, 4500K, 10000K and
   20000K as examples, where a Boltzmann distribution of initial
   rovibrational levels is assumed. This paper provides the complementary
   photodissociation cross sections following the bound-bound transition of
   previous work for BeH+ {[}7]. The results are applicable to the
   photodissociation of BeH+ in the early universe and in a variety of
   ultraviolet (UV) irradiated interstellar environments, which is of great
   importance to the modelling of features of interstellar observations as
   well as the fusion plasma emissions in the edge and divertor region. }},

	abstract = {Photochemistry has the potential to substantially impact the atmospheric composition of exoplanets with consequences on the radiative transfer, thermal structure, and dynamics of the atmospheres, particularly in UV-rich stellar environments. Here, we present the results of a first laboratory experimental simulation of photochemistry in carbon-rich exoplanet atmospheres at elevated temperatures. The evolution of gas-phase molecular composition was quantitatively monitored with infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We found that H2/CO gas compositions can change significantly from thermal equilibria compositions when irradiated with Lyα photons at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1500 K. Carbon dioxide and water were found to be the main products caused by photolysis, while the formation of methane was also observed to a lesser extent. We find that photochemistry efficiency is strongly correlated with increasing temperature. Our finding that water is efficiently produced by photochemistry in a supersolar C/O = 1 environment, representing C enhancement relative to solar values C/O ratio = 0.54, has significant implications for the interpretation of many exoplanet transmission spectra. We also find the formation of an organic solid condensate at 1500 K and under Lyα UV radiation, confirming the possibility of forming photochemical hazes in hot-Jupiter exoplanet atmospheres with an enhanced C/O ratio compared to solar.}

The model combines the high level ab initio potential energy surfaces of four excited electronic states and their coordinate dependent transition dipole moment vectors with quantum mechanical calculations of the photodissociation dynamics and the absorption spectra corresponding to excitations from many initial rovibrational states of the parent CO2. The calculations demonstrate that photodynamics from first principles can be realized for CO2 with high accuracy: The absorption cross section can be reliably calculated for λ≤250nm and T≤2500K and used for modeling the one-step photolytic reduction of CO2 to CO. An ab initio-based estimate of the contribution of low lying triplet states to the optical absorption of hot CO2 is also given."

	journal = ApJ,
	abstract = {More than three thousand exoplanets have been detected so far, and more and more spectroscopic observations of exoplanets are performed. Future instruments (James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), E-ELT, PLATO, Ariel, etc.,) are eagerly awaited, as they will be able to provide spectroscopic data with greater accuracy and sensitivity than what is currently available. This will allow more accurate conclusions to be drawn regarding the chemistry and dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres, provided that the observational data are carefully processed. One important aspect to consider is temporal stellar atmospheric disturbances that can influence the planetary composition, and hence spectra, and potentially can lead to incorrect assumptions about the steady-state atmospheric composition of the planet. In this paper, we focus on perturbations coming from the host star in the form of flare events that significantly increase photon flux impingement on the exoplanets atmosphere. In some cases, particularly for M stars, this sudden increase may last for several hours. We aim to discover to what extent a stellar flare is able to modify the chemical composition of the planetary atmosphere and, therefore, influence the resulting spectra. We use a one-dimensional thermo-photochemical model to study the neutral atmospheric composition of two hypothetical planets located around the star AD Leo. We place the two planets at different distances from the star, which results in effective atmospheric temperatures of 412 and 1303 K. AD Leo is an active star that has already been observed during a flare. Therefore, we use the spectroscopic data from this flare event to simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of the atmospheres of the two hypothetical planets. We compute synthetic spectra to evaluate the implications for observations. The increase in the incoming photon flux affects the chemical abundances of some important species (such as H and NH3), down to altitudes associated with an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar, which can lead to variations in planetary spectra (up to 150 ppm) if performed during transit. We find that each exoplanet has a post-flare steady-state composition that is significantly different from the pre-flare steady-state. We predict that these variations could be detectable with both current and future spectroscopic instruments, if sufficiently high signal-to-noise spectra are obtained.}
