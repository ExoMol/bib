	abstract = {The measurements of the solar ultraviolet spectral irradiance made by the two Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) solar instruments, Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) and SOLar STellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE), are compared with same-day measurements by two solar instruments on the shuttle ATmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) missions, ATLAS SUSIM and Shuttle Solar Backscatter UltraViolet (SSBUV) experiment. These measurements from the four instruments agree to within the 2σ uncertainty of any one instrument, which is 5 to 10\% for all wavelengths above 160 nm and for strong emission features below 160 nm. Additionally, the long-term relative accuracy of the two UARS data sets is better than the original 2\% goal, especially at wavelengths greater than 160 nm. This level of agreement is credited to accurate preflight calibrations coupled with comprehensive inflight calibrations to track instrument degradation. Two solar irradiance spectra, 119 to 410 nm, are presented; the first combines observations from UARS SUSIM and UARS SOLSTICE taken on March 29, 1992, during the ATLAS 1 mission, and the second combines spectra for April 15, 1993, during the ATLAS 2 mission. The ATLAS 1 mission coincided with the initial decline from the maximum of solar cycle 22 when solar activity was relatively high. The ATLAS 2 mission occurred somewhat later during the declining phase of the solar cycle 22 when solar activity was more moderate.},

Title = {Exploring the vacuum ultraviolet photochemistry of astrochemically
   important triatomic molecules},
Journal = {Nati. Sci. Rev.},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {The recently constructed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) free electron laser
   (FEL) at the Dalian Coherent Light Source (DCLS) is yielding a wealth of
   new and exquisitely detailed information about the photofragmentation
   dynamics of many small gas-phase molecules. This Review focuses
   particular attention on five triatomic molecules-H2O, H2S, CO2, OCS and
   CS2. Each shows excitation wavelength-dependent dissociation dynamics,
   yielding photofragments that populate a range of electronic and (in the
   case of diatomic fragments) vibrational and rotational quantum states,
   which can be characterized by different translational spectroscopy
   methods. The photodissociation of an isolated molecule from a
   well-defined initial quantum state provides a lens through which one can
   investigate how and why chemical reactions occur, and provides numerous
   opportunities for fruitful, synergistic collaborations with high-level
   ab initio quantum chemists. The chosen molecules, their photofragments
   and the subsequent chemical reaction networks to which they can
   contribute are all crucial in planetary atmospheres and in interstellar
   and circumstellar environments. The aims of this Review are 3-fold: to
   highlight new photochemical insights enabled by the VUV-FEL at the DCLS,
   notably the recently recognized central atom elimination process that is
   shown to contribute in all of these triatomic molecules; to highlight
   some of the potential implications of this rich photochemistry to our
   understanding of interstellar chemistry and molecular evolution within
   the universe; and to highlight other and future research directions in
   areas related to chemical reaction dynamics and astrochemistry that will
   be enabled by increased access to VUV-FEL sources.
   This review summarizes rich photochemistry of triatomic molecules in the
   vacuum ultraviolet region, and their potential implications to our
   understanding of interstellar chemistry and molecular evolution in the
   universe.},

   found that the 21I1 < X I El, 3111< X I El, and 4111 < X I El

Title = {{Photochemistry and Spectral Characterization of Temperate and Gas-rich

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{921}},
Abstract = {{Exoplanets that receive stellar irradiance approximately equal to
   Earth's or less have been discovered and many are suitable for spectral
   characterization. Here, we focus on the temperate planets that have
   massive H-2-dominated atmospheres, and trace the chemical reactions and
   transport following the photodissociation of H2O, CH4, NH3, and H2S,
   with K2-18 b, PH2 b, and Kepler-167 e representing temperate/cold
   planets around M and G/K stars. We find that NH3 is likely depleted by
   photodissociation to the cloud deck on planets around G/K stars but
   remains intact in the middle atmosphere of planets around M stars. A
   common phenomenon on temperate planets is that the photodissociation of
   NH3 in the presence of CH4 results in HCN as the main photochemical
   product. The photodissociation of CH4 together with H2O leads to CO and
   CO2, and the synthesis of hydrocarbon is suppressed. Temperate planets
   with a supersolar atmospheric metallicity and appreciable internal heat
   may have additional CO and CO2 from the interior and less NH3, and thus
   less HCN. Our models of K2-18 b can explain the transmission spectrum
   measured by the Hubble Space Telescope, and indicate that future
   observations in 0.5-5.0 mu m wavelength range would provide the
   sensitivity to detect the equilibrium gases CH4, H2O, and NH3, the
   photochemical gas HCN, as well as CO2 in some cases. Temperate and
   H-2-rich exoplanets are thus laboratories of atmospheric chemistry that
   operate in regimes not found in the solar system, and spectral
   characterization of these planets in transit or reflected starlight
   promises to greatly expand the types of molecules detected in exoplanet
   atmospheres.}},

Journal = {Nature Comms.},

Volume = {{12}},
Abstract = {{The provenance of oxygen on the Earth and other planets in the Solar
   System is a fundamental issue. It has been widely accepted that the only
   prebiotic pathway to produce oxygen in the Earth's primitive atmosphere
   was via vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodissociation of CO2 and subsequent
   two O atom recombination. Here, we provide experimental evidence of
   three-body dissociation (TBD) of H2O to produce O atoms in both D-1 and
   P-3 states upon VUV excitation using a tunable VUV free electron laser.
   Experimental results show that the TBD is the dominant pathway in the
   VUV H2O photochemistry at wavelengths between 90 and 107.4nm. The
   relative abundance of water in the interstellar space with its exposure
   to the intense VUV radiation suggests that the TBD of H2O and subsequent
   O atom recombination should be an important prebiotic O-2-production,
   which may need to be incorporated into interstellar photochemical
   models. Three-body dissociation of water, producing one oxygen and two
   hydrogen atoms, has been difficult to investigate due to the lack of
   intense vacuum ultraviolet sources. Here, using a tunable free-electron
   laser, the authors obtain quantum yields for this channel showing that
   it is a possible route to prebiotic oxygen formation in interstellar

Here, we present the results of a first laboratory experimental simulation of photochemistry in carbon-rich exoplanet atmospheres at elevated temperatures. The evolution of gas-phase molecular composition was quantitatively monitored with infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We found that H2/CO gas compositions can change significantly from thermal equilibria compositions when irradiated with Lyα photons at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1500 K. Carbon dioxide and water were found to be the main products caused by photolysis, while the formation of methane was also observed to a lesser extent. We find that photochemistry efficiency is strongly correlated with increasing temperature. Our finding that water is efficiently produced by photochemistry in a supersolar C/O = 1 environment, representing C enhancement relative to solar values C/O ratio = 0.54, has significant implications for the interpretation of many exoplanet transmission spectra. We also find the formation of an organic solid condensate at 1500 K and under Lyα UV radiation, confirming the possibility of forming photochemical hazes in hot-Jupiter exoplanet atmospheres with an enhanced C/O ratio compared to solar.}

abstract = "This paper analyzes the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide in the wavelength range λ≤250nm by means of a first principles model. The model combines the high level ab initio potential energy surfaces of four excited electronic states and their coordinate dependent transition dipole moment vectors with quantum mechanical calculations of the photodissociation dynamics and the absorption spectra corresponding to excitations from many initial rovibrational states of the parent CO2. The calculations demonstrate that photodynamics from first principles can be realized for CO2 with high accuracy: The absorption cross section can be reliably calculated for λ≤250nm and T≤2500K and used for modeling the one-step photolytic reduction of CO2 to CO. An ab initio-based estimate of the contribution of low lying triplet states to the optical absorption of hot CO2 is also given."

	journal = ApJ,
	abstract = {More than three thousand exoplanets have been detected so far, and more and more spectroscopic observations of exoplanets are performed.
Future instruments (James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), E-ELT, PLATO, Ariel, etc.,) are eagerly awaited, as they will be able to provide spectroscopic data with 
greater accuracy and sensitivity than what is currently available. This will allow more accurate conclusions to be drawn regarding the chemistry and dynamics 
of exoplanetary atmospheres, provided that the observational data are carefully processed. One important aspect to consider is temporal stellar 
atmospheric disturbances that can influence the planetary composition, and hence spectra, and potentially can lead to incorrect assumptions about 
the steady-state atmospheric composition of the planet. In this paper, we focus on perturbations coming from the host star in the form of flare events that significantly increase photon flux impingement on the exoplanets atmosphere. In some cases, particularly for M stars, this sudden increase may last for several hours. We aim to discover to what extent a stellar flare is able to modify the chemical composition of the planetary atmosphere and, therefore, influence the resulting spectra. We use a one-dimensional thermo-photochemical model to study the neutral atmospheric composition of two hypothetical planets located around the star AD Leo. We place the two planets at different distances from the star, which results in effective atmospheric temperatures of 412 and 1303 K. AD Leo is an active star that has already been observed during a flare. Therefore, we use the spectroscopic data from this flare event to simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of the atmospheres of the two hypothetical planets. We compute synthetic spectra to evaluate the implications for observations. The increase in the incoming photon flux affects the chemical abundances of some important species (such as H and NH3), down to altitudes associated with an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar, which can lead to variations in planetary spectra (up to 150 ppm) if performed during transit. We find that each exoplanet has a post-flare steady-state composition that is significantly different from the pre-flare steady-state. We predict that these variations could be detectable with both current and future spectroscopic instruments, if sufficiently high signal-to-noise spectra are obtained.}
