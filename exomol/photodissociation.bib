Abstract = {{Theoretical studies of photodissociation cross sections of the beryllium
   monohydride cation BeH+ are reported. Explicit photodissociation cross
   sections are computed for transitions from its ground electronic state
   X-1 Sigma(+) to excited ones A(1)Sigma(+), B-1 Pi and C-1 Sigma(+)
   respectively. Partial cross sections are computed for nearly the full
   range of rovibrational levels of the X-1 Sigma(+) state and for photon
   wavelengths ranging from 70 nm to threshold. Photodissociation cross
   sections are presented at temperatures of 1800K, 4500K, 10000K and
   20000K as examples, where a Boltzmann distribution of initial
   rovibrational levels is assumed. This paper provides the complementary
   photodissociation cross sections following the bound-bound transition of
   previous work for BeH+ {[}7]. The results are applicable to the
   photodissociation of BeH+ in the early universe and in a variety of
   ultraviolet (UV) irradiated interstellar environments, which is of great
   importance to the modelling of features of interstellar observations as
   well as the fusion plasma emissions in the edge and divertor region. }},

abstract = "This paper analyzes the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide in the wavelength range λ≤250nm by means of a first principles model. The model combines the high level ab initio potential energy surfaces of four excited electronic states and their coordinate dependent transition dipole moment vectors with quantum mechanical calculations of the photodissociation dynamics and the absorption spectra corresponding to excitations from many initial rovibrational states of the parent CO2. The calculations demonstrate that photodynamics from first principles can be realized for CO2 with high accuracy: The absorption cross section can be reliably calculated for λ≤250nm and T≤2500K and used for modeling the one-step photolytic reduction of CO2 to CO. An ab initio-based estimate of the contribution of low lying triplet states to the optical absorption of hot CO2 is also given."
