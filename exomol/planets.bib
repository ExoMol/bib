   journal = {Frontiers In Earth Science},
   year = {2023},
   volume = {11},
   abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) of volcanic gases has become a central tool for
   studying volcanic activity. For instance, ultraviolet (UV) skylight
   spectroscopy with grating spectrographs (GS) enables SO2 (and, under
   favourable conditions, BrO) quantification in volcanic plumes from
   autonomous platforms at safe distances. These measurements can serve
   volcanic monitoring and they cover all stages of volcanic activity in
   long measurement time series, which substantially contributes to the
   refinement of theories on volcanic degassing. Infrared (IR) remote
   sensing techniques are able to measure further volcanic gases (e.g., HF,
   HCl, CO2, CO). However, the employed Fourier transform spectrometers
   (FTSs) are intrinsically intricate and, due to limited resolving power
   or light throughput, mostly rely on either lamps, direct sun, or hot
   lava as light source, usually limiting measurements to individual field
   campaigns. We show that many limitations of grating spectrographs and
   Fourier transform spectrometer measurements can be overcome by
   Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) based spectrograph implementations.
   Compared to grating spectrographs and Fourier transform spectrometers,
   Fabry-Perot interferometer spectrographs reach a 1-3 orders of magnitude
   higher spectral resolution and superior light throughput with compact
   and stable set-ups. This leads to 1) enhanced sensitivity and
   selectivity of the spectral trace gas detection, 2) enables the
   measurement of so far undetected volcanic plume constituents {[}e.g.,
   hydroxyl (OH) or sulfanyl (SH)], and 3) extends the range of gases that
   can be measured continuously using the sky as light source. Here, we
   present measurements with a shoe-box-size Fabry-Perot interferometer
   spectrograph (resolving power of ca. 150000), performed in the crater of
   Nyiragongo volcano. By analysing the light of a ultraviolet light
   emitting diode that is sent through the hot gas emission of an active
   lava flow, we reach an OH detection limit of about 20 ppb, which is
   orders of magnitude lower than the mixing ratios predicted by
   high-temperature chemical models. Furthermore, we introduce example
   calculations that demonstrate the feasibility of skylight-based remote
   sensing of HF and HCl in the short-wave infrared with Fabry-Perot
   interferometer spectrographs, which opens the path to continuous
   monitoring and data acquisition during all stages of volcanic activity.
   This is only one among many further potential applications of remote
   sensing of volcanic gases with high spectral resolution.},
