The neutral spectrum measured by Cassini's Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, which includes substantial methane, ammonia, and organics in addition to the anticipated molecular hydrogen, helium, and water, serves as input for unexpectedly complex ionospheric chemistry. Heavy molecular ions are found to dominate Saturn's equatorial low-altitude ionosphere, with a mean ion mass of 11 Da. Key molecular ions include H3O+ and HCO+; other abundant heavy ions depend upon the makeup of the mass 28 neutral species, which cannot be uniquely determined. Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer neutral species lead to generally good agreement between modeled and observed plasma densities, though poor reproduction of measured H+ and H3+ variability and an overabundance of modeled H3+ potentially hint at missing physical processes in the model, including a loss process that affects H3+ but not H+.},

Abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) nightglow data from the SPICAV instrument (SPectroscopy
   for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Venus)
   onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, currently in orbit around Venus,
   are presented. In its extended source mode, SPICAV has shown that the
   Venus nightglow in the UV contains essentially Lyman-alpha and Nitric
   Oxide (NO) emissions. In the stellar mode, when the slit of the
   spectrometer is removed, an emission is also observed at the limb in
   addition to the stellar spectrum. A forward model allows us to identify
   this feature as being an NO emission. Due to radiative recombination of
   N and O atoms produced on the dayside of Venus, and transported to the
   nightside. NO nightglow provides important constraints to the
   Solar-to-Anti Solar thermospheric circulation prevailing above 90 km.
   The forward model presented here allows us to derive the altitude of the
   peak of emission of the NO layer, found at 113.5 +/- 6 km, as well as
   its scale height, of 3.4 +/- 1 km and its brightness. The latter is
   found to be very variable with emissions between 19 Kilo-Rayleigh (kR)
   and 540 kR. In addition, the NO nightglow is sometimes very patchy, as
   we are able to observe two distinct emission zones in the field of view.
   Finally, systematic extraction of this emission from stellar
   occultations extends the database of the NO emission already reported
   elsewhere using limb observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The spectrum of Saturn has been recorded between 4.5 and 16.0 mu m with
   the grating mode of the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) of ISO. The
   resolving power is 1500. The main results of this observation are (1)
   the detection of CO2 CH3C2H and C4H2 in the stratosphere and (2) the
   detection of H2O in the troposphere. In the 4.5-5.5 mu m range,
   information is retrieved on the tropospheric composition (NH3, PH3,
   AsH3, GeH4, CH3D and H2O) down to pressure levels of several bars. Above
   7 mu m, the Saturn spectrum probes the upper troposphere and the lower
   stratosphere, at pressure levels ranging from 0.5 bar to 0.4 mbar. The
   CH4 emission band at 7.7 mu m and the H-2-He continuum longward of 11 mu
   m are used to retrieve the thermal profile, which is then used to derive
   the vertical distributions of minor species: NH3, PH3, CH3D in the
   troposphere, and C2H2 and C2H6 in the stratosphere. Estimates of the
   CO2, CH3C2H and C4H2 mean mixing ratios (above the 10-mbar level) are 3
   10(-10), 6 10(-10) and 9 10(-11) respectively. The retrieved
   disk-averaged thermal profile is found to be colder in the stratosphere
   than the Voyager 1 ingress radio-occultation profile by about 7 K at P =
   0.5 mbar, and slightly warmer in the troposphere (about 5 K at 400 mbar
   and 3 K at 150 mb).},

abstract = {During the passage of Voyager 1 through the Saturn system, the infrared
instrument acquired spectral and radiometric data on Saturn, the rings, and Titan
and other satellites. Infrared spectra of Saturn indicate the presence of H2, CH4,
NH3, PH3, C2H2, C2H6, and possibly C3H4 and C3H8. A hydrogen mole fraction of 0.94
is inferred with an uncertainty of a few percent, implying a depletion of helium
in the atmosphere of Saturn relative to that of Jupiter. The atmospheric thermal
structure of Saturn shows hemisphere asymmetries that are consistent with a response
to the seasonally varying insolation. Extensive small-scale latitudinal structure
is also observed. On Titan, positive identifications of infrared spectral features
are made for CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and HCN; tentative identifications are made
for C3H4 and C3H8. The infrared continuum opacity on Titan appears to be quite
small between 500 and 600 cmâ€“1, implying that the solid surface is a major contributor
to the observed emission over this spectral range; between 500 and 200 cmâ€“1 theopacity
increases with decreasing wave number, attaining an optical thickness in excess
of 2 at 200 cmâ€“1. Temperatures near the 1-millibar level are independent of
longitude and local time but show a decrease of âˆ¼ 20 K between the equator and north
pole, which suggests a seasonally dependent cyclostrophic zonal flow in the stratosphere
of âˆ¼ 100 meters per second. Measurements of the C ring of Saturn yield a temperature
of 85 Â± 1 K and an infrared optical depth of 0.09 Â± 0.01. Radiometer observations
of sunlight transmitted through the ring system indicate an optical depth of 10â€“1.3 Â±0.3
for the Cassini division. A phase integral of 1.02 Â± 0.06 is inferred for Rhea,
which agrees with values for other icy bodies in the solar system. Rhea eclipse
observations indicate the presence of surface materials with both high and low
thermal inertias, the former most likely a blocky component and the latter a frost.},
