abstract = {Spectrometers employing acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs) rapidly gain popularity in space, and in particular on interplanetary missions. They allow for reducing volume, mass, and complexity of the instrumentation. To date, space operations of 11 AOTF spectrometers are reported in the literature. They were used for analyzing ocean color, greenhouse gases, atmospheres of Mars and Venus, and for lunar mineralogy. More instruments for the Moon, Mars, and asteroid mineralogy are in flight, awaiting launch, or in the state of advanced development. The AOTFs are used in point (pencil-beam) spectrometers for selecting echelle diffraction orders, or in hyper-spectral imagers and microscopes. We review the AOTF-employing devices flown in space or ready to set off. The paper considers basic principles of the AOTF and science applications of the AOTF spectrometers, and describes developed instruments in some detail. We also address some advanced developments for future missions and plans. In addition, we discuss lessons learned during instrument design, build, calibration, and exploitation, and advantages and limitations in implementing the AOTF-based systems in space instrumentation.},

abstract = {Abstract We report on the electron, ion, and dust number densities and the electron temperatures obtained by the Radio and Plasma Wave Science instruments onboard Cassini during the Ring-Grazing orbits. The numerous ring passage observations show a consistent picture as follows: (1) Beyond 0.1 RS above and below the equator the electron and ion densities are quasi-neutral with a distribution similar to the one obtained in the plasma disk. (2) A sharp ion density enhancement occurs at |Z| < 0.1 RS, to more than 200 cm-3 at the equator, while the electron density remains low only to values of 50 cm-3. The electron/ion density ratio is 0.1 at the equator. (3) Micrometer-sized dust has also been observed at the equator. However, the region of intense dust signals is significantly narrower (|Z| < 0.02 RS) than the enhanced ion density regions. (4) The electron temperature (Te) generally decreases with decreasing Z with small Te enhancements near the equator. We show that the dust size characteristics are different depending on the distance from the equator, and the large micrometer-sized grains are more perceptible in a narrow region near the equator where the power law slope of the dust size distribution becomes less steep. As a result, different scale heights are obtained for nanometer and micrometer grains. Throughout the ring, the dominant part of the negative charges is carried by the small nanometer-sized grains. The electron/ion density ratio is variable from orbit to orbit, suggesting changes in the dust charging over time scales of weeks.},

	abstract = {The Cassini spacecraft spent 13 years orbiting Saturn; as it ran low on fuel, the trajectory was changed to sample regions it had not yet visited. A series of orbits close to the rings was followed by a Grand Finale orbit, which took the spacecraft through the gap between Saturn and its rings before the spacecraft was destroyed when it entered the planet{\textquoteright}s upper atmosphere. Six papers in this issue report results from these final phases of the Cassini mission. Dougherty et al. measured the magnetic field close to Saturn, which implies a complex multilayer dynamo process inside the planet. Roussos et al. detected an additional radiation belt trapped within the rings, sustained by the radioactive decay of free neutrons. Lamy et al. present plasma measurements taken as Cassini flew through regions emitting kilometric radiation, connected to the planet{\textquoteright}s aurorae. Hsu et al. determined the composition of large, solid dust particles falling from the rings into the planet, whereas Mitchell et al. investigated the smaller dust nanograins and show how they interact with the planet{\textquoteright}s upper atmosphere. Finally, Waite et al. identified molecules in the infalling material and directly measured the composition of Saturn{\textquoteright}s atmosphere.Science, this issue p. eaat5434, p. eaat1962, p. eaat2027, p. eaat3185, p. eaat2236, p. eaat2382INTRODUCTIONPast remote observations of Saturn by Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and 2, Earth-based observatories, and the Cassini prime and solstice missions suggested an inflow of water from the rings to the atmosphere. This would modify the chemistry of Saturn{\textquoteright}s upper atmosphere and ionosphere. In situ observations during the Cassini Grand Finale provided an opportunity to study this chemical interaction.RATIONALEThe Cassini Grand Finale consisted of 22 orbital revolutions (revs), with the closest approach to Saturn between the inner D ring and the equatorial atmosphere. The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measured the composition of Saturn{\textquoteright}s upper atmosphere and its chemical interactions with material originating in the rings.RESULTSMolecular hydrogen was the most abundant constituent at all altitudes sampled. Analysis of the atmospheric structure of H2 indicates a scale height with a temperature of 340 {\textpm} 20 K below 4000 km, at the altitudes and near-equatorial latitudes sampled by INMS.Water infall from the rings was observed, along with substantial amounts of methane, ammonia, molecular nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and impact fragments of organic nanoparticles. The infalling mass flux was calculated to be between 4800 and 45,000 kg s-1 in a latitude band of 8{\textdegree} near the equator.The interpretation of this spectrum is complicated by the Cassini spacecraft{\textquoteright}s high velocity of 31 km s-1 relative to Saturn{\textquoteright}s atmosphere. At this speed, molecules and particles have 5 eV per nucleon of energy and could have fragmented upon impact within the INMS antechamber of the closed ion source. As a result, the many organic compounds detected by INMS are very likely fragments of larger nanoparticles.Evidence from INMS indicates the presence of molecular volatiles and organic fragments in the infalling material. Methane, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen make up the volatile inflow, whereas ammonia, water, carbon dioxide, and organic compound fragments are attributed to fragmentation inside the instrument{\textquoteright}s antechamber of icy, organic-rich grains. The observations also show evidence for orbit-to-orbit variations in the mixing ratios of infalling material; this suggests that the source region of the material is temporally and/or longitudinally variable, possibly corresponding to localized source regions in the D ring.CONCLUSIONThe large mass of infalling material has implications for ring evolution, likely requiring transfer of material from the C ring to the D ring in a repeatable manner. The infalling material can affect the atmospheric chemistry and the carbon content of Saturn{\textquoteright}s ionosphere and atmosphere.INMS mass spectra from the Grand Finale.The graphic depicts the Cassini spacecraft as it passes from north to south between Saturn and its rings. The inset spectrum shows the mass deconvolution of compounds measured by INMS on rev 290. The x axis is in units of mass per charge (u) and extends over the full mass range of INMS (1 to 99 u). The y axis is in counts per measurement cycle integrated over the closest-approach data. The mass influx rate for rev 290, derived from mass deconvolution of the rev-integrated spectrum, is shown as embedded text in the spectrum. The side panel gives the average of the mass deconvolution of revs 290, 291, and 292 in mass density units (g cm{\textendash}3). The composition of the ring-derived compounds in terms of percentage mass density is also shown.IMAGE COURTESY OF NASA/JPL-CALTECH/SWRIThe Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made close-up measurements of Saturn{\textquoteright}s ionosphere and upper atmosphere in the 1970s and 1980s that suggested a chemical interaction between the rings and atmosphere. Exploring this interaction provides information on ring composition and the influence on Saturn{\textquoteright}s atmosphere from infalling material. The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer sampled in situ the region between the D ring and Saturn during the spacecraft{\textquoteright}s Grand Finale phase. We used these measurements to characterize the atmospheric structure and material influx from the rings. The atmospheric He/H2 ratio is 10 to 16\%. Volatile compounds from the rings (methane; carbon monoxide and/or molecular nitrogen), as well as larger organic-bearing grains, are flowing inward at a rate of 4800 to 45,000 kilograms per second.},

Cassini's Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer measured material in three altitude bands and found a global-integrated flux of 2–20 × 104 kg/s that is dominated by hydrocarbon material <104u. Ranging from clusters of a few molecules to radii of several nanometers, nanoparticles are ubiquitous throughout Saturn's rings but embedded in the regolith of larger particles and not detectable as independent particles using remote observations. The smallest nanoparticles are susceptible to atmosphere drag by Saturn's tenuous exosphere that reaches the inner edge of the D ring. The unsustainable large flux suggests a recent disturbance of Saturn's inner ring material, possibly associated with the clumping that appeared in the D68 ringlet in 2015.},

The Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument detected a cold, dense, and dynamic ionosphere at Saturn that interacts with the rings.

The neutral spectrum measured by Cassini's Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, which includes substantial methane, ammonia, and organics in addition to the anticipated molecular hydrogen, helium, and water, serves as input for unexpectedly complex ionospheric chemistry. Heavy molecular ions are found to dominate Saturn's equatorial low-altitude ionosphere, with a mean ion mass of 11 Da. Key molecular ions include H3O+ and HCO+; other abundant heavy ions depend upon the makeup of the mass 28 neutral species, which cannot be uniquely determined. Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer neutral species lead to generally good agreement between modeled and observed plasma densities, though poor reproduction of measured H+ and H3+ variability and an overabundance of modeled H3+ potentially hint at missing physical processes in the model, including a loss process that affects H3+ but not H+.},

Abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) nightglow data from the SPICAV instrument (SPectroscopy
   for the Investigation of the Characteristics of the Atmosphere of Venus)
   onboard the Venus Express spacecraft, currently in orbit around Venus,
   are presented. In its extended source mode, SPICAV has shown that the
   Venus nightglow in the UV contains essentially Lyman-alpha and Nitric
   Oxide (NO) emissions. In the stellar mode, when the slit of the
   spectrometer is removed, an emission is also observed at the limb in
   addition to the stellar spectrum. A forward model allows us to identify
   this feature as being an NO emission. Due to radiative recombination of
   N and O atoms produced on the dayside of Venus, and transported to the
   nightside. NO nightglow provides important constraints to the
   Solar-to-Anti Solar thermospheric circulation prevailing above 90 km.
   The forward model presented here allows us to derive the altitude of the
   peak of emission of the NO layer, found at 113.5 +/- 6 km, as well as
   its scale height, of 3.4 +/- 1 km and its brightness. The latter is
   found to be very variable with emissions between 19 Kilo-Rayleigh (kR)
   and 540 kR. In addition, the NO nightglow is sometimes very patchy, as
   we are able to observe two distinct emission zones in the field of view.
   Finally, systematic extraction of this emission from stellar
   occultations extends the database of the NO emission already reported
   elsewhere using limb observations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The spectrum of Saturn has been recorded between 4.5 and 16.0 mu m with
   the grating mode of the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) of ISO. The
   resolving power is 1500. The main results of this observation are (1)
   the detection of CO2 CH3C2H and C4H2 in the stratosphere and (2) the
   detection of H2O in the troposphere. In the 4.5-5.5 mu m range,
   information is retrieved on the tropospheric composition (NH3, PH3,
   AsH3, GeH4, CH3D and H2O) down to pressure levels of several bars. Above
   7 mu m, the Saturn spectrum probes the upper troposphere and the lower
   stratosphere, at pressure levels ranging from 0.5 bar to 0.4 mbar. The
   CH4 emission band at 7.7 mu m and the H-2-He continuum longward of 11 mu
   m are used to retrieve the thermal profile, which is then used to derive
   the vertical distributions of minor species: NH3, PH3, CH3D in the
   troposphere, and C2H2 and C2H6 in the stratosphere. Estimates of the
   CO2, CH3C2H and C4H2 mean mixing ratios (above the 10-mbar level) are 3
   10(-10), 6 10(-10) and 9 10(-11) respectively. The retrieved
   disk-averaged thermal profile is found to be colder in the stratosphere
   than the Voyager 1 ingress radio-occultation profile by about 7 K at P =
   0.5 mbar, and slightly warmer in the troposphere (about 5 K at 400 mbar
   and 3 K at 150 mb).},

abstract = {During the passage of Voyager 1 through the Saturn system, the infrared
instrument acquired spectral and radiometric data on Saturn, the rings, and Titan
and other satellites. Infrared spectra of Saturn indicate the presence of H2, CH4,
NH3, PH3, C2H2, C2H6, and possibly C3H4 and C3H8. A hydrogen mole fraction of 0.94
is inferred with an uncertainty of a few percent, implying a depletion of helium
in the atmosphere of Saturn relative to that of Jupiter. The atmospheric thermal
structure of Saturn shows hemisphere asymmetries that are consistent with a response
to the seasonally varying insolation. Extensive small-scale latitudinal structure
is also observed. On Titan, positive identifications of infrared spectral features
are made for CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, and HCN; tentative identifications are made
for C3H4 and C3H8. The infrared continuum opacity on Titan appears to be quite
small between 500 and 600 cmâ€“1, implying that the solid surface is a major contributor
to the observed emission over this spectral range; between 500 and 200 cmâ€“1 theopacity
increases with decreasing wave number, attaining an optical thickness in excess
of 2 at 200 cmâ€“1. Temperatures near the 1-millibar level are independent of
longitude and local time but show a decrease of âˆ¼ 20 K between the equator and north
pole, which suggests a seasonally dependent cyclostrophic zonal flow in the stratosphere
of âˆ¼ 100 meters per second. Measurements of the C ring of Saturn yield a temperature
of 85 Â± 1 K and an infrared optical depth of 0.09 Â± 0.01. Radiometer observations
of sunlight transmitted through the ring system indicate an optical depth of 10â€“1.3 Â±0.3
for the Cassini division. A phase integral of 1.02 Â± 0.06 is inferred for Rhea,
which agrees with values for other icy bodies in the solar system. Rhea eclipse
observations indicate the presence of surface materials with both high and low
thermal inertias, the former most likely a blocky component and the latter a frost.},
