Abstract = {{In this paper emission spectra of the plasma produced by laser-matter
   interaction are discussed in terms of the correlation between the
   elementary plasma processes and the evolution of plasma parameters
   during the expansion. Three main stages have been identified and
   discussed in details: high density plasma, near equilibrium plasma and
   non-equilibrium plasma including molecular formation. In order to
   develop a comprehensive point of view on the correlation between plasma
   mechanisms and spectral emission features several concepts already
   discussed and elucidated in the plasma science have been adapted to the
   description of the laser induced plasma and to its ionizing and
   recombining character. }},
