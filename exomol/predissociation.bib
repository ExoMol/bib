Single channel numerical and semiclassical results are compared to results obtained from the full multichannel scattering matrix. The isolated resonance approximation for predissociated levels was thus carefully checked and was found to be valid for all levels. Results are presented for the predissociation probabilities of F1 and F2 components of the rovibronic levels of the A 2Σ+ state for v=0–2.}",
