	journal = {Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics},
	abstract = {This work stresses the importance of the choice of the set of reference functions in the generalized multichannel quantum defect theory to analyse the location and the width of a Feshbach resonance occurring in collisional cross-sections. This is illustrated on the photoassociation of cold rubidium atom pairs, which is also modelled using the mapped Fourier grid Hamiltonian method combined with an optical potential. The specificity of the present example lies in a high density of quasi-bound states (closed channel) interacting with a dissociation continuum (open channel). We demonstrate that the optimization of the reference functions leads to quantum defects with a weak energy dependence across the relevant energy threshold. The main result of our paper is that the agreement between both theoretical approaches is achieved only if optimized reference functions are used.}

    abstract = "{A local minimum is found in the 0g+ long range potential curves of the K2 and Rb2 alkali dimers. This well-of magnitude 42 cm−1 for K2 and 93 cm−1 for Rb2—is located above the first ns+n2P3/2 dissociation limit and metastable states could be populated using laser light blue detuned compared to the resonance line. To compute the previously unknown energies and lifetimes of these quasibound states, two grid methods are employed. One method is based on diagonalizing a Fourier grid Hamiltonian, the other uses a propagation technique in imaginary time to filter out vibrational eigenfunctions. Equivalent results are given by both methods. Then the lifetimes are extracted from the correlation function obtained by propagation in real time of these numerical vibrational wave functions. The methods are employed both in adiabatic representation with one electronic potential curve and in diabatic representation with two potential curves. Two quasibound states are found for K2, and three for Rb2 above seven stable bound states. Their lifetimes vary from 20 ps to 3 ns.}",
