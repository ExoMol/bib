   molecular transitions in the microwave and infrared regions}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {440-452},
Abstract = {{An expression was developed that correctly models the temperature
   dependence of the half-width over large temperature ranges and the
   temperature dependence of the line shift, even for cases where the line
   shift changes sign. The expression was derived from the expansion of the
   collisional cross-sections in a series of powers of the relative
   velocity of the radiator and perturber. Cutting off at two terms yields
   a complex double power law (DPL) expression, where the real and
   imaginary parts describe the temperature dependence of the half-width
   and line shift, respectively. Data were collected for more than 100
   thousand transitions and the standard power law expression for the
   half-width and line shift were compared with the new double power law
   expression. It is shown that the double power law works well for all
   transitions, even those that exhibit unusual structure, which the
   standard power law cannot model. The DPL expression gives better results
   than the standard power law for all transitions studied and the DPL
   model gives good results for the temperature dependence of the line
   shift when it changes sign. The DPL model for the temperature dependence
   of the line shift was compared with the linear model, which is currently
   used on the HITRAN database. In all cases the DPL model gave much better
   results than the linear model no matter what temperature range was
   considered. The new formalism allows a substantial reduction in the
   number of parameters that need to be stored in databases and the same
   expression can be utilized in radiative}},

   then complement the aforementioned book by presenting the theoretical
   approaches, results and data proposed (mostly) in the last decade on the
   topics of isolated line shapes, line-broadening and-shifting,
   line-mixing, the far wings and associated continua, and
   collision-induced absorption. Examples of recently demonstrated

Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {275-284},
Abstract = {{Water can be detected throughout the universe: in comets, asteroids,
   dwarf planets, the inner and outer planets in our solar system, cool
   stars, brown dwarfs, and on many exoplanets. Here the focus is on
   locations rich in hydrogen gas. To properly study these environments,
   there is a need for the line shape parameters for H2O transitions in
   collision with hydrogen. This work presents calculations of the half
   width and line shift, made using the Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy
   (MCRB) formalism, at a number of temperatures. It is shown that this
   collision system is strongly off-resonance. For such conditions, the
   atom-atom part of the intermolecular potential dominates the interaction
   of the radiating and perturbing molecules. The atom-atom parameters were
   adjusted by fitting the H2O-H-2 measurements of Brown and Plymate
   (1996). Several techniques were used to extract lines for which there is
   more confidence in the quality of the data. The final potential yields
   results that agree with the measurements with similar to 0.3\%
   difference and a 5.9\% standard deviation. Using this potential, MCRB
   calculations were made for all transitions in the pure rotation, v(2),
   v(1), and v(3) bands. The structure of the line shape parameters and the
   temperature dependence of the half-width, as a function of the
   rotational and vibrational quantum numbers, are discussed. It is shown
   that the power law model of the T-dependence of the half-width is
   inadequate over large temperature ranges. }},

The collected data were used to create semi-empirical models so that every \{HITRAN\} line of the studied molecules has corresponding parameters. Since \{H2\} and He are major constituents in the atmospheres of gas giants, and \{CO2\} predominates in atmospheres of some rocky planets with volcanic activity, these spectroscopic data are important for remote sensing studies of planetary atmospheres. In this paper we make the first step in assembling complete sets of these parameters, thereby creating datasets for SO2, NH3, HF, HCl, \{OCS\} and C2H2. "

Abstract = {{A laser absorption technique, based upon a pair of

   lines. More particularly, the performance of the quadratic
   approximation, either used alone or considered in conjunction with the
   Dicke narrowing effect, was investigated and compared to that of the
   confluent hypergeometric dependence. Hence, experimental evidences of
   the partial failure of the quadratic approximation are given and
   discussed. Finally, we investigate the possible influence of the choice

For the complex error function w(x+iy), whose real part is the Voigt function K(x,y), code optimizations of rational approximations are investigated. An assessment of requirements for atmospheric radiative transfer modeling indicates a y range over many orders of magnitude and accuracy better than 10−4. Following a brief survey of complex error function algorithms in general and rational function approximations in particular the problems associated with subdivisions of the x, y plane (i.e., conditional branches in the code) are discussed and practical aspects of Fortran and Python implementations are considered. Benchmark tests of a variety of algorithms demonstrate that programming language, compiler choice, and implementation details influence computational speed and there is no unique ranking of algorithms. A new implementation, based on subdivision of the upper half-plane in only two regions, combining Weideman's rational approximation for small | x | + y &lt; 15 and Humlicek's rational approximation otherwise is shown to be efficient and accurate for all x, y. }

  journal=ApJS,

  abstract={Opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of ultracool dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. We report here on the detailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our group for this application. We also present tables of Rosseland and Planck mean opacities, which are of use in some studies of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs. For the tables presented here we have included the opacities of important atomic and molecular species, including the alkali elements, pressure-induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant opacity sources, but we neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each species how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of public databases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public databases, and our own numerical calculations. We combine these opacities with abundances computed from a chemical equilibrium model using recently revised solar abundances to compute mean opacities. The chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and is applicable to ultracool dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks. We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially increases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature at densities relevant to the atmospheres and interiors of giant planets and brown dwarfs. We provide our opacity tables for public use and discuss their limitations.}

Journal = JQSRT,

Abstract = {{The current edition of the HITRAN compilation employed a sophisticated
   algorithm for combining measurements available for the air-broadened
   half-widths of water-vapor absorption lines with theoretical values.
   Nevertheless, some of the values in the HITRAN database were found to be
   far from ideal, due to large dispersions that still exist in the
   experimental or theoretical methods. Therefore, new criteria were
   developed for introducing the best available air-broadened half-widths
   into HITRAN, based on physical principles and statistics. This update
   concerns the three most abundant isotopologues of water, with the values
   for (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18 17 180 being the ones from analogous
   transitions of the principal isotopologues. The new parameters have been
   tested in different remote-sensing applications and improved constituent
   profiles were obtained. In total, air-broadened half-width values were
   updated for 11,787 transitions of water 16 170 vapor in the HITRAN
   database (6789 for (H2O)-O-16, 2906 for (H2O)-O-17,and 2092 for
   (H2O)-O-18). Some additional updates to the water-vapor line list are
   also presented. The resultant file (01\_hit06.par) was uploaded to the
   HITRAN website (http:// www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/) in September 2006.}},
