   spectrum: Experimental test of the quadratic approximation}},
Journal = PRA,
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Abstract = {{A laser absorption technique, based upon a pair of
   offset-frequency-locked extended-cavity diode lasers, was employed to
   perform line-shape measurements for (H2O)-O-18 vibration-rotation
   transitions at 1.38 mu m, with an extremely high spectral fidelity. This
   important feature was mostly ensured by the highly accurate, absolute,
   and repeatable frequency axis characterizing each acquired spectrum. We
   present the outcomes of a specific study of the speed dependence of
   collision parameters influencing the shape of the (H2O)-O-18 absorption
   lines. More particularly, the performance of the quadratic
   approximation, either used alone or considered in conjunction with the
   Dicke narrowing effect, was investigated and compared to that of the
   confluent hypergeometric dependence. Hence, experimental evidences of
   the partial failure of the quadratic approximation are given and
   discussed. Finally, we investigate the possible influence of the choice
   of the speed-dependent line-shape model on the retrieved collisional
   parameters.}},

Title = {{Current updates of the water-vapor line list in HITRAN: A new ``diet{''}
   for air-broadened half-widths}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {389-402},
Abstract = {{The current edition of the HITRAN compilation employed a sophisticated
   algorithm for combining measurements available for the air-broadened
   half-widths of water-vapor absorption lines with theoretical values.
   Nevertheless, some of the values in the HITRAN database were found to be
   far from ideal, due to large dispersions that still exist in the
   experimental or theoretical methods. Therefore, new criteria were
   developed for introducing the best available air-broadened half-widths
   into HITRAN, based on physical principles and statistics. This update
   concerns the three most abundant isotopologues of water, with the values
   for (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18 17 180 being the ones from analogous
   transitions of the principal isotopologues. The new parameters have been
   tested in different remote-sensing applications and improved constituent
   profiles were obtained. In total, air-broadened half-width values were
   updated for 11,787 transitions of water 16 170 vapor in the HITRAN
   database (6789 for (H2O)-O-16, 2906 for (H2O)-O-17,and 2092 for
   (H2O)-O-18). Some additional updates to the water-vapor line list are
   also presented. The resultant file (01\_hit06.par) was uploaded to the
   HITRAN website (http:// www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/) in September 2006.}},

The collected data were used to create semi-empirical models so that every \{HITRAN\} line of the studied molecules has corresponding parameters. Since \{H2\} and He are major constituents in the atmospheres of gas giants, and \{CO2\} predominates in atmospheres of some rocky planets with volcanic activity, these spectroscopic data are important for remote sensing studies of planetary atmospheres. In this paper we make the first step in assembling complete sets of these parameters, thereby creating datasets for SO2, NH3, HF, HCl, \{OCS\} and C2H2. "

abstract = {Rational functions are frequently used as efficient yet accurate numerical approximations for real and complex valued functions. For the complex error function w(x+iy), whose real part is the Voigt function K(x,y), code optimizations of rational approximations are investigated. An assessment of requirements for atmospheric radiative transfer modeling indicates a y range over many orders of magnitude and accuracy better than 10−4. Following a brief survey of complex error function algorithms in general and rational function approximations in particular the problems associated with subdivisions of the x, y plane (i.e., conditional branches in the code) are discussed and practical aspects of Fortran and Python implementations are considered. Benchmark tests of a variety of algorithms demonstrate that programming language, compiler choice, and implementation details influence computational speed and there is no unique ranking of algorithms. A new implementation, based on subdivision of the upper half-plane in only two regions, combining Weideman's rational approximation for small | x | + y &lt; 15 and Humlicek's rational approximation otherwise is shown to be efficient and accurate for all x, y. }

  abstract={Opacities and chemical abundance data are crucial ingredients of ultracool dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmosphere models. We report here on the detailed sources of molecular opacity data employed by our group for this application. We also present tables of Rosseland and Planck mean opacities, which are of use in some studies of the atmospheres, interiors, and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs. For the tables presented here we have included the opacities of important atomic and molecular species, including the alkali elements, pressure-induced absorption by hydrogen, and other significant opacity sources, but we neglect opacity from condensates. We report for each species how we have assembled molecular line data from a combination of public databases, laboratory data that is not yet in the public databases, and our own numerical calculations. We combine these opacities with abundances computed from a chemical equilibrium model using recently revised solar abundances to compute mean opacities. The chemical equilibrium calculation accounts for the settling of condensates in a gravitational field and is applicable to ultracool dwarf and extrasolar planetary atmospheres, but not circumstellar disks. We find that the inclusion of alkali atomic opacity substantially increases the mean opacities over those currently in the literature at densities relevant to the atmospheres and interiors of giant planets and brown dwarfs. We provide our opacity tables for public use and discuss their limitations.}

Abstract = {{A line list of transitions for seven isotopologues of water vapor in the
   1100-4100 wavenumber range has been constructed for application to
   atmospheres rich in CO2. The quantum transitions for (H2O)-O-16,
   (H2O)-O-18, (H2O)-O-17, (HDO)-O-16, (HDO)-O-18, and (HDO)-O-17 are from
   the 2012 HITRAN database (Rothman et al., 2013) and those for (D2O)-O-16
   are from the ab initio line list of Shirin et al. (2008). The database
   was constructed using the best available measured parameters and
   augmented with theoretical calculations. The half-width, gamma, its
   temperature dependence, n, and the line shift, delta, are for CO2 as the
   colliding partner or self-collisions and are determined using the
   Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy (MCRB) theory. The resulting line list
   contains 282 557 transitions and is available, in the HITRAN 2012
   format, from the corresponding author or from the supplemental
   information of the journal.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of water vapor in the atmospheres of Venus or Mars by
   spectroscopic techniques in the infrared range are being made routinely
   by instruments onboard the Venus Express and the Mars Reconnaissance
   Orbiter. The interpretation of these measurements in the 2250-4450
   cm(-1) region is being complicated by the presence of HDO lines
   absorbing radiation in this region. These spectra cannot be modeled
   properly because line shape parameters for CO2 broadening (principal gas
   in these atmospheres) of HDO are not available. Here semi-classical line
   shape calculations for the HDO-CO2 collision system are made using the
   Robert-Bonamy formalism for some 2300 rotational band transitions of
   HDO. From these calculations, the half-width, its temperature
   dependence, and the line shift are determined to aid in the reduction of
   the measured spectra. These data will greatly reduce the uncertainty of
   the reduced profiles from the Venus and Mars measurements and will also
   allow better estimates of the D/H ratio on these planets.}},

Pages = {2027-2036},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) induced pressure broadening coefficients of water
   vapor (H2O) lines have been determined using a terahertz time-domain
   spectrometer (TDS). Thirty-two rotational transitions of H2O were
   observed in the spectral range of 18-102 cm(-1) (550-3050 GHz) for the
   first time. Using TDS allows one to measure absorption spectra with one
   order of magnitude better precision than Fourier transform spectrometer
   in this frequency region. The precision of our broadening coefficient
   measurements was 2.4\% in average. The measured CO2 induced pressure
   broadening coefficients are compared to those calculated by the complex
   Robert-Bonamy formalism. The difference between the measurement and the
   theoretical estimation was in the range of -10.7\% to +19.0\% confirming
   the credibility of the theoretical approach. The impact on retrieval of
   water vapor abundance was examined by performing inversion analysis on
   H2O spectra of Venus atmosphere obtained with the Submillimeter Wave
   Astronomy Satellite. In this example case, the retrieved water vapor
   mixing ratio reduces by half at the altitude region of 70-85 km when
   applying the newly measured broadening coefficient compared to the
   air-broadening coefficient, and changes by 5\% compared to that
   estimated by the complex Robert-Bonamy formalism.}},
