Title = {{GAAS: GPU accelerated absorption simulator}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {2025},
Volume = {333},
Abstract = {Interpreting measured absorption spectroscopy data can require repeated
   simulations of the expected absorption spectrum to fit the data. In
   cases of high temperature or broadband spectra, the computational load
   of the spectral analysis can be expensive due to the large number of
   individual absorption transitions that contribute to each simulation. We
   present a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Accelerated Absorption
   Simulator (GAAS) - a fast, hardware-accelerated, line-by-line absorption
   simulation software for generating absorption spectra based on Voigt and
   Hartmann-Tran lineshape profiles. We show that GAAS produces the same
   output spectra as the hi gh- resolution trans mission molecular
   absorption database (HITRAN) Application Programming Interface (HAPI) to
   within 32-bits of numerical precision for spectra based on both Voigt
   and Hartmann-Tran profiles. We also measure the performance increase
   compared to HAPI and demonstrate that GAAS can reduce simulation time by
   up to 115x for spectra containing many (several thousand or more)
   absorption transitions. The software is provided as an open-source
   python library which is built around an OpenCL implementation of the
   Voigt and Hartmann-Tran lineshape functions. GAAS can be run on a
   variety of GPU hardware including integrated GPUs on most computers and
   high-performance external GPUs. It is installed as a standalone Python
   library, making it accessible and easy to use for many applications.
   GAAS will enable researchers to more efficiently analyze complex
   spectra, especially using advanced lineshapes, to ultimately increase
   the accuracy of complex spectroscopic measurements.},

  title = {TRIDENT: A Rapid 3D Radiative-transfer Model for Exoplanet Transmission
   Spectra},
  journal = ApJ,
  year = {2022},
  volume = {929},
  abstract = {Transmission spectroscopy is one of the premier methods used to probe
   the temperature, composition, and cloud properties of exoplanet
   atmospheres. Recent studies have demonstrated that the multidimensional
   nature of exoplanet atmospheres-due to nonuniformities across the
   day-night transition and between the morning and evening terminators-can
   strongly influence transmission spectra. However, the computational
   demands of 3D radiative-transfer techniques have precluded their usage
   within atmospheric retrievals. Here we introduce TRIDENT, a new 3D
   radiative-transfer model which rapidly computes transmission spectra of
   exoplanet atmospheres with day-night, morning-evening, and vertical
   variations in temperature, chemical abundances, and cloud properties. We
   also derive a general equation for transmission spectra, accounting for
   3D atmospheres, refraction, multiple scattering, ingress/egress, grazing
   transits, stellar heterogeneities, and nightside thermal emission. After
   introducing TRIDENT's linear-algebra-based approach to 3D radiative
   transfer, we propose new parametric prescriptions for 3D temperature and
   abundance profiles and 3D clouds. We show that multidimensional
   transmission spectra exhibit two significant observational signatures:
   (i) day-night composition gradients alter the relative amplitudes of
   absorption features; and (ii) morning-evening composition gradients
   distort the peak-to-wing contrast of absorption features. Finally, we
   demonstrate that these signatures of multidimensional atmospheres incur
   residuals >100 ppm compared to 1D models, rendering them potentially
   detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope. TRIDENT's rapid
   radiative transfer, coupled with parametric multidimensional
   atmospheres, unlocks the final barrier to 3D atmospheric retrievals.},

   state-of-the-art 1D radiative-convective equilibrium code ATMO, and are
   used as surface boundary conditions to calculate the interior structure
   and evolution of 0.001-0.075 M-circle dot objects. Our models include
   several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models
   available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He
   equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics
   calculations has raised the mass by similar to 1-2\% at the
   stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around
   the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key
   improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model
   ATMO, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to
   accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to
   warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling
   curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present
   significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened
   potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines
   in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs.
   We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using
   equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to
   vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the
   pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of
   vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams,
   highlighting how the 3.5-5.5 mu m flux window can be used to calibrate
   vertical mixing in cool T-Y spectral type objects.}},

Transit handles line-by-line opacities from HITRAN, Partridge &amp; Schwenke (H2O), Schwenke (TiO), and Plez (VO) and collision-induced absorption from Borysow, HITRAN, and ExoMol. Transit emission spectra models agree with models from C. Morley (private communication) within a few percent. We applied bart to the Spitzer and Hubble transit observations of the Neptune-sized planet HAT-P-11b. Our analysis of the combined HST and Spitzer data generally agrees with those from previous studies, finding atmospheric models with enhanced metallicity (≳100× solar) and high-altitude clouds (≲1 mbar level). When analyzing only the HST data, our models favor high-metallicity atmospheres, in contrast with the previous analysis by Chachan et al. We suspect that this discrepancy arises from the different choice of chemistry modeling (free constant-with-altitude versus thermochemical equilibrium) and the enhanced parameter correlations found when neglecting the Spitzer observations. The bart source code and documentation are available at https://github.com/exosports/BART.}

   the same chemistry model. The least trivial test involves a mock
   retrieval on synthetic spectra from the Sonora model grid, which uses a
   different radiative transfer technique, a different implementation of
   opacities, and a different chemistry model. A calibration factor, which
   is included to capture uncertainties in the brown dwarf radius, distance

TauREx 3 can act as a library with a simple import taurex command, providing a rich set of classes and functions related to atmospheric modeling. A 10× speedup in forward model computations is achieved as compared to the previous version with a sixfold reduction in retrieval times while maintaining robust results. TauREx 3 is intended as a standalone, all-in-one package for retrievals while the TauREx 3 Python library can build or augment a user’s custom data pipeline easily.}

  abstract = {The bound program calculates the bound states of a complex formed from two interacting particles using coupled-channel methods. It is particularly suitable for the bound states of atom–molecule and molecule–molecule van der Waals complexes and for the near-threshold bound states that are important in ultracold physics. It uses a basis set for all degrees of freedom except R, the separation of the centres of mass of the two particles. The Schrödinger equation is expressed as a set of coupled equations in R. Solutions of the coupled equations are propagated outwards from the classically forbidden region at short range and inwards from the classically forbidden region at long range, and matched at a point in the central region. Built-in coupling cases include atom + rigid linear molecule, atom + vibrating diatom, atom + rigid symmetric top, atom + asymmetric or spherical top, rigid diatom + rigid diatom, and rigid diatom + asymmetric top. Both programs provide an interface for plug-in routines to specify coupling cases (Hamiltonians and basis sets) that are not built in. With appropriate plug-in routines, bound can take account of the effects of external electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields, locating bound-state energies at fixed values of the fields. The related program field uses the same plug-in routines and locates values of the fields where bound states exist at a specified energy. As a special case, it can locate values of the external field where bound states cross scattering thresholds and produce zero-energy Feshbach resonances. Plug-in routines are supplied to handle the bound states of a pair of alkali-metal atoms with hyperfine structure in an applied magnetic field.
    Program summary
    Program Titles: bound and field Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/rtzgf5mwpn.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90 External routines/libraries: LAPACK, BLAS Nature of problem: Solve the Schrödinger equation to locate the bound states of an interacting pair of atoms or molecules as a function of energy (for bound) or external field (for field). Solution method: The Schrödinger equation is expressed in terms of coupled equations in the interparticle distance, R. Solutions of the coupled-channel equations are propagated outwards from the classically forbidden region at short range and inwards from the classically forbidden region at long range, and matched at a point in the central region. Bound states exist at energies where one of the eigenvalues of the log-derivative matching matrix is zero. bound calculates the number of bound states in a specified range of energy and then converges on the bound-state energies. field operates in a similar manner to bound but converges on bound states as a function of external field at fixed energy, or energy fixed with respect to a field-dependent threshold energy. The programs can also generate bound-state wavefunctions if desired. Unusual features: 1. The programs include Hamiltonians for simple atom–molecule and molecule–molecule interactions, and provide an interface that allows users to specify Hamiltonians and basis sets for more complex systems. This interface allows users to include multiple external fields in the Hamiltonian. 2. The programs can propagate very efficiently to long range, making them particularly suited to locating very high-lying bound states.}

   Three-dimensional scattering radiative transfer with ARTES}},
  journal = AA,
  year = {{2017}},
  volume = {{607}},
  abstract = {{Context. Direct imaging has paved the way for atmospheric
   characterization of young and self-luminous gas giants. Scattering in a
   horizontally-inhomogeneous atmosphere causes the disk-integrated
   polarization of the thermal radiation to be linearly polarized, possibly
   detectable with the newest generation of high-contrast imaging
   instruments.
   Aims. We aim to investigate the effect of latitudinal and longitudinal 
   cloud variations, circumplanetary disks, atmospheric oblateness, and
   cloud particle properties on the integrated degree and direction of
   polarization in the near-infrared. We want to understand how 3D
   atmospheric asymmetries affect the polarization signal in order to
   assess the potential of infrared polarimetry for direct imaging
   observations of planetary-mass companions.
   Methods. We have developed a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative
   transfer code (ARTES) for scattered light simulations in (exo) planetary
   atmospheres. The code is applicable to calculations of reflected light
   and thermal radiation in a spherical grid with a parameterized
   distribution of gas, clouds, hazes, and circumplanetary material. A gray
   atmosphere approximation is used for the thermal structure.
   Results. The disk-integrated degree of polarization of a
   horizontally-inhomogeneous atmosphere is maximal when the planet is
   flattened, the optical thickness of the equatorial clouds is large
   compared to the polar clouds, and the clouds are located at high
   altitude. For a flattened planet, the integrated polarization can both
   increase or decrease with respect to a spherical planet which depends on
   the horizontal distribution and optical thickness of the clouds. The
   direction of polarization can be either parallel or perpendicular to the
   projected direction of the rotation axis when clouds are zonally
   distributed. Rayleigh scattering by submicronsized cloud particles will
   maximize the polarimetric signal whereas the integrated degree of
   polarization is significantly reduced with micron-sized cloud particles
   as a result of forward scattering. The presence of a cold or hot
   circumplanetary disk may also produce a detectable degree of
   polarization (less than or similar to 1\%) even with a uniform cloud
   layer in the atmosphere.}},

  abstract = {Opacities of molecules in exoplanet atmospheres rely on increasingly
    detailed line-lists for these molecules. The line lists available today contain
    for many species up to several billions of lines. Computation of the spectral line
    profile created by pressure and temperature broadening, the Voigt profile, of all
    of these lines is becoming a computational challenge. Aims. We aim to create a
    method to compute the Voigt profile in a way that automatically focusses the
    computation time into the strongest lines, while still maintaining the continuum
    contribution of the high number of weaker lines. Methods. Here, we outline a statistical
    line sampling technique that samples the Voigt profile quickly and with high accuracy.
    The number of samples is adjusted to the strength of the line and the local spectral
    line density. This automatically provides high accuracy line shapes for strong
    lines or lines that are spectrally isolated. The line sampling technique automatically
    preserves the integrated line opacity for all lines, thereby also providing the
    continuum opacity created by the large number of weak lines at very low computational cost.
    Results. The line sampling technique is tested for accuracy when computing line
    spectra and correlated-k tables. Extremely fast computations (~3.5 × 105 lines
    per second per core on a standard current day desktop computer) with high accuracy
    (≤1% almost everywhere) are obtained. A detailed recipe on how to perform the

  abstract ={We present the open-source radiative transfer code named HELIOS , which is constructed for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. In its initial version, the model atmospheres of HELIOS are one-dimensional and plane-parallel, and the equation of radiative transfer is solved in the two-stream approximation with nonisotropic scattering. A small set of the main infrared absorbers is employed, computed with the opacity calculator HELIOS-K and combined using a correlated- k approximation. The molecular abundances originate from validated analytical formulae for equilibrium chemistry. We compare HELIOS with the work of Miller-Ricci & Fortney using a model of GJ 1214b, and perform several tests, where we find: model atmospheres with single-temperature layers struggle to converge to radiative equilibrium; k -distribution tables constructed with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/2/56/ajaa5179ieqn1.gif] {$\gtrsim 0.01$} cm −1 resolution in the opacity function ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/2/56/ajaa5179ieqn2.gif] {$\lesssim {10}^{3}$} points per wavenumber bin) may result in errors ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/2/56/ajaa5179ieqn3.gif] {$\gtrsim 1$} %–10% in the synthetic spectra; and a diffusivity factor of 2 approximates well the exact radiative transfer solution in the limit of pure absorption. We construct “null-hypothesis” models (chemical equilibrium, radiative equilibrium, and solar elemental abundances) for six hot Jupiters. We find that the dayside emission spectra of HD 189733b and WASP-43b are consistent with the null hypothesis, while the latter consistently underpredicts the observed fluxes of WASP-8b, WASP-12b, WASP-14b, and WASP-33b. We demonstrate that our results are somewhat insensitive to the choice of stellar models (blackbody, Kurucz, or PHOENIX ) and metallicity, but are strongly affected by higher carbon-to-oxygen ratios.

The current version can handle linear molecules, symmetric tops and asymmetric tops and many possible transitions, both allowed and forbidden, including multiphoton and Raman spectra in addition to the common electric dipole absorptions. Many different interactions can be included in the calculation, including those arising from electron and nuclear spin, and external electric and magnetic fields. Multiple states and interactions between them can also be accounted for, limited only by available memory. Fitting of experimental data can be to line positions (in many common formats), intensities or band contours and the parameters determined can be level populations as well as rotational constants. pgopher is provided with a powerful and flexible graphical user interface to simplify many of the tasks required in simulating, understanding and fitting molecular spectra, including Fortrat diagrams and energy level plots in addition to overlaying experimental and simulated spectra. The program is open source, and can be compiled with open source tools. This paper provides a formal description of the operation of version 9.1. }

These tools currently employ the NIST ASD, HITRAN2012, and HITEMP2010 databases to perform line-by-line simulations of spectra. SpectraPlot employs a modular, integrated architecture, enabling multiple simulations across multiple databases and/or thermodynamic conditions to be visualized in a single interactive plot window. The primary objective of this paper is to describe the architecture and spectroscopic models employed by SpectraPlot in order to provide its users with the knowledge required to understand the capabilities and limitations of simulations performed using SpectraPlot. Further, this manuscript discusses the accuracy of several underlying approximations used to decrease computational time, namely, the use of far-wing cutoff criteria. }

   coupling terms may be optionally included in the vibrational
   Hamiltonian. Non-negligible VCI matrix elements are stored in sparse
   matrix format to alleviate the diagonalization problem. CPU and memory
   requirements may be further controlled by algorithmic choices and/or
   numerical screening procedures, and recommended values are established
   by benchmarking using a test set of 44 molecules for which accurate
   analytical potential energy surfaces are available.
   Force fields in normal mode coordinates are obtained from the PyPES
   library of high quality analytical potential energy surfaces (to 6th
   order) or by numerical differentiation of analytic second derivatives
   generated using the GAMESS quantum chemical program package (to 4th

   Nature of problem: The simulation of accurate molecular vibrational
   spectra is a significant and long-standing problem in computational
   chemistry. There are two major challenges: constructing an accurate ab
   initio potential energy surface and solving the nuclear vibrational
   problem. Both scale poorly with respect to molecular size, requiring
   large amounts of CPU time and memory.
   Solution method: We have implemented a straightforward numerical
   differentiation algorithm to construct quartic force fields in normal
   mode coordinates using second derivatives of the energy with respect to
   nuclear displacement obtained from ab initio quantum chemical
   calculations, for nuclear vibrational structure algorithm development
   and testing purposes. We have also provided an interface to the PyPES
   library of high quality semi-global potential energy surfaces, which
   enable quantitative prediction of molecular vibrational spectra. To
   solve the nuclear vibrational problem, we use a vibrational
   configuration interaction algorithm in a harmonic oscillator basis.
   Unusual features: One of the unusual features of our code is its
   flexibility, with multiple ways of generating or supplying force field
   data, dynamic memory allocation, adjustable screening thresholds, and
   explicit user control over terms in the VCI wave-function (maximum
   excitation level and extent of mode coupling). We employ sparse matrix
   linear algebra libraries to reduce the memory required for VCI matrix
   storage and diagonalization, and provide for parallel VCI matrix
   construction to reduce required wall times.

  abstract = {Duo is a general, user-friendly program for computing rotational, rovibrational and rovibronic spectra of diatomic molecules. Duo solves the Schr�dinger equation for the motion of the nuclei not only for the simple case of uncoupled, isolated electronic states (typical for the ground state of closed-shell diatomics) but also for the general case of an arbitrary number and type of couplings between electronic states (typical for open-shell diatomics and excited states). Possible couplings include spin�orbit, angular momenta, spin-rotational and spin�spin. Corrections due to non-adiabatic effects can be accounted for by introducing the relevant couplings using so-called Born�Oppenheimer breakdown curves. Duo requires user-specified potential energy curves and, if relevant, dipole moment, coupling and correction curves. From these it computes energy levels, line positions and line intensities. Several analytic forms plus interpolation and extrapolation options are available for representation of the curves. Duo can refine potential energy and coupling curves to best reproduce reference data such as experimental energy levels or line positions. Duo is provided as a Fortran�2003 program and has been tested under a variety of operating systems.

  journal = ApJ,
  abstract = {This work aims to improve the current understanding of the atmospheres of brown dwarfs, especially cold ones with spectral types T and Y, whose modeling is a current challenge. Silicate and iron clouds are believed to disappear at the photosphere at the L/T transition, but cloudless models fail to reproduce correctly the spectra of T dwarfs, advocating for the addition of more physics, e.g., other types of clouds or internal energy transport mechanisms. We use a one-dimensional radiative/convective equilibrium code ATMO to investigate this issue. This code includes both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium chemistry and solves consistently the PT structure. Included opacity sources are H2-H2, H2-He, H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, NH3, K, Na, and TiO, VO if they are present in the atmosphere. We show that the spectra of Y dwarfs can be accurately reproduced with a cloudless model if vertical mixing and NH3 quenching are taken into account. T dwarf spectra still have some reddening in, e.g., J–H, compared to cloudless models. This reddening can be reproduced by slightly reducing the temperature gradient in the atmosphere. We propose that this reduction of the stabilizing temperature gradient in these layers, leading to cooler structures, is due to the onset of fingering convection, triggered by the destabilizing impact of condensation of very thin dust.}

  abstract ={Exoplanet atmosphere spectroscopy enables us to improve our understanding of exoplanets just as remote sensing in our own solar system has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and molecular abundances allowed by the data, which is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra that commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of spectral retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. We compare three different retrieval methods: optimal estimation, differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo, and bootstrap Monte Carlo on a synthetic water-dominated hot Jupiter. We discuss expectations of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current and potential future observations. In general, we find that the three approaches agree for high spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise data expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra representative of current observations. We also compare the results from a parameterized temperature profile versus a full classical Level-by-Level approach and discriminate in which situations each of these approaches is applicable. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C-to-O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres. Specifically, we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased toward values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.}

This model is able to compute non-LTE populations for vibrational, rotational, spin (i.e., NO and OH), and electronic (i.e., O2) states in a given planetary atmosphere. The model is very flexible and can be used for computing very accurate non-LTE populations or for calculating reasonably accurate but at high speed non-LTE populations in order to implement it into non-LTE remote sensing retrievals. We describe the model in detail and present an update of the non-LTE collisional processes and their rate coefficients for the most important molecules in Earth's atmosphere. In addition, we have applied the model to the most important atmospheric infrared emitters including 13 species (H2O, CO2, O3, N2O, CO, CH4, O2, NO, NO2, HNO3, OH, N2, and HCN) and 460 excited vibrational or electronic energy levels. Non-LTE populations for all these energy levels have been calculated for 48 reference atmospheres expanding from the surface up to 200km, including seasonal (January, April, July and October), latitudinal (75°S, 45°S, 10°S, 10°N, 45°N, 75°N) and diurnal (day and night) coverages. The effects of the most recent updates of the non-LTE collisional parameters on the non-LTE populations are briefly described. This climatology is available online to the community and it can be used for estimating non-LTE effects at specific conditions and for testing and validation studies.}

   wavefunctions. The vibrational step uses successive diagonalisation and
   truncation which is implemented for a number of possible coordinate
   orderings. The rotational, expectation value and transition dipole
   programs exploit the savings offered by performing integrals on a DVR
   grid. The new version has been rewritten in FORTRAN 90 to exploit the
   dynamic array allocations and the algorithm for dipole and spectra
   calculations have been substantially improved. New modules allow the
   z-axis to be embedded perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and for
   the calculation of expectation values.},

  abstract = {A review is given on the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
	(MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24
	(!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	(CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed. },

  abstract = {A description is given of an algorithm for computing rovibrational
	energy levels for tetratomic molecules. The expressions required
	for evaluating transition intensities are also given. The variational
	principle is used to determine the energy levels, and the kinetic
	energy operator is simple and evaluated exactly. The computational
	procedure is split up into the determination of one-dimensional radial
	basis functions, the computation of a contracted rotational-bending
	basis, followed by a final variational step coupling all degrees
	of freedom. An angular basis is proposed whereby the rotational-bending
	contraction takes place in three steps. Angular matrix elements of
	the potential are evaluated by expansion in terms of a suitable basis,
	and the angular integrals are given in a factorized form which simplifies
	their evaluation. The basis functions in the final variational step
	have the full permutation symmetries of the identical particles.
	Sample results are given for HCCH and BH3.}
