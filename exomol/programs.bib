abstract = {Duo is a general, user-friendly program for computing rotational, rovibrational and rovibronic spectra of diatomic molecules. Duo solves the Schr�dinger equation for the motion of the nuclei not only for the simple case of uncoupled, isolated electronic states (typical for the ground state of closed-shell diatomics) but also for the general case of an arbitrary number and type of couplings between electronic states (typical for open-shell diatomics and excited states). Possible couplings include spin�orbit, angular momenta, spin-rotational and spin�spin. Corrections due to non-adiabatic effects can be accounted for by introducing the relevant couplings using so-called Born�Oppenheimer breakdown curves. Duo requires user-specified potential energy curves and, if relevant, dipole moment, coupling and correction curves. From these it computes energy levels, line positions and line intensities. Several analytic forms plus interpolation and extrapolation options are available for representation of the curves. Duo can refine potential energy and coupling curves to best reproduce reference data such as experimental energy levels or line positions. Duo is provided as a Fortran�2003 program and has been tested under a variety of operating systems.

Abstract = {The DVR3D program suite calculates energy levels, wavefunctions, and

   surfaces must be provided. Expectation values of geometrically defined
   functions can be calculated, a feature which is particularly useful for
   fitting potential energy surfaces. The programs use an exact (within the
   Born-Oppenheimer approximation) Hamiltonian and offer a choice of Jacobi
   or Radau internal coordinates and several body-fixed axes. Rotationally
   excited states are treated using an efficient two-step algorithm. The
   programs uses a Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) based on
   Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for all 3 internal
   coordinates and thus yields a fully point-wise representation of the
   wavefunctions. The vibrational step uses successive diagonalisation and
   truncation which is implemented for a number of possible coordinate
   orderings. The rotational, expectation value and transition dipole
   programs exploit the savings offered by performing integrals on a DVR
   grid. The new version has been rewritten in FORTRAN 90 to exploit the
   dynamic array allocations and the algorithm for dipole and spectra
   calculations have been substantially improved. New modules allow the
   z-axis to be embedded perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and for
   the calculation of expectation values.},

Many different interactions can be included in the calculation, including those arising from electron and nuclear spin, and external electric and magnetic fields. Multiple states and interactions between them can also be accounted for, limited only by available memory. Fitting of experimental data can be to line positions (in many common formats), intensities or band contours and the parameters determined can be level populations as well as rotational constants. pgopher is provided with a powerful and flexible graphical user interface to simplify many of the tasks required in simulating, understanding and fitting molecular spectra, including Fortrat diagrams and energy level plots in addition to overlaying experimental and simulated spectra. The program is open source, and can be compiled with open source tools. This paper provides a formal description of the operation of version 9.1. }

   Nature of problem: The simulation of accurate molecular vibrational
   spectra is a significant and long-standing problem in computational
   chemistry. There are two major challenges: constructing an accurate ab
   initio potential energy surface and solving the nuclear vibrational
   problem. Both scale poorly with respect to molecular size, requiring
   large amounts of CPU time and memory.
   Solution method: We have implemented a straightforward numerical
   differentiation algorithm to construct quartic force fields in normal
   mode coordinates using second derivatives of the energy with respect to
   nuclear displacement obtained from ab initio quantum chemical
   calculations, for nuclear vibrational structure algorithm development
   and testing purposes. We have also provided an interface to the PyPES
   library of high quality semi-global potential energy surfaces, which
   enable quantitative prediction of molecular vibrational spectra. To
   solve the nuclear vibrational problem, we use a vibrational
   configuration interaction algorithm in a harmonic oscillator basis.
   Unusual features: One of the unusual features of our code is its
   flexibility, with multiple ways of generating or supplying force field
   data, dynamic memory allocation, adjustable screening thresholds, and
   explicit user control over terms in the VCI wave-function (maximum
   excitation level and extent of mode coupling). We employ sparse matrix
   linear algebra libraries to reduce the memory required for VCI matrix
   storage and diagonalization, and provide for parallel VCI matrix
   construction to reduce required wall times.

  abstract={We present the open-source radiative transfer code named HELIOS , which is constructed for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. In its initial version, the model atmospheres of HELIOS are one-dimensional and plane-parallel, and the equation of radiative transfer is solved in the two-stream approximation with nonisotropic scattering. A small set of the main infrared absorbers is employed, computed with the opacity calculator HELIOS-K and combined using a correlated- k approximation. The molecular abundances originate from validated analytical formulae for equilibrium chemistry. We compare HELIOS with the work of Miller-Ricci & Fortney using a model of GJ 1214b, and perform several tests, where we find: model atmospheres with single-temperature layers struggle to converge to radiative equilibrium; k -distribution tables constructed with ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/2/56/ajaa5179ieqn1.gif] {$\gtrsim 0.01$} cm −1 resolution in the opacity function ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/2/56/ajaa5179ieqn2.gif] {$\lesssim {10}^{3}$} points per wavenumber bin) may result in errors ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/153/2/56/ajaa5179ieqn3.gif] {$\gtrsim 1$} %–10% in the synthetic spectra; and a diffusivity factor of 2 approximates well the exact radiative transfer solution in the limit of pure absorption. We construct “null-hypothesis” models (chemical equilibrium, radiative equilibrium, and solar elemental abundances) for six hot Jupiters. We find that the dayside emission spectra of HD 189733b and WASP-43b are consistent with the null hypothesis, while the latter consistently underpredicts the observed fluxes of WASP-8b, WASP-12b, WASP-14b, and WASP-33b. We demonstrate that our results are somewhat insensitive to the choice of stellar models (blackbody, Kurucz, or PHOENIX ) and metallicity, but are strongly affected by higher carbon-to-oxygen ratios.

   investigate the chemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which
   are expected to be driven away from chemical equilibrium via processes
   such as vertical mixing and photochemistry. All of these models have so
   far used pressure temperature (P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This
   results in a decoupling of the chemistry from the radiative and thermal
   properties of the atmosphere, despite the fact that in nature they are
   intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional radiative-convective
   equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated chemistry scheme
   to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with
   non-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and
   photochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong
   chemical disequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences
   in the P-T profile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived
   assuming chemical equilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn,
   have important consequences for the chemical abundances themselves as
   well as for the simulated emission spectra. In particular, we find that
   performing the chemical kinetics calculation consistently can reduce the
   overall impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on the observable emission
   spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated observations derived from
   non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong interpretation. We show
   that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models violating the
   energy budget balance of the atmosphere.}},

  abstract={Exoplanet atmosphere spectroscopy enables us to improve our understanding of exoplanets just as remote sensing in our own solar system has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and molecular abundances allowed by the data, which is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra that commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of spectral retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. We compare three different retrieval methods: optimal estimation, differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo, and bootstrap Monte Carlo on a synthetic water-dominated hot Jupiter. We discuss expectations of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current and potential future observations. In general, we find that the three approaches agree for high spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise data expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra representative of current observations. We also compare the results from a parameterized temperature profile versus a full classical Level-by-Level approach and discriminate in which situations each of these approaches is applicable. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C-to-O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres. Specifically, we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased toward values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors.}

abstract = {Abstract SpectraPlot is a web-based application for simulating spectra of atomic and molecular gases. At the time this manuscript was written, SpectraPlot consisted of four primary tools for calculating: 1) atomic and molecular absorption spectra, 2) atomic and molecular emission spectra, 3) transition linestrengths, and 4) blackbody emission spectra. These tools currently employ the NIST ASD, HITRAN2012, and HITEMP2010 databases to perform line-by-line simulations of spectra. SpectraPlot employs a modular, integrated architecture, enabling multiple simulations across multiple databases and/or thermodynamic conditions to be visualized in a single interactive plot window. The primary objective of this paper is to describe the architecture and spectroscopic models employed by SpectraPlot in order to provide its users with the knowledge required to understand the capabilities and limitations of simulations performed using SpectraPlot. Further, this manuscript discusses the accuracy of several underlying approximations used to decrease computational time, namely, the use of far-wing cutoff criteria. }

	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance

	MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24
	(!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	(CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed. },
