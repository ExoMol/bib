Abstract = {Calculating dipole transition intensities or the related Einstein A
   coefficients can dominate the computer usage for large line lists of
   transitions such as those being computed to model radiative transport
   through hot atmospheres. An algorithm for the efficient computation of
   line strengths is presented based on the use of the half-linestrength.
   This is implemented on GPUs that are shown to give up to a thousandfold
   speed-up compared to calculations on conventional computers. This
   algorithm is implemented in the program GAIN which was developed as part
   of the TROVE nuclear motion program, but can be adapted for use by other
   similar programs in a straightforward fashion.

Abstract = {The use of variational nuclear motion programs to compute line lists of
   transition frequencies and intensities is now a standard procedure. The
   ExoMol project has used this technique to generate line lists for
   studies of hot bodies such as the atmospheres of exoplanets and cool
   stars. The resulting line list can be huge: many contain 10 billion or
   more transitions. This software update considers changes made to our
   programs during the course of the project to allow for such
   calculations. This update considers three programs: Duo which computed
   vibronic spectra for diatomics, DVR3D which computes rotation-vibration
   spectra for triatomics, and TROVE which computes rotation-vibration
   spectra for general polyatomic systems. Important updates in
   functionality include the calculation of quasibound (resonance) states
   and Lande g-factors by Duo and the calculation of resonance states by
   DVR3D. Significant algorithmic improvements are reported for both DVR3D
   and TROVE. All three programs are publically available from
   ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk. Future developments are also considered.},
