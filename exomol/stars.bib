Abstract = {{Composition of distant stars can be explored by observing absorption
   spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through
   the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic
   absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic
   composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with
   known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids,
   comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner.
   Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so
   bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density
   does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal
   generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular
   composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The
   concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a
   distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With
   sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature
   rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface
   occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and
   ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk
   composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated
   spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be
   created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot
   continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition
   profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with
   laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.}},
