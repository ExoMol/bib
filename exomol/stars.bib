   Abstract = {Determining the habitability and interpreting atmospheric spectra of
      exoplanets requires understanding their atmospheric physics and
      chemistry. We use a 3-D coupled climate-chemistry model, the Met Office
      Unified Model with the UK Chemistry and Aerosols framework, to study the
      emergence of lightning and its chemical impact on tidally-locked
      Earth-like exoplanets. We simulate the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b
      orbiting in the Habitable Zone of its M-dwarf star, but the results
      apply to similar M-dwarf orbiting planets. Our chemical network includes
      the Chapman ozone reactions and hydrogen oxide (HOx = H + OH + HO2) and
      nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) catalytic cycles. We find that
      photochemistry driven by stellar radiation (177-850 nm) supports a
      global ozone layer between 20-50 km. We parametrize lightning flashes as
      a function of cloud-top height and the resulting production of nitric
      oxide (NO) from the thermal decomposition of N-2 and O-2. Rapid dayside
      convection over and around the substellar point results in lightning
      flash rates of up to 0.16 flashes km(-2) yr(-1), enriching the dayside
      atmosphere below altitudes of 20 km in NOx. Changes in dayside ozone are
      determined mainly by UV irradiance and the HOx catalytic cycle. similar
      to 45 per cent of the planetary dayside surface remains at habitable
      temperatures (T-surf > 273.15K), and the ozone layer reduces surface UV
      radiation levels to 15 per cent. Dayside-nightside thermal gradients
      result in strong winds that subsequently advect NOx towards the
      nightside, where the absence of photochemistry allows NOx chemistry to
      involve reservoir species. Our study also emphasizes the need for
      accurate UV stellar spectra to understand the atmospheric chemistry of
      exoplanets.},

We report nondetections of starspots on the Sun even when the Sun was spotted, the solar twin 18 Scorpii, and the very spotted Sun-like star HAT-P-11, suggesting that Sun-like starspot distributions will be invisible to the CCF technique, and should not produce molecular absorption signals that might be confused for signatures of exoplanet atmospheres. We detect strong TiO absorption in the T Tauri K-dwarfs LkCa 4 and AA Tau, consistent with significant coverage by cool regions. We show that despite the nondetections, the technique is sensitive to relatively small spot coverages on M dwarfs and large starspot areas on Sun-like stars.}

   Abstract = {{Composition of distant stars can be explored by observing absorption
   spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through
   the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic
   absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic
   composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with
   known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids,
   comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner.
   Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so
   bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density
   does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal
   generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular
   composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The
   concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a
   distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With
   sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature
   rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface
   occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and
   ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk
   composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated
   spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be
   created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot
   continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition
   profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with
   laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.}},
