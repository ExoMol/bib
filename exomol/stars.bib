Abstract = {Determining the habitability and interpreting atmospheric spectra of
   exoplanets requires understanding their atmospheric physics and
   chemistry. We use a 3-D coupled climate-chemistry model, the Met Office
   Unified Model with the UK Chemistry and Aerosols framework, to study the
   emergence of lightning and its chemical impact on tidally-locked
   Earth-like exoplanets. We simulate the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b
   orbiting in the Habitable Zone of its M-dwarf star, but the results
   apply to similar M-dwarf orbiting planets. Our chemical network includes
   the Chapman ozone reactions and hydrogen oxide (HOx = H + OH + HO2) and
   nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) catalytic cycles. We find that
   photochemistry driven by stellar radiation (177-850 nm) supports a
   global ozone layer between 20-50 km. We parametrize lightning flashes as
   a function of cloud-top height and the resulting production of nitric
   oxide (NO) from the thermal decomposition of N-2 and O-2. Rapid dayside
   convection over and around the substellar point results in lightning
   flash rates of up to 0.16 flashes km(-2) yr(-1), enriching the dayside
   atmosphere below altitudes of 20 km in NOx. Changes in dayside ozone are
   determined mainly by UV irradiance and the HOx catalytic cycle. similar
   to 45 per cent of the planetary dayside surface remains at habitable
   temperatures (T-surf > 273.15K), and the ozone layer reduces surface UV
   radiation levels to 15 per cent. Dayside-nightside thermal gradients
   result in strong winds that subsequently advect NOx towards the
   nightside, where the absence of photochemistry allows NOx chemistry to
   involve reservoir species. Our study also emphasizes the need for
   accurate UV stellar spectra to understand the atmospheric chemistry of
   exoplanets.},

	abstract = {We present a method for detecting starspots on cool stars using the cross-correlation function (CCF) of high-resolution molecular spectral templates applied to archival high-resolution spectra of G and K stars observed with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS)/HARPS-N. We report nondetections of starspots on the Sun even when the Sun was spotted, the solar twin 18 Scorpii, and the very spotted Sun-like star HAT-P-11, suggesting that Sun-like starspot distributions will be invisible to the CCF technique, and should not produce molecular absorption signals that might be confused for signatures of exoplanet atmospheres. We detect strong TiO absorption in the T Tauri K-dwarfs LkCa 4 and AA Tau, consistent with significant coverage by cool regions. We show that despite the nondetections, the technique is sensitive to relatively small spot coverages on M dwarfs and large starspot areas on Sun-like stars.}

Abstract = {{Composition of distant stars can be explored by observing absorption
   spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through
   the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic
   absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic
   composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with
   known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids,
   comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner.
   Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so
   bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density
   does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal
   generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular
   composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The
   concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a
   distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With
   sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature
   rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface
   occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and
   ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk
   composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated
   spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be
   created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot
   continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition
   profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with
   laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.}},
