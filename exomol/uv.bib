Title = {{Search for an exosphere in sodium and calcium in the transmission
   spectrum of exoplanet 55 Cancri e}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{593}},
Abstract = {{Context. The atmospheric and surface characterization of rocky planets
   is a key goal of exoplanet science. Unfortunately, the measurements
   required for this are generally out of reach of present-day
   instrumentation. However, the planet Mercury in our own solar system
   exhibits a large exosphere composed of atomic species that have been
   ejected from the planetary surface by the process of sputtering. Since
   the hottest rocky exoplanets known so far are more than an order of
   magnitude closer to their parent star than Mercury is to the Sun, the
   sputtering process and the resulting exospheres could be orders of
   magnitude larger and potentially detectable using transmission
   spectroscopy, indirectly probing their surface compositions.
   Aims. The aim of this work is to search for an absorption signal from
   exospheric sodium (Na) and singly ionized calcium (Ca+) in the optical
   transmission spectrum of the hot rocky super-Earth 55 Cancri e. Although
   the current best-fitting models to the planet mass and radius require a
   possible atmospheric component, uncertainties in the radius exist,
   making it possible that 55 Cancri e could be a hot rocky planet without
   an atmosphere.
   Methods. High resolution (R similar to 110 000) time-series spectra of
   five transits of 55 Cancri e, obtained with three different telescopes
   (UVES/VLT, HARPS/ESO 3.6 m and HARPS-N/TNG) were analysed. Targeting the
   sodium D lines and the calcium H and K lines, the potential planet
   exospheric signal was filtered out from the much stronger stellar and
   telluric signals, making use of the change of the radial component of
   the orbital velocity of the planet over the transit from -57 to +57 km
   s(-1).
   Results. Combining all five transit data sets, we detect a signal
   potentially associated with sodium in the planet exosphere at a
   statistical significance level of 3 sigma. Combining the four HARPS
   transits that cover the calcium H and K lines, we also find a potential
   signal from ionized calcium (4.1 sigma). Interestingly, this latter
   signal originates from just one of the transit measurements with a 4.9
   sigma detection at this epoch. Unfortunately, due to the low
   significance of the measured sodium signal and the potentially variable
   Ca+ signal, we estimate the p-values of these signals to be too high
   (corresponding to <4 sigma) to claim unambiguous exospheric detections.
   By comparing the observed signals with artificial signals injected early
   in the analysis, the absorption by Na and Ca+ are estimated to be at a
   level of similar to 2.3 x 10(-3) and similar to 7.0 x 10(-2)
   respectively, relative to the stellar spectrum.
   Conclusions. If confirmed, the 3 sigma signal would correspond to an
   optically thick sodium exosphere with a radius of 5 R-circle plus, which
   is comparable to the Roche lobe radius of the planet. The 4.9 sigma
   detection of Ca+ in a single HARPS data set would correspond to an
   optically thick Ca+ exosphere approximately five times larger than the
   Roche lobe radius. If this were a real detection, it would imply that
   the exosphere exhibits extreme variability. Although no formal detection
   has been made, we advocate that probing the exospheres of hot
   super-Earths in this way has great potential, also knowing that
   Mercury's exosphere varies significantly over time. It may be a fast
   route towards the first characterization of the surface properties of
   this enigmatic class of planets.}},

Title = {{The Mg I line: a new probe of the atmospheres of evaporating exoplanets}},
Journal = AA,

Volume = {{573}},
Abstract = {{Transit observations of HD 209458b in the UV revealed signatures of
   neutral magnesium escaping the planet's upper atmosphere. The absorption
   detected in the Mg I line provides unprecedented information on the
   physical conditions at the altitude where the atmospheric blow-off takes
   place. Here we use a 3D model of atmospheric escape to estimate the
   transit absorption signatures in the Mg I line of their host stars. The
   detectability of these signatures depends on the brightness of the star
   and the escape rate of neutral magnesium. We identify a sample of
   potentially evaporating exoplanets that covers a wide range of stellar
   and planetary properties, and whose extended exospheres might be
   detected through Mg I line observations with current UV facilities,
   allowing further steps in comparative exoplanetology.}},

Abstract = {{The success of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) first and

   wavelengths had and are having on modern astronomy. Several discoveries
   in the exoplanet field have been done at UV wavelengths. Nevertheless,
   the amount of data collected in this band is still limited both in terms
   of observed targets and time spent on each of them. For the next decade,
   the post-HST era, the only large (2-m class) space telescope capable of
   UV observations will be the World Space Observatory-UltraViolet
   (WSO-UV). In its characteristics, the WSO-UV mission is similar to that
   of HST, but all observing time will be dedicated to UV astronomy. In
   this work, we briefly outline the major prospects of the WSO-UV mission
   in terms of exoplanet studies. To the limits of the data and tools
   currently available, here we also compare the quality of key exoplanet

Abstract = {{The EUV (200-911 ), FUV (912-1750 ), and NUV (1750-3200 ) spectral

   the dissociation of H2O and CO2, the production of O-2 and O-3, and may

   importance of this information for atmospheric modeling of exoplanetary
   systems, the EUV/FUV/NUV radiation fields of cool (K and M dwarf)

Title = {FLUCTUATIONS AND FLARES IN THE ULTRAVIOLET LINE EMISSION OF COOL STARS:
   IMPLICATIONS FOR EXOPLANET TRANSIT OBSERVATIONS},
Journal = ApJS,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{211}},
Abstract = {{Variations in stellar flux can potentially overwhelm the photometric
   signal of a transiting planet. Such variability has not previously been
   well-characterized in the ultraviolet lines used to probe the inflated
   atmospheres surrounding hot Jupiters. Therefore, we surveyed 38 F-M
   stars for intensity variations in four narrow spectroscopic bands: two
   enclosing strong lines from species known to inhabit hot Jupiter
   atmospheres, CII lambda lambda 1334, 1335 and Si III lambda 1206; one
   enclosing Si IV lambda lambda 1393, 1402; and 36.5 angstrom of
   interspersed continuum. For each star/band combination, we generated 60
   s cadence lightcurves from archival Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic
   Origins Spectrograph and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
   time-tagged photon data. Within these lightcurves, we characterized
   flares and stochastic fluctuations as separate forms of variability.
   Flares: we used a cross-correlation approach to detect 116 flares. These
   events occur in the time-series an average of once per 2.5 hr, over 50\%
   last 4 minutes or less, and most produce the strongest response in Si
   IV. If the flare occurred during a transit measurement integrated for 60
   minutes, 90/116 would destroy the signal of an Earth, 27/116 Neptune,
   and 7/116 Jupiter, with the upward bias in flux ranging from 1\% to
   109\% of quiescent levels. Fluctuations: photon noise and underlying
   stellar fluctuations produce scatter in the quiescent data. We model the
   stellar fluctuations as Gaussian white noise with standard deviation
   sigma(x). Maximum likelihood values of sigma(x) range from 1\% to 41\%
   for 60 s measurements. These values suggest that many cool stars will
   only permit a transit detection to high confidence in ultraviolet
   resonance lines if the radius of the occulting disk is greater than or
   similar to 1 R-J. However, for some M dwarfs this limit can be as low as
   several R-circle plus.}},

Title = {{Hubble Space Telescope detection of oxygen in the atmosphere of
   exoplanet HD189733b}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{553}},
Abstract = {{Detecting heavy atoms in the inflated atmospheres of giant exoplanets
   that orbit close to their parent stars is a key factor for understanding
   their bulk composition, their evolution, and the processes that drive
   their expansion and interaction with the impinging stellar wind.
   Unfortunately, very few detections have been made thus far. Here, we use
   archive data obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the
   Hubble Space Telescope to report an absorption of similar to
   6.4\%+/-1.8\% by neutral oxygen during the HD189733b transit. Using
   published results from a simple hydrodynamic model of HD189733b, and
   assuming a mean temperature of similar to(8-12) x 10(3) K for the upper
   atmosphere of the exoplanet, a mean vertical integrated OI density
   column of similar to 8x10(15) cm(-2) produces only a 3.5\% attenuation
   transit. Much like the case of the hot-Jupiter HD209458b, super-solar
   abundances and/or super-thermal broadening of the absorption lines are
   required to fit the deep transit drop-off observed in most
   far-ultraviolet lines. We also report evidence of short-time variability
   in the measured stellar flux, a variability that we analyze using time
   series derived from the time-tagged exposures, which we then compare to
   solar flaring activity. In that frame, we find that non-statistical
   uncertainties in the measured fluxes are not negligible, which calls for
   caution when reporting transit absorptions. Despite cumulative
   uncertainties that originate from variability in the stellar and sky
   background signals and in the instrument response, we also show a
   possible detection for both a transit and early-ingress absorption in
   the ion C II 133.5 nm lines. If confirmed, this would be the second
   exoplanet for which an early ingress absorption is reported. In
   contrast, such an early ingress signature is not detected for neutral
   OI. Assuming the HD189733b magnetosphere to be at the origin of the
   early absorption, we use the Parker model for the stellar wind and a
   particle-in-cell code for the magnetosphere to show that its orientation
   should be deflected similar to 10-30 degrees from the planet-star line,
   while its nose's position should be at least similar to 16.7 R-p
   upstream of the exoplanet in order to fit the C II transit light curve.
   The derived stand-off distance is consistent with a surface magnetic
   field strength of similar to 5.3 Gauss for the exoplanet, and a
   supersonic stellar wind impinging at similar to 250 km s(-1), with a
   temperature of 1.2 x 10(5) K and a density similar to 6.3 x 10(6) cm(-3)
   at the planetary orbit, yet the fit is not unique.}},

Title = {{Magnesium in the atmosphere of the planet HD209458 b: observations of
   the thermosphere-exosphere transition region}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{560}},
Abstract = {{The planet HD209458 b is one of the most well studied hot-Jupiter
   exoplanets. The upper atmosphere of this planet has been observed
   through ultraviolet/optical transit observations with Hi observation of
   the exosphere revealing atmospheric escape. At lower altitudes just
   below the thermosphere, detailed observations of the Na I absorption
   line has revealed an atmospheric thermal inversion. This thermal
   structure is rising toward high temperatures at high altitudes, as
   predicted by models of the thermosphere, and could reach similar to 10
   000 K at the exobase level. Here, we report new near ultraviolet Hubble
   Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS)
   observations of atmospheric absorptions during the planetary transit of
   HD209458 b.
   We report absorption in atomic magnesium (Mg I), while no signal has
   been detected in the lines of singly ionized magnesium (Mg II). We
   measure the Mg I atmospheric absorption to be 6.2 +/- 2.9\% in the
   velocity range from -62 to -19 km s(-1). The detection of atomic
   magnesium in the planetary upper atmosphere at a distance of several
   planetary radii gives a first view into the transition region between
   the thermosphere and the exobase, where atmospheric escape takes place.
   We estimate the electronic densities needed to compensate for the
   photo-ionization by dielectronic recombination of Mg+ to be in the range
   of 10(8)-10(9) cm(-3). Our finding is in excellent agreement with model
   predictions at altitudes of several planetary radii.
   We observe Mg I atoms escaping the planet, with a maximum radial
   velocity (in the stellar rest frame) of -60 km s(-1). Because magnesium
   is much heavier than hydrogen, the escape of this species confirms
   previous studies that the planet's atmosphere is undergoing hydrodynamic
   escape. We compare our observations to a numerical model that takes the
   stellar radiation pressure on the Mg I atoms into account. We find that
   the Mg I atoms must be present at up to similar to 7.5 planetari radii
   altitude and estimate an Mg I escape rate of similar to 3 x 10(7) g
   s(-1). Compared to previous evaluations of the escape rate of Hi atoms,
   this evaluation is compatible with a magnesium abundance roughly solar.
   A hint of absorption, detected at low level of significance, during the
   post-transit observations, could be interpreted as a Mg I cometary-like
   tail. If true, the estimate of the absorption by Mg I would be increased
   to a higher value of about 8.8 +/- 2.1\%.}},

Journal = ApJ,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{714}},
Pages = {L222-L227},
Abstract = {{We present near-UV transmission spectroscopy of the highly irradiated
   transiting exoplanet WASP-12b, obtained with the Cosmic Origins
   Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. The spectra cover three
   distinct wavelength ranges: NUVA (2539-2580 angstrom), NUVB (2655-2696
   angstrom), and NUVC (2770-2811 angstrom). Three independent methods all
   reveal enhanced transit depths attributable to absorption by resonance
   lines of metals in the exosphere of WASP-12b. Light curves of total
   counts in the NUVA and NUVC wavelength ranges show a detection at a 2.5
   sigma level. We detect extra absorption in the Mg II lambda lambda 2800
   resonance line cores at the 2.8 sigma level. The NUVA, NUVB, and NUVC
   light curves imply effective radii of 2.69 +/- 0.24 R(J), 2.18 +/- 0.18
   R(J), and 2.66 +/- 0.22 R(J) respectively, suggesting the planet is
   surrounded by an absorbing cloud which overfills the Roche lobe. We
   detect enhanced transit depths at the wavelengths of resonance lines of
   neutral sodium, tin, and manganese, and at singly ionized ytterbium,
   scandium, manganese, aluminum, vanadium, and magnesium. We also find the
   statistically expected number of anomalous transit depths at wavelengths
   not associated with any known resonance line. Our data are limited by
   photon noise, but taken as a whole the results are strong evidence for
   an extended absorbing exosphere surrounding the planet. The NUVA data
   exhibit an early ingress, contrary to model expectations; we speculate
   this could be due to the presence of a disk of previously stripped
   material.}},
