Abstract = {{With the growth in sensitivity and angular resolution of millimeter and
   submillimeter telescopes, the number of unidentified molecular spectral
   lines in surveys of the interstellar medium has grown rapidly. While
   some of these unidentified lines are due to as yet unidentified
   astrophysical species, it is the general consensus that most are due to
   lines from a limited number of well-known interstellar species, the
   interstellar weeds. These unidentified lines do not appear in
   astrophysical line catalogs, which are based on quantum mechanical
   models and are incomplete primarily because of the difficulty of
   performing the usual bootstrap assignment and analysis process in their
   often highly perturbed low-lying vibrational states. To address this
   problem, we have proposed and demonstrated an alternative catalog
   approach that is based on the analysis of intensity-calibrated spectra
   taken over a range of temperatures in the laboratory. These analyses
   also make it possible to quantitatively address the astrophysical
   completeness of existing catalogs. In this Letter, we use extensive new
   experimental data in the 210-270 GHz window to address this question for
   eight molecules that are considered to be the leading candidates for
   astronomical weeds-methyl formate, methanol, dimethyl ether,
   acetaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, methyl cyanide, vinyl cyanide, and ethyl
   cyanide. Additionally, for each of the eight molecules, we use these
   results and knowledge of the molecular vibrational/torsional energy
   levels to predict completeness as a function of astronomical source
   temperature.}},
