Abstract = {{A new experimental setup coupling a High Enthalpy Source (HES) reaching
   2000 K to a cw-cavity ring-down spectrometer has been developed to
   investigate rotationally cold hot bands of polyatomic molecules in the
   {[}1.5,1.7] mu m region. The rotational and vibrational molecular
   degrees of freedom are strongly decoupled in the hypersonic expansion
   produced by the HES and probed by cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Carbon
   monoxide has been used as a first test molecule to validate the
   experimental approach. Its expansion in argon led to rotational and
   vibrational temperatures of 6.7 +/- 0.8 K and 2006 +/- 476 K,
   respectively. The tetradecad polyad of methane (1.67 mu m) was
   investigated under similar conditions leading to rotational and
   vibrational temperatures of 13 +/- 5 K and 750 +/- 100 K, respectively.
   The rotationally cold structure of the spectra reveals many hot bands
   involving highly excited vibrational states of methane. }},

Abstract = {{Composition of distant stars can be explored by observing absorption
   spectra. Stars produce nearly blackbody radiation that passes through
   the cloud of vaporized material surrounding the star. Characteristic
   absorption lines are discernible with a spectrometer, and atomic
   composition is investigated by comparing spectral observations with
   known material profiles. Most objects in the solar system asteroids,
   comets, planets, moons are too cold to be interrogated in this manner.
   Material clouds around cold objects consist primarily of volatiles, so
   bulk composition cannot be probed. Additionally, low volatile density
   does not produce discernible absorption lines in the faint signal
   generated by cold objects. We propose a system for probing the molecular
   composition of cold solar system targets from a distant vantage. The
   concept utilizes a directed energy beam to melt and vaporize a spot on a
   distant target, such as from a spacecraft orbiting the object. With
   sufficient flux (-10 MW/m2) on a rocky asteroid, the spot temperature
   rises rapidly to 2500 K, and evaporation of all materials on the surface
   occurs. The melted spot creates a high-temperature blackbody source, and
   ejected material creates a molecular plume in front of the spot. Bulk
   composition is investigated by using a spectrometer to view the heated
   spot through the ejected material. Spatial composition maps could be
   created by scanning the surface. Applying the beam to a single spot
   continuously produces a borehole, and shallow sub-surface composition
   profiling is possible. Initial simulations of absorption profiles with
   laser heating show great promise for molecular composition analysis.}},

Title = {{On the relative absorption strengths of water vapour in the blue
   wavelength range}},
Journal = {Atmos. Meas. Tech.},
Year = {{2015}},
Pages = {4329-4346},
Abstract = {{In recent updates of the HITRAN water vapour H2O spectroscopic
   compilation covering the blue spectral region (here: 394-480 nm)
   significant changes for the absorption bands at 416 and 426 nm were
   reported. In order to investigate the consistency of the different
   cross-sections calculated from these compilations, H2O vapour column
   density ratios for different spectral intervals were retrieved from
   long-path and multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy
   (DOAS) measurements. We observed a significant improvement of the DOAS
   evaluation when using the updated HITRAN water vapour absorption
   cross-sections for the calculation of the reference spectra. In
   particular the magnitudes of the residual spectra as well as the fit
   errors were reduced.
   However, we also found that the best match between measurement and model
   is reached when the absorption cross-section of groups of lines are
   scaled by factors ranging from 0.5 to 1.9, suggesting that the HITRAN
   water vapour absorption compilation still needs significant corrections.
   For this spectral region we present correction factors for HITRAN 2009,
   HITRAN 2012, HITEMP and BT2 derived from field measurements.
   Additionally, upper limits for water vapour absorption in the UV-A range
   from 330 to 390 nm are given.}},

Title = {{GARLIC - A general purpose atmospheric radiative transfer line-by-line
   infrared-microwave code: Implementation and evaluation}},
Journal = JQSRT,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {29-50},
Abstract = {{A suite of programs for high resolution infrared-microwave atmospheric
   radiative transfer modeling has been developed with emphasis on
   efficient and reliable numerical algorithms and a modular approach
   appropriate for simulation and/or retrieval in a variety of
   applications. The Generic Atmospheric Radiation Line-by-line Infrared
   Code - GARLIC - is suitable for arbitrary observation geometry,
   instrumental field-of-view, and line shape. The core of GARLIC's
   subroutines constitutes the basis of forward models used to implement
   inversion codes to retrieve atmospheric state parameters from limb and
   nadir sounding instruments.
   This paper briefly introduces the physical and mathematical basics of
   GARLIC and its descendants and continues with an in-depth presentation
   of various implementation aspects: An optimized Voigt function algorithm
   combined with a two-grid approach is used to accelerate the line-by-line
   modeling of molecular cross sections; various quadrature methods are
   implemented to evaluate the Schwarzschild and Beer integrals; and
   Jacobians, i.e. derivatives with respect to the unknowns of the
   atmospheric inverse problem, are implemented by means of automatic
   differentiation. For an assessment of GARLIC's performance, a comparison
   of the quadrature methods for solution of the path integral is provided.
   Verification and validation are demonstrated using intercomparisons with
   other line-by-line codes and comparisons of synthetic spectra with
   spectra observed on Earth and from Venus. }},

Journal = MP,
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {2407-2418},
Abstract = {{Jet-cooled spectra of (NH3)-N-14 and (NH3)-N-15 in natural abundance
   were recorded using cavity ring-down (CRDS, 6584-6670 cm(-1)) and cavity
   enhanced absorption (CEAS, 6530-6700 cm(-1)) spectroscopy. Line
   broadening effects in the CRDS spectrum allowed lines with J `'-values
   between 0 and 3 to be identified. Intensity ratios in (NH3)-N-14 between
   the jet-cooled CRDS and literature room-temperature data from Sung et
   al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113 (2012), 1066) further
   assisted the line assignments. Ground state combination differences were
   extensively used to support the assignments, providing reliable values
   for J, K and inversion symmetry of the ground state vibrational levels.
   CEAS data helped in this respect for the lowest J lines, some of which
   are saturated in the CRDS spectrum. Further information on a/s doublets
   arose from the observed spectral structures. Thirty-two transitions of
   (NH3)-N-14 were assigned in this way and a limited but significant
   number (19) of changes in the assignments results, compared to Sung et
   al. or to Cacciani et al. (J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer, 113
   (2012), 1084). Sixteen known and 25 new low-J transitions were
   identified for (NH3)-N-15 in the CRDS spectrum but the much scarcer
   literature information did not allow for any more refined assignment.
   The present line position measurements improve on literature values
   published for (NH3)-N-15 and on some line positions for (NH3)-N-14.}},

   temperature in the cell is provided by a thermocouple and
