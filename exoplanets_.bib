  abstract = {We present an analysis of seven primary transit observations of the
	hot Neptune GJ436b at 3.6, 4.5, and 8 mu m obtained with the Infrared
	Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. After correcting for
	systematic effects, we fitted the light curves using the Markov Chain
	Monte Carlo technique. Combining these new data with the EPOXI, Hubble
	Space Telescope, and ground-based V, I, H, and K-s published observations,
	the range 0.5-10 mu m can be covered. Due to the low level of activity
	of GJ436, the effect of starspots on the combination of transits
	at different epochs is negligible at the accuracy of the data set.
	Representative climate models were calculated by using a three-dimensional,
	pseudospectral general circulation model with idealized thermal forcing.
	Simulated transit spectra of GJ436b were generated using line-by-line
	radiative transfer models including the opacities of the molecular
	species expected to be present in such a planetary atmosphere. A
	new, ab-initio-calculated, line list for hot ammonia has been used
	for the first time. The photometric data observed at multiple wavelengths
	can be interpreted with methane being the dominant absorption after
	molecular hydrogen, possibly with minor contributions from ammonia,
	water, and other molecules. No clear evidence of carbon monoxide
	and carbon dioxide is found from transit photometry. We discuss this
	result in the light of a recent paper where photochemical disequilibrium
	is hypothesized to interpret secondary transit photometric data.
	We show that the emission photometric data are not incompatible with
	the presence of abundant methane, but further spectroscopic data
	are desirable to confirm this scenario.},

  abstract = {The science of extra-solar planets is one of the most rapidly changing
	areas of astrophysics and since 1995 the number of planets known
	has increased by almost two orders of magnitude. A combination of
	ground-based surveys and dedicated space missions has resulted in
	560-plus planets being detected, and over 1200 that await confirmation.
	NASA's Kepler mission has opened up the possibility of discovering
	Earth-like planets in the habitable zone around some of the 100,000
	stars it is surveying during its 3 to 4-year lifetime. The new ESA's
	Gain mission is expected to discover thousands of new planets around
	stars within 200 parsecs of the Sun. The key challenge now is moving
	on from discovery, important though that remains, to characterisation:
	what are these planets actually like, and why are they as they are?
	In the past ten years, we have learned how to obtain the first spectra
	of exoplanets using transit transmission and emission spectroscopy.
	With the high stability of Spitzer, Hubble, and large ground-based
	telescopes the spectra of bright close-in massive planets can be
	obtained and species like water vapour, methane, carbon monoxide
	and dioxide have been detected. With transit science came the first
	tangible remote sensing of these planetary bodies and so one can
	start to extrapolate from what has been learnt from Solar System
	probes to what one might plan to learn about their faraway siblings.
	As we learn more about the atmospheres, surfaces and near-surfaces
	of these remote bodies, we will begin to build up a clearer picture
	of their construction, history and suitability for life. The Exoplanet
	Characterisation Observatory, EChO, will be the first dedicated mission
	to investigate the physics and chemistry of Exoplanetary Atmospheres.
	By characterising spectroscopically more bodies in different environments
	we will take detailed planetology out of the Solar System and into
	the Galaxy as a whole. EChO has now been selected by the European
	Space Agency to be assessed as one of four M3 mission candidates.},

  abstract = {A dedicated mission to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres represents
	a major milestone in our quest to understand our place in the universe
	by placing our Solar System in context and by addressing the suitability
	of planets for the presence of life. EChO-the Exoplanet Characterisation
	Observatory-is a mission concept specifically geared for this purpose.
	EChO will provide simultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations
	on a stable platform that will allow very long exposures. The use
	of passive cooling, few moving parts and well established technology
	gives a low-risk and potentially long-lived mission. EChO will build
	on observations by Hubble, Spitzer and ground-based telescopes, which
	discovered the first molecules and atoms in exoplanetary atmospheres.
	However, EChO's configuration and specifications are designed to
	study a number of systems in a consistent manner that will eliminate
	the ambiguities affecting prior observations. EChO will simultaneously
	observe a broad enough spectral region-from the visible to the mid-infrared-to
	constrain from one single spectrum the temperature structure of the
	atmosphere, the abundances of the major carbon and oxygen bearing
	species, the expected photochemically-produced species and magnetospheric
	signatures. The spectral range and resolution are tailored to separate
	bands belonging to up to 30 molecules and retrieve the composition
	and temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. The target list
	for EChO includes planets ranging from Jupiter-sized with equilibrium
	temperatures T (eq) up to 2,000 K, to those of a few Earth masses,
	with T (eq) \textbackslash{}u223c 300 K. The list will include planets
	with no Solar System analog, such as the recently discovered planets
	GJ1214b, whose density lies between that of terrestrial and gaseous
	planets, or the rocky-iron planet 55 Cnc e, with day-side temperature
	close to 3,000 K. As the number of detected exoplanets is growing
	rapidly each year, and the mass and radius of those detected steadily
	decreases, the target list will be constantly adjusted to include
	the most interesting systems. We have baselined a dispersive spectrograph
	design covering continuously the 0.4-16 mu m spectral range in 6
	channels (1 in the visible, 5 in the InfraRed), which allows the
	spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,
	depending on the target brightness. The instrument will be mounted
	behind a 1.5 m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 K, with the
	instrument structure and optics passively cooled to \textbackslash{}u223c45
	K. EChO will be placed in a grand halo orbit around L2. This orbit,
	in combination with an optimised thermal shield design, provides
	a highly stable thermal environment and a high degree of visibility
	of the sky to observe repeatedly several tens of targets over the
	year. Both the baseline and alternative designs have been evaluated
	and no critical items with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) less
	than 4-5 have been identified. We have also undertaken a first-order
	cost and development plan analysis and find that EChO is easily compatible
	with the ESA M-class mission framework.},
