Title = {{Using an internal coordinate Gaussian basis and a space-fixed Cartesian
   coordinate kinetic energy operator to compute a vibrational spectrum
   with rectangular collocation}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{145}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that it is possible to use basis functions that depend on
   curvilinear internal coordinates to compute vibrational energy levels
   without deriving a kinetic energy operator (KEO) and without numerically
   computing coefficients of a KEO. This is done by using a space-fixed KEO
   and computing KEO matrix elements numerically. Whenever one has an
   excellent basis, more accurate solutions to the Schrodinger equation can
   be obtained by computing the KEO, potential, and overlap matrix elements
   numerically. Using a Gaussian basis and bond coordinates, we compute
   vibrational energy levels of formaldehyde. We show, for the first time,
   that it is possible with a Gaussian basis to solve a six-dimensional
   vibrational Schrodinger equation. For the zero-point energy (ZPE) and
   the lowest 50 vibrational transitions of H2CO, we obtain a mean absolute
   error of less than 1 cm(-1); with 200 000 collocation points and 40 000
   basis functions, most errors are less than 0.4 cm(-1). }},

Abstract = {{Quartic force fields (QFFs) have been shown to be one of the most
   effective ways to efficiently compute vibrational frequencies for small
   molecules. In this letter we discuss how the simple-internal or
   bond-length bond-angle (BLBA) coordinates can be transformed into
   Morse-cosine (-sine) coordinates which produce potential energy surfaces
   from QFFs that possess proper limiting behavior and can describe the
   vibrational (or rovibrational) energy levels of an arbitrary molecular
   system to 5 cm(-1) or better compared to experiment. We investigate
   parameter scaling in the Morse coordinate, symmetry considerations, and
   examples of transformed QFFs making use of the MULTIMODE, TROVE, and
   VTET variational vibrational methods. }},

Journal = MP,

Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{Local normal modes have been used recently in vibrational
   self-consistent field/virtual state configuration interaction
   calculations of vibrational energies and infrared spectra of water
   clusters ranging from the water hexamer to bulk water. This approach is
   termed the local monomer model, and here we show that vibrational
   second-order perturbation theory (VPT2) can be used with this model. The
   approach is thus complementary to standard VPT2 theory, but has near
   linear scaling with the number of monomers, in contrast to standard VPT2
   theory. The local VPT2 approach is described and then illustrated and
   tested for the water dimer H2O2 using the ab initio
   Wang-Huang-Braams-Bowman (WHBB) potential energy surface, mainly for the
   six intramolecular modes.}},

r to simplify the computation of these additional terms several approximations a
re presented and discussed leading to reflection-reduced CAPs (RCAPs). As an alt
ernative approach a transformative CAP (TCAP) method is introduced that uses a m
odified kinetic energy operator. By the TCAP method reflections can be avoided even more efficiently. The different effects that are responsible for the reflections are discussed in detail. Similarities and differences to the method of complex scaling are discussed. The feasibility and superiority of the methods to usual CAP methods is demonstrated by calculations of resonance energies for a model potential.}

	(MCTDH) method, which is an algorithm for propagating wavepackets.
	The formal derivation, numerical implementation, and performance
	of the method are detailed. As demonstrated by example applications,
	MCTDH may perform very efficiently, especially when there are many
	(typically four to twelve, say) degrees of freedom. The largest system
	treated with MCTDH to date is the pyrazine molecule, where all 24
	(!) vibrational modes were accounted for. The particular representation
	of the MCTDH wavefunction requires special techniques for generating
	an initial wavepacket and for analysing the propagated wavefunction.
	These techniques are discussed. The full efficiency of the MCTDH
	method is only realised if the Hamiltonian can be written as a sum
	of products of one-dimensional operators. The kinetic energy operator
	and many model potential functions already have this required structure.
	For other potential functions, we describe an efficient algorithm
	for determining optimal fits of product form. An alternative to the
	product representation, the correlation discrete variable representation
	(CDVR) method, is also briefly discussed. },

	SCATTERING VIA THE S-MATRIX KOHN METHOD},
  journal = JCP,
  year = {1992},
  volume = {96},
  pages = {1982-1991},
  abstract = {A novel discrete variable representation (DVR) is introduced for use
	as the L2 basis of the S-matrix version of the Kohn variational method
	{[}Zhang, Chu, and Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 88, 6233 (1988)] for quantum
	reactive scattering. (It can also be readily used for quantum eigenvalue
	problems). The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely
	simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal,
	as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ``universal,{''} i.e., independent
	of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions;
	it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different
	basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid
	points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential
	energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H + H2 -->
	H2 + H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities
	is achieved with only about 15\% more DVR grid points than the number
	of conventional basis functions used in previous S-matrix Kohn calculations.
	Test calculations for the collinear Cl + HCl --> ClH + Cl reaction
	shows that the unusual dynamical features of heavy + light-heavy
	reactions are also well described by this approach. Since DVR approaches

  abstract = {Developments during the last two decades in nuclear motion theory
	made it possible to obtain variational solutions to the time-independent,
	nuclear-motion Schrodinger equation of polyatomic systems as ``exact''
	as the potential energy surface (PES) is. Nuclear motion theory thus
	reached a level whereby this branch of quantum chemistry started
	to catch up with the well developed and widely applied other branch,
	electronic structure theory. It seems to be fair to declare that
	we are now in the fourth age of quantum chemistry, where the first
	three ages are principally defined by developments in electronic
	structure techniques (G. Richards, Nature, 1979, 278, 507). In the
	fourth age we are able to incorporate into our quantum chemical treatment
	the motion of nuclei in an exact fashion and, for example, go beyond
	equilibrium molecular properties and compute accurate, temperature-dependent,
	effective properties, thus closing the gap between measurements and
	electronic structure computations. In this Perspective three fundamental
	algorithms for the variational solution of the time-independent nuclear-motion
	Schrodinger equation employing exact kinetic energy operators are
	presented: one based on tailor-made Hamiltonians, one on the Eckart-Watson
	Hamiltonian, and one on a general internal-coordinate Hamiltonian.
	It is argued that the most useful and most widely applicable procedure
	is the third one, based on a Hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy
	operator written in terms of internal coordinates and an arbitrary
	embedding of the body-fixed frame of the molecule. This Hamiltonian
	makes it feasible to treat the nuclear motions of arbitrary quantum
	systems, irrespective of whether they exhibit a single well-defined
	minimum or not, and of arbitrary reduced-dimensional models. As a
	result, molecular spectroscopy, an important field for the application
	of nuclear motion theory, has almost black-box-type tools at its
	disposal. Variational nuclear motion computations, based on an exact
	kinetic energy operator and an arbitrary PES, can now be performed
	for about 9 active vibrational degrees of freedom relatively straightforwardly.
	Simulations of high-resolution spectra allow the understanding of
	complete rotational-vibrational spectra up to and beyond the first
	dissociation limits. Variational results obtained for H2O, H-3(+),
	NH3, CH4, and H2CCO are used to demonstrate the power of the variational
	techniques for the description of vibrational and rotational excitations.
	Some qualitative features of the results are also discussed.},

	the first-order properties by the differentiation of the perturbed
	\{CI\} energy is more appropriate than using the Hellmann---Feynman
	theorem. The energy derivative definition of the first-order properties
	corrects the Hellmann---Feynman results for an incomplete variational
	treatment of the perturbation effects. The additional term which

	moments of FH, H2O, \{NH3\} and \{CO\} using the \{CI\} functions
	involving single and double substitutions with respect to the \{HF\}

	contribution to the dipole moment of the \{CO\} molecule. This indicates
	that it may be fortuitous that some data previously calculated from
	\{CI\} functions by using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem are close

	is analysed in terms of the diagrammatic expansion of the correlation

  abstract = {{The correlated k-distribution method for radiative transfer in nonhomogeneous
	atmospheres is discussed in terms of the physical and mathematical
	conditions under which this method is valid. Two correlated conditions
	are necessary and sufficient for the exact transformation of the
	wavenumber integration to an integration over the cumulative probability
	(g), a monotonically increasing and smooth function in the absorption
	coefficient space. These conditions involve the use of a reference
	condition to define the absorption coefficient and an assumption
	concerning the ordering of the absorption coefficient. The correlated
	conditions are exact in the context of a single line, periodic lines,
	and the strong- and weak-line limits. In realistic atmospheres, these
	assumptions am best for adjacent levels but produce increasing blurring
	or deviations for distant levels. We investigate the blurring of
	the correlated assumptions on the computations of fluxes and heating
	rates based on ``exact{''} line-by-line results, using a variety
	of atmospheric profiles and spectral intervals containing principal
	absorbing gases. In the thermal infrared, errors in fluxes am less
	than 0.2\% for H2O, CO2, CH4, and N2O, and approximately 2\% for
	O3. Errors in heating rates are less than 0.01 K day-1 for these
	gases below approximately 30 km. Larger errors of approximately 0.1
	K day-1 can occur at some levels above this height. For H2O lines
	in the solar region, errors in fluxes and heating rates are within
	0.05\% and 0.01 K day-1, respectively. Based on numerical experimentation,
	we find that the number of g values ranging from 1 (for weak bands)
	to approximately 10 (for strong bands) are usually sufficient to
	achieve acceptable accuracy for flux and heating rate calculations.
	The correlated k-distribution method differs fundamentally from the
	traditional approach that employs scaling approximations and band
	models to separate height and wavenumber integrations for transmittance
	calculations. The equivalent k values for various gases computed
	from this approach can be directly incorporated in the multiple-scattering
	program involving cloud and aerosol particles.}},

	The model assumes that bonding in the nickel halides has the approximate

	on the Ni+ moiety and a closed shell configuration on the X- moiety.
	From a crystal-field point of view, interactions of the positive

	by three terms in a traditional expansion in values comparable with

	oxidizing through reducing, which makes the code suitable for applications
	for the wide range of anticipated terrestrial exoplanet compositions.
	The one-dimensional chemical transport model treats up to 800 chemical
	reactions, photochemical processes, dry and wet deposition, surface
	emission, and thermal escape of O, H, C, N, and S bearing species,
	as well as formation and deposition of elemental sulfur and sulfuric

	composition of current Earth and Mars and find agreement with observations
	of major trace gases in Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. We simulate
	several plausible atmospheric scenarios of terrestrial exoplanets
	and choose three benchmark cases for atmospheres from reducing to
	oxidizing. The most interesting finding is that atomic hydrogen is
	always a more abundant reactive radical than the hydroxyl radical
	in anoxic atmospheres. Whether atomic hydrogen is the most important
	removal path for a molecule of interest also depends on the relevant
	reaction rates. We also find that volcanic carbon compounds (i.e.,
	CH 4 and CO 2 ) are chemically long-lived and tend to be well mixed
	in both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres, and their dry deposition
	velocities to the surface control the atmospheric oxidation states.
	Furthermore, we revisit whether photochemically produced oxygen can
	cause false positives for detecting oxygenic photosynthesis, and
	find that in 1 bar CO 2 -rich atmospheres oxygen and ozone may build
	up to levels that have conventionally been accepted as signatures
	of life, if there is no surface emission of reducing gases. The atmospheric
	scenarios presented in this paper can serve as the benchmark atmospheres
	for quickly assessing the lifetime of trace gases in reducing, weakly
	oxidizing, and highly oxidizing atmospheres on terrestrial exoplanets
	for the exploration of possible biosignature gases.}

  abstract = {For a triatomic molecule, we develop the rovibronic Hamiltonian, basis

	the energy levels and wavefunctions in the situation that two potential
	energy surfaces touch at the linear configuration, The calculation
	of the rovibronic energy levels is complicated by the effect of the
	electronic angular momentum (the Renner effect), and while dealing
	with this problem we include spin-orbit coupling. We have written
	a computer program to implement the procedure, We base our approach
	on the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program for an isolated electronic
	state {[}P. Jensen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 128, 478-501 (1988); J. Chem.

	procedure that will, in the future, allow us to make fittings to

  abstract = {The conformation and dynamical behavior of molecular systems is very
	often advantageously described in terms of physically well-adapted
	curvilinear coordinates. It is rather easy to show that the numerous
	analytical expressions of the kinetic energy operator of a molecular
	system described in terms of n curvilinear coordinates can all be
	transformed into the following more usable expression: (T) over cap=Sigma(ij)f(2)(ij)(q)partial
	derivative(2)/partial derivativeq(i)partial derivativeq(j)+Sigma(i)f(1)(i)(q)partial
	derivative/partial derivativeq(i)+nu(q), where f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q),
	and nu(q) are functions of the curvilinear coordinates q=(...,q(i),...).
	If the advantages of curvilinear coordinates are unquestionable,
	they do have a major drawback: the sometimes awful complexity of
	the analytical expression of the kinetic operator (T) over cap for
	molecular systems with more than five atoms. Therefore, we develop
	an algorithm for computing (T) over cap for a given value of the
	n curvilinear coordinates q. The calculation of the functions f(2)(ij)(q),
	f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) only requires the knowledge of the Cartesian
	coordinates and their derivatives in terms of the n curvilinear coordinates.
	This coordinate transformation (curvilinear-->Cartesian) is very
	easy to perform and is widely used in quantum chemistry codes resorting
	to a Z-matrix to define the curvilinear coordinates. Thus, the functions
	f(2)(ij)(q), f(1)(i)(q), and nu(q) can be evaluated numerically and
	exactly for a given value of q, which makes it possible to propagate
	wavepackets or to simulate the spectra of rather complex systems
	(constrained Hamiltonian). The accuracy of this numerical procedure
	is tested by comparing two calculations of the bending spectrum of
	HCN: the first one, performed by using the present numerical kinetic
	operator procedure, the second one, obtained in previous studies,
	by using an analytical kinetic operator. Finally, the ab initio computation
	of the internal rotation spectrum and wave functions of 2-methylpropanal
	by means of dimensionality reduction, is given as an original application.},

  abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the fundamental theory describing
	the interaction of electrons and photons. Its characteristic feature
	is that both radiation and matter are treated quantum mechanically.
	For almost all atomic and molecular systems, which contain bound
	electrons moving at velocities considerably less than that of light,
	a non-relativistic formulation of QED is appropriate. Termed molecular
	QED, its Hamiltonian operator can be constructed by starting from
	the classical Lagrangian function for the interaction of a charged
	particle with a radiation field on applying the variational calculus
	and carrying out the canonical quantization procedure. It is shown
	how the minimal-coupling Lagrangian can be transformed to the chemically
	advantageous multipolar Hamiltonian in which matter couples to radiation
	directly through molecular multipole moments, with the ensuing interaction
	strictly causal. Applications include evaluation of transition rates
	for one- and two-photon absorption, spontaneous and stimulated emission,
	and signal intensities for second- and third-harmonic generation.
	Fundamental intermolecular interactions examined include resonance
	energy transfer, the van der Waals dispersion potential, and the
	change in energy shift of the pair induced by intense external radiation.
	The non-relativistic contribution to the Lamb shift is also extracted.
	It is shown how a number of the above mentioned processes may be
	attributed to fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field, which
	possesses zero-point energy, a signature QED effect that has widespread

  abstract = {A grid-based method designed to refine adiabatic potential energy
	surfaces (PES) of molecules via minimizing a suitable objective function
	is described. The objective function contains deviations from the
	reference (experimental) (ro)-vibrational energy levels and is based
	on PES correction values determined at the grid points within a discrete-variable-representation
	nuclear-motion algorithm and first-order perturbation theory (PT).
	The proposed PES refinement technique is tested on the ground electronic
	state of the MgH molecule. The large number of numerical test results
	obtained suggest the following: (1) first-order PT is able to yield
	accurate correction values at the grid points representing the PES,
	and for practical cases there seems to be no need to go to higher
	orders of PT; (2) with the number of grid points greatly exceeding
	the number of experimental energy levels included in the refinement
	procedure, terms additional to the ``obs-calc{''} term, including
	numerical first and second derivatives of the correction surface,
	are necessary in the objective function to arrive at a physically
	meaningful, ``smooth{''} correction surface; (3) for a given J rotational
	quantum number, the corrected PES is able to reproduce experimental
	(ro)vibrational energies to within tenths of cm(-1) if they are included
	in the refinement or interpolated between states that are involved
	in the optimization, whereas extrapolated states tend to have somewhat
	larger remaining discrepancies; (4) the PES refined only for the
	j = 0 states introduces a minor systematic error for J> 0 states,
	with discrepancies growing with j; (5) when the number of experimental
	energies included in the refinement greatly exceeds the number of
	grid points upon which the PES is optimized, the systematic error
	of treating states with different J rotational quantum numbers can
	be reduced and an impressive average accuracy can be achieved for
	all rovibrational states; and (6) in the case of quasibound (also
	known as resonance) rovibrational states, energies can be computed
	to accuracies similar to those of the bound states and excellent
	lifetimes (widths) can also be determined. Changes in thermochemical
	functions upon inclusion of quasibound states during direct summation
	is discussed.},

	Rotational labeling of rovibrational states of (H2O)-O-16 proves
	to be increasingly difficult beyond about 10 000 cm(-1), close to

	For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of

	It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ
	and aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets converge much slower for third-row elements
	then they do for first- and second-row elements. Based on the results
	of these studies criteria are deduced for the accuracy of auxiliary
	basis sets used in the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation
	for electron repulsion integrals. Optimized auxiliary basis sets
	for RI-MP2 calculations fulfilling these criteria are reported for
	the sets cc-pVXZ, cc-pV(X+d)Z, aug-cc-pVXZ, and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z with
	X=D, T, and Q. For all basis sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation
	energy is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the usual

	sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole

	error. Therefore extrapolations towards the basis-set limit are possible
	within the RI approximation for both energies and properties. The
	reduction in CPU time obtained with the RI approximation increases
	rapidly with basis set size. For the cc-pVQZ basis an acceleration
	by a factor of up to 170 is observed. },

Abstract = {{We present a new procedure for computing a rovibrational spectrum of a
   polyatomic molecule and apply it to methane. The Schrodinger equation is
   solved, numerically exactly, by using a nested contracted basis.
   Rovibrational wavefunctions are computed in a vertical bar v >vertical
   bar J K M > basis, where vertical bar v > is a vibrational wavefunction
   and vertical bar JKM > is a symmetric top wavefunction. In turn, the
   vertical bar v > are obtained by solving a vibrational Schrodinger
   equation with basis functions that are products of contracted bend and
   stretch functions. At all stages of the calculation we exploit parity
   symmetry. The calculations are done in internal coordinates that
   facilitate the treatment of large amplitude motion. An Eckart
   molecule-fixed frame is used by numerically computing coefficients of
   the kinetic energy operator. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated
   by calculating a large number of converged J = 10 methane rovibrational
   levels in the Tetradecad polyad. No previous calculation of
   rovibrational levels of methane includes as many levels as we report in

   is the fact that one can prune the basis: many DVR functions can be

   reduces the cost of the calculation. We have implemented a mapping

Abstract = {{A simple variational procedure, termed DOPI for discrete variable
   representation-Hamiltonian in orthogonal coordinates-direct product
   basis-iterative diagonalization, is described and applied to compute
   low-lying vibrational band origins (VBOs) of the triatomic systems H2O,
   CO2, and N2O, employing published empirical and theoretical sextic force
   fields. While in these cases no difficulties arise when quartic
   potentials are used, the limited range of applicability of 6th-order
   potentials presents difficulties for the variational determination of
   VBOs, in particular for the higher-lying bending states. For H2O,
   transformation of quadratic and quartic force fields from simple bond
   stretching to Simons-Parr-Finian (SPF) coordinates results in computed
   VBOs deviating less from experiment. This, however, does not hold for
   the VBOs computed from the transformed sextic force fields where the two
   representations provide highly similar results. While use of empirical
   quartic and sextic force fields result in a much better reproduction of
   experimental VBOs than that of ab initio force fields, especially at
   higher (fifth- and sixth-) order the empirical force constants, obtained
   through different refinement procedures, do not correspond to the
   associated derivatives of the potential energy surface (PES). Rotational
   constants characterizing low-lying vibrational states have been
   evaluated as expectation values using inertia tensor formulas in the
   Eckart and principal axis frames. Only the Eckart axes should be used
   for these computations and they yield accurate vibrationally averaged
   rotational constants.}},

Pages = {2145-2182},
Abstract = {In this article, we review state-of-the-art methods for computing
   vibrational energies of polyatomic molecules using quantum mechanical,
   variationally-based approaches. We illustrate the power of those methods
   by presenting applications to molecules with more than four atoms. This
   demonstrates the great progress that has been made in this field in the
   last decade in dealing with the exponential scaling with the number of
   vibrational degrees of freedom. In this review we present three methods
   that effectively obviate this bottleneck. The first important idea is
   the n-mode representation of the Hamiltonian and notably the potential.
   The potential (and other functions) is represented as a sum of terms
   that depend on a subset of the coordinates. This makes it possible to
   compute matrix elements, form a Hamiltonian matrix, and compute its
   eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Another approach takes advantage of this
   multimode representation and represents the terms as a sum of products.
   It then exploits the powerful multiconfiguration Hartree time-dependent
   method to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and extract the
   eigenvalue spectrum. The third approach we present uses contracted basis
   functions in conjunction with a Lanczos eigensolver. Matrix vector
   products are done without transforming to a direct-product grid. The
   usefulness of these methods is demonstrated for several example
   molecules, e.g. methane, methanol and the Zundel cation.},

abstract = {Approaches related to graph theory are investigated which allow a better understanding and yield routes for systematic enlargement and improvement of experimental spectroscopic line lists of molecules. The proposed protocols are based on the fact that quantum mechanics builds, in a simple and natural way, large-scale, weighted, undirected graphs, whereby the vertices are discrete energy levels, the edges are transitions, and the weights are transition intensities. A small part of molecular quantum mechanical graphs can be probed experimentally via high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, while the complete graph encompassing the full line list information for a given molecule can be obtained through sophisticated variational nuclear motion computations. Both approaches yield what one may call spectroscopic networks (SNs). It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule that both the measured and the computed one-photon absorption SNs have a scale-free behavior with all of the usual consequences, including appearance of hubs, robustness, error tolerance, and the small-world property. For the complete computed "deterministic" network the scale-free property holds if a realistic intensity cut-off is employed during its build-up, thus introducing "stochasticity". The graph-theoretical view of molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of the information systems containing high-resolution spectroscopic data. }

While first-principles SNs are "deterministic" by definition, if a realistic transition intensity cut-off is employed during the construction of these SNs, a certain randomness ("stochasticity") is introduced. Experiments naturally build random graphs. It is shown on the example of the HD16O isotopologue of the water molecule how intensities, in the present case one-photon absorption intensities, determine the structure as well as the degree distribution and edge density of SNs. The degree distribution of realistic computed SNs can be described as scale free, with the usual and well known consequences. Experimental SNs, based on measured and assigned transitions, also turn out to be scale free. The graph-theoretical view of high-resolution molecular spectra offers several new ideas for improving the accuracy and robustness of information systems containing spectroscopic data. For example, it is shown that most all rotational–vibrational energy levels are involved in at least a few relatively strong transitions suggesting that an almost complete coverage of experimental quality energy levels can be deduced from measurements. }

The experimental intensities available for low- Δ n values are well reproduced by a variety of models but the models can greatly diverge in predicting the intensities of unobserved high-overtone transitions, the divergence rapidly increasing with the overtone number. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the dipole-moment function (DMF) representation on the high-overtone intensity simulation of the \{CO\} molecule. We tested various \{DMF\} forms including pointwise representation combined with cubic-spline interpolation, power and trigonometric expansions, and Padé approximants. Numerical calculations were performed with the highly accurate empirical potential-energy function (PEF) of Coxon and Hajigeorgiou (2004) using quadruple-precision arithmetic. Most calculated intensities fall off in the entire range of transitions according to the Normal Intensity Distribution Law (NIDL) (Medvedev, 2012). The slope of the \{NIDL\} trend line varies little between different analytical \{DMFs\} for a given \{PEF\} since the slope is basically associated with the PEF. Based on the NIDL, the limits within which the simulated intensities fall off up to the dissociation limit can be established. We claim that \{DMFs\} represented by analytical functions yield best results for all transitions. The pointwise functions (interpolated, in particular, by the conventional cubic splines) result in an unphysical flattening of the intensities at high- Δ n transitions, Δ n &gt; 7 for CO.}}

Abstract = {The possibilities for the approximate treatment of higher excitations

the special contractions appearing in the equations specific to those approximate

to higher excitations can be efficiently implemented with the aid of our algorithm
and that the coding effort is mostly reduced to the generation of the corresponding
formulas. The performance of the proposed and implemented methods for total energies
is assessed with special regard to quadruple and pentuple excitations. The applicability
of our approach is illustrated by benchmark calculations for the butadiene molecule.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables us to consider the effect
of quadruple excitations for molecular systems consisting of up to 10–12 atoms.},

    abstract = { In this perspective, I review methods for computing (ro-)vibrational energy levels and wavefunctions of molecules with more than four atoms. I identify three problems one confronts (1) reducing the size of the basis; (2) computing hundreds of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large matrix; (3) calculating matrix elements of the potential, and present ideas that mitigate them. Most modern methods use a combination of these ideas. I divide popular methods into groups based on the strategies used to deal with the three problems. }

Abstract = {A description is given of an algorithm for computing rovibrational
   energy levels for tetratomic molecules. The expressions required for
   evaluating transition intensities are also given. The variational
   principle is used to determine the energy levels, and the kinetic
   energy operator is simple and evaluated exactly. The computational
   procedure is split up into the determination of one-dimensional radial
   basis functions, the computation of a contracted rotational-bending
   basis, followed by a final variational step coupling all degrees of
   freedom. An angular basis is proposed whereby the rotational-bending
   contraction takes place in three steps. Angular matrix elements of the
   potential are evaluated by expansion in terms of a suitable basis, and
   the angular integrals are given in a factorized form which simplifies
   their evaluation. The basis functions in the final variational step
   have the full permutation symmetries of the identical particles. Sample
   results are given for HCCH and BH3.}

Abstract = {{The coupled channel method for solving the bound-state Schrodinger equation is described. The method has been widely applied to the vibrational-rotational levels of floppy molecules such as Van der Waals complexes, but is also applicable in other areas of physics. It uses a basis set expansion for all degrees of freedom except a radial coordinate, and produces a set of coupled differential equations in the radial coordinate. In modern methods of solution, the coupled equations are solved by propagating the log-derivative of the wavefunction. Eigenvalues are located by searching for zeroes of: the determinant of the ''log-derivative matching matrix'' The resulting methods are very stable, and are the method of choice for providing eigenvalues to very high precision. Some recent advances in the methods, which provide improved convergence on eigenvalues and allow the calculation of wavefunctions, are described.}},

Title = {Full-dimensional quantum calculations of ground-state tunneling
   splitting of malonaldehyde using an accurate ab initio potential energy
   surface},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {2008},
Volume = {128},
Abstract = {Quantum calculations of the ground vibrational state tunneling splitting
   of H-atom and D-atom transfer in malonaldehyde are performed on a
   full-dimensional ab initio potential energy surface (PES). The PES is a
   fit to 11 147 near basis-set-limit frozen-core CCSD(T) electronic
   energies. This surface properly describes the invariance of the
   potential with respect to all permutations of identical atoms. The
   saddle-point barrier for the H-atom transfer on the PES is 4.1 kcal/mol,
   in excellent agreement with the reported ab initio value. Model
   one-dimensional and ``exact{''} full-dimensional calculations of the
   splitting for H- and D-atom transfer are done using this PES. The
   tunneling splittings in full dimensionality are calculated using the
   unbiased ``fixed-node{''} diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method in
   Cartesian and saddle-point normal coordinates. The ground-state
   tunneling splitting is found to be 21.6 cm(-1) in Cartesian coordinates
   and 22.6 cm(-1) in normal coordinates, with an uncertainty of 2-3
   cm(-1). This splitting is also calculated based on a model which makes
   use of the exact single-well zero-point energy (ZPE) obtained with the
   MULTIMODE code and DMC ZPE and this calculation gives a tunneling
   splitting of 21-22 cm(-1). The corresponding computed splittings for the
   D-atom transfer are 3.0, 3.1, and 2-3 cm(-1). These calculated tunneling
   splittings agree with each other to within less than the standard
   uncertainties obtained with the DMC method used, which are between 2 and
   3 cm(-1), and agree well with the experimental values of 21.6 and 2.9
   cm(-1) for the H and D transfer, respectively. }}

Abstract = {The correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets (cc-pVXZ) for
   the atoms boron through neon have been extended to treat core and
   core-valence correlation effects. Basis functions were added to the
   existing cc-pVXZ sets to form correlation-consistent polarized
   core-valence sets (cc-pCVXZ) in the usual pattern: Double zeta added
   (1s1p), triple zeta added (2s2p1d), quadruple zeta added (3s3p2d1f), and
   quintuple zeta added (4s4p3d2f1g). The exponents of the core functions
   were determined by minimizing the difference between all-electron and
   valence-only correlation energies obtained from HF+1+2 calculations on
   the ground states of the atoms. With the cc-pCVXZ sets, core,
   core-valence, and valence correlation energies all converge
   exponentially toward apparent complete basis set (CBS) limits, as do the
   corresponding all-electron singles and doubles CI energies. Several test
   applications of the new sets are presented: The first two ionization
   potentials of boron, the P-3-S-5 separation in carbon, and the (X) over
   tilde(3)B(1)-(a) over tilde(1)A(1) state separation in CH2. As expected,
   correlation effects involving the core electrons of the first row atoms,
   B-Ne, are small but must be included if high accuracy is required. (C)

   The methodology, originally developed for the first row atoms {[}T. H.
   Dunning, Jr., J. Chem. Phys. 90, (1989)] is first applied to sulfur. The
   exponents for the polarization functions (dfgh) are systematically
   optimized for a correlated wave function (HF + 1 + 2). The (sp)
   correlation functions are taken from the appropriate HF primitive sets;
   it is shown that these functions differ little from the optimum
   functions. Basis sets of double zeta {[}4s3p1d], triple zeta
   {[}5s4p2d1f], and quadruple zeta {[}6s5p3d2f1g] quality are defined.
   Each of these sets is then augmented with diffuse functions to better
   describe electron affinities and other molecular properties: s and p
   functions were obtained by optimization for the anion HF energy, while
   an additional polarization function for each symmetry present in the
   standard set was optimized for the anion HF + 1 + 2 energy. The results
   for sulfur are then used to assist in determining double zeta, triple

Title = {{On the Mass of Atoms in Molecules: Beyond the Born-Oppenheimer
   Approximation}},
Journal = {Phys. Rev. X},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Describing the dynamics of nuclei in molecules requires a potential
   energy surface, which is traditionally provided by the Born-Oppenheimer
   or adiabatic approximation. However, we also need to assign masses to
   the nuclei. There, the Born-Oppenheimer picture does not account for the
   inertia of the electrons, and only bare nuclear masses are considered.
   Nowadays, experimental accuracy challenges the theoretical predictions
   of rotational and vibrational spectra and requires the participation of
   electrons in the internal motion of the molecule. More than 80 years
   after the original work of Born and Oppenheimer, this issue has still
   not been solved, in general. Here, we present a theoretical and
   numerical framework to address this problem in a general and rigorous
   way. Starting from the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear wave
   function, we include electronic effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer
   regime in a perturbative way via position-dependent corrections to the
   bare nuclear masses. This maintains an adiabaticlike point of view: The
   nuclear degrees of freedom feel the presence of the electrons via a
   single potential energy surface, whereas the inertia of electrons is
   accounted for and the total mass of the system is recovered. This
   constitutes a general framework for describing the mass acquired by slow
   degrees of freedom due to the inertia of light, bounded particles; thus,
   it is applicable not only in electron-nuclear systems but in light-heavy
   nuclei or ions as well. We illustrate this idea with a model of proton
   transfer, where the light particle is the proton and the heavy particles
   are the oxygen atoms to which the proton is bounded. Inclusion of the
   light-particle inertia allows us to gain orders of magnitude in
   accuracy. The electron-nuclear perspective is adopted, instead, to
   calculate position-dependent mass corrections using density functional
   theory for a few polyatomic molecules at their equilibrium geometry.
   These data can serve as input for the computation of high-precision
   molecular spectra.}},

	The expansion of the kinetic energy operator of an arbitrary order

	The method is applicable to molecules of arbitrary size and structure

	A new way of solving the Eckart-frame equations for curvilinear coordinates
	also based on the AD technique is presented. The resulting accuracy
	of the high-order expansion coefficients for the kinetic energy operator
	using our numerical technique is comparable to that obtained by symbolic
	differentiation, with the advantage of being faster and less demanding
	in memory. Examples for H2CO, NH3, PH3, and CH3Cl molecules demonstrate
	the advantages of the curvilinear internal coordinates and the Eckart
	molecular frame for accurate ro-vibrational calculations. Our results
	show that very high accuracy and quick convergence can be achieved
