Abstract = {{Accurate molecular partition functions are required to determine both
   thermodynamic properties for equilibrium and nonequilibrium flow field
   calculations, and energy level populations for radiative heat transfer
   in high enthalpy flows, for instance. Thermodynamic functions of
   diatomic molecules are computed in this study at high temperatures and
   for nonequilibrium media in the framework of multi-temperature models.
   Partition functions, average energies, and specific heats of N(2),
   N(2)(+), NO, O(2), CN, C(2), CO, and CO(+) are calculated up to 50,000 K
   by direct summation over energy levels using recent and accurate
   spectroscopic data and dissociation energy values. Estimates are made
   for the error introduced by neglecting the highest considered electronic
   states. For nonequilibrium media, the sensitivity of the
   multi-temperature thermodynamic functions to different schemes for
   energy partitioning is discussed. In particular, the effects of
   vibration-rotation coupling are investigated. The tabulated results are
   available upon request.}},

Title = {{Toward accurate thermochemistry of the (MgH)-Mg-24, (MgH)-Mg-25, and
   (MgH)-Mg-26 molecules at elevated temperatures: Corrections due to
   unbound states}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Abstract = {{The total partition functions Q (T) and their first two moments Q' (T)
   and Q `' (T), together with the isobaric heat capacities C-p (T), are
   computed a priori for three major MgH isotopologues on the temperature
   range of T = 100-3000 K using the recent highly accurate potential
   energy curve, spin-rotation, and non-adiabatic correction functions of
   Henderson et al. {[}J. Phys. Chem. A 117, 13373 (2013)]. Nuclear motion
   computations are carried out on the ground electronic state to determine
   the (ro) vibrational energy levels and the scattering phase shifts. The
   effect of resonance states is found to be significant above about 1000 K
   and it increases with temperature. Even very short-lived states, due to
   their relatively large number, have significant contributions to Q (T)
   at elevated temperatures. The contribution of scattering states is
   around one fourth of that of resonance states but opposite in sign.
   Uncertainty estimates are given for the possible error sources,
   suggesting that all computed thermochemical properties have an accuracy
   better than 0.005\% up to 1200 K. Between 1200 and 2500 K, the
   uncertainties can rise to around 0.1\%, while between 2500 K and 3000 K,
   a further increase to 0.5\% might be observed for Q `' (T) and Cp (T),
   principally due to the neglect of excited electronic states. The
   accurate thermochemical data determined are presented in the
   supplementary material for the three isotopologues of (MgH)-Mg-24,
   (MgH)-Mg-25, and (MgH)-Mg-26 at 1 K increments. These data, which differ
   significantly from older standard data, should prove useful for
   astronomical models incorporating thermodynamic properties of these
   species.}},
