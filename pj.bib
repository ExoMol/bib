Title = {{An ab initio study of SbH2 and BiH2: The Renner effect, spin-orbit
   coupling, local mode vibrations and rovibronic energy level clustering
   in SbH2}},
Journal = JMS,

Pages = {130-141},
Abstract = {{We present the results of ab initio calculations for the lower
   electronic states of the Group 15 (pnictogen) dihydrides, SbH2 and BiH2.
   For each of these molecules the two lowest electronic states become
   degenerate at linearity and are therefore subject to the Renner effect.
   Spin-orbit coupling is also strong in these two heavy-element containing
   molecules. For the lowest two electronic states of SbH2, we construct
   the three dimensional potential energy surfaces and corresponding dipole
   moment and transition moment surfaces by multi-reference configuration
   interaction techniques. Including both the Renner effect and spin-orbit
   coupling, we calculate term values and simulate the rovibrational and
   rovibronic spectra of SbH2. Excellent agreement is obtained with the
   results of matrix isolation infrared spectroscopic studies and with gas
   phase electronic spectroscopic studies in absorption. For the heavier
   dihydride BiH2 we calculate bending potential curves and the spin-orbit
   coupling constant for comparison. For SbH2 we further study the local
   mode vibrational behavior and the formation of rovibronic energy level
   clusters in high angular momentum states.,

Title = {{Experimental and Theoretical Characterization of the 2 $^2$A`-- 1 $^2$A`
   Transition of BeOH/D}},
Journal = JPCA,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {13654-13663},
Abstract = {{The hydroxides of Ca, Sr, and Ba are known to be linear molecules, while
   MgOH is quasilinear. High-level ab initio calculations for BeOH predict
   a bent equilibrium structure with a bond angle of 140.9 degrees,
   indicating a significant contribution of covalency to the bonding.
   However, experimental confirmation of the bent structure is lacking. In
   the present study, we have used laser excitation techniques to observe
   the 2(2)A `-1(2)A ` transition of BeOH/D in the energy range of
   30300-32800 cm(-1). Rotationally resolved spectra were obtained, with
   sufficient resolution to reveal spin splittings for the electronically
   excited state. Two-color photoionization was used to determine an
   ionization energy of 66425(10) cm(-1). Ab initio calculations were used
   to guide the analysis of the spectroscopic data. Multireference
   configuration interaction calculations were used to construct potential
   energy surfaces for the 1(2)A `, 2(2)A `, and 1(2)A `' states. The
   rovibronic eigenstates supported by these surfaces, were determined
   using the Morse oscillator rigid bender internal dynamics Hamiltonian.
   The theoretical results were in sufficiently good agreement with the
   experimental data to permit unambiguous assignment. It was confirmed
   that the equilibrium geometry of the ground state is bent and that the
   barrier to linearity lies below the zero-point energies for both BeOH
   and BeOD.}},

   MgNC/MgCN: Higher excited rovibrational states}},

Abstract = {{The authors report here the implementation of a newly developed, highly
   efficient matrix diagonalization routine in the DR program {[}T. E.
   Odaka et al., J. Mol. Struct. 795, 14 (2006)]. The DR program solves the
   rovibronic Schrodinger equation for a triatomic molecule with a double
   Renner effect, i.e., with two accessible linear arrangements of the
   nuclei at which the electronic energy is doubly degenerate. With the new
   routines, the authors can extend the DR calculations of rovibronic
   energies for A(2)II MgNC/MgCN by considering a much larger set of
   rovibronic states, in particular, states at higher J values, than the
   authors were able to access previously.}},

Title = {{Ab initio molecular orbital study of ground and low-lying electronic
   states of NiCN}},
Journal = CP,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{346}},
Pages = {13-22},
Abstract = {{The electronic ground state and some low-lying excited states of NiCN
   have been studied by ab initio multi-reference single and double
   excitation configuration interaction calculations (MR-SDCI) with
   Davidson's correction Q and Cowan-Griffin's relativistic corrections
   Eel. The electronic ground state of NiCN is (2)Delta(i) and the
   equilibrium geometry is linear with bond lengths of r(e)(Ni-C) = 1.8141
   angstrom and r(e)(C-N) = 1.1665 angstrom. According to multi-reference
   averaged quadratic coupled-cluster theory (MR-AQCC) with E-rel, the
   first excited state is (2)Sigma(+), separated from the ground state by
   446 cm(-1), the second and third excited states are (2)Pi(i) (at 1594
   cm(-1)) and (4)Delta(i) (at 8930 cm(-1)), respectively, and other
   quartet states follow. The relative stabilities and the molecular
   properties of the low- and high-spin states having the same electronic
   total angular momentum are shown to be determined by dynamical electron
   correlation effects. A spin-orbit interaction scheme for the lowest
   doublet manifold is proposed. The predicted term values (in cm(-1)) are

Journal =SCAA, 
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {763-794},
Abstract = {{We have developed a computational procedure, based on the variational
   method, for the calculation of the rovibronic energies of a triatomic
   molecule in an electronic state that become degenerate at the linear
   nuclear configuration. In such an electronic state the coupling caused
   by the electronic orbital angular momentum is very significant and it is
   called the Renner effect. We include it, and the effect of spin-orbit
   coupling, in our program. We have developed the procedure to the point
   where spectral line intensities can be calculated so that absorption and
   emission spectra can be simulated. In order to gain insight into the
   nature of the eigenfunctions, we have introduced and calculated the
   overall bending probability density function f(rho) of the states. By
   projecting the eigenfunctions onto the Born-Oppenheimer basis, we have
   determined the probability density functions f(+)(rho) and f(-)(rho)
   associated with the individual Born-Oppenheimer states Phi(elec)((-))
   and Phi(elec)((+)). At a given temperature the Boltzmann averaged value
   of the f(p) over all the eigenstates gives the bending probability
   distribution function F(rho), and this can be related to the result of a
   Coulomb Explosion Imaging (CEI) experiment. We review our work and apply
   it to the molecules CH2+, MgNC and NH2, all of which are of
   astrophysical interest.}},

Journal = JMS,

Pages = {31-57},
Abstract = {{For a triatomic molecule, we develop the rovibronic Hamiltonian, basis
   functions, and matrix elements necessary to allow us to determine the
   energy levels and wavefunctions in the situation that two potential
   energy surfaces touch at the linear configuration, The calculation of
   the rovibronic energy levels is complicated by the effect of the
   electronic angular momentum (the Renner effect), and while dealing with
   this problem we include spin-orbit coupling. We have written a computer
   program to implement the procedure, We base our approach on the MORBID
   Hamiltonian and computer program for an isolated electronic state {[}P.

   Physics'' (S. Wilson and G. H. F. Diercksen, Eds.), Plenum Press, New
   York, 1992]. The approach leads to a very efficient computational
   procedure that will, in the future, allow us to make fittings to data in
   order to determine potential energy surfaces and spin-orbit coupling
   functions. In this paper we test the computer program implementing the
   new procedure by calculating rovibronic energies for the (\$) over tilde

   a(1)A(1) state by P. Jensen and P. R. Bunker {[}J. Chem. Phys. 89,

   results determined from the fitted (\$) over tilde a-state potential
   throws significant doubt on previous estimations of the (\$) over tilde

   Hartland, D. Qin, and H.-L. Dal, J. Chem. Phys. 98, 2469-2472 (1993) and

   diagrams showing how the rovibronic energies change as the potential
   energy surfaces are adjusted from linear to bent. }},
