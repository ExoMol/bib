Abstract = {An unresolved discrepancy between high-accuracy potential energy curves
   for the argon dimer (), which support different numbers of bound
   vibrational states and profoundly different scattering lengths for , is
   probed by morphing these curves to available spectral data within the
   reduced potential energy curve approach. Although the morphed curves
   studied closely coincide, they still afford different numbers of bound
   vibrational states and produce disparate scattering lengths. Resolving
   these discrepancies therefore remains a challenge. Nevertheless, solving
   vibrational Schr \& ouml;dinger equations with suitably scaled potential
   energy curves or reduced masses provides a closely matching relationship
   between the binding energy () of the highest vibrational state and the
   corresponding -wave scattering length (), thus enabling the reliable
   determination of directly from experimental -wave scattering lengths.
   Importantly, moreover, is extremely sensitive to reduced molecular mass
   and can therefore serve as a fairly sensitive probe of the constancy of
   the electron-to-proton mass ratio.},

title = {First-principles simulation of optical emission spectra for low-pressure argon plasmas and its experimental validation},
journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {Various spectral line emissions are often used for the experimental characterization of low-temperature plasmas. For a better understanding of the relation between the plasma characteristics and optical emission spectra, first-principle numerical simulations for low-pressure radio-frequency driven capacitively-coupled plasmas (CCPs) of argon have been performed by coupling one-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulations with a global collisional-radiative model (CRM). The only ionization and excitation mechanisms included in the PIC/MCC simulations of this study are the electron-impact ionization and excitations of the ground-state Ar atoms, as done commonly, whereas the electron-impact ionization of metastable states and other ionization mechanisms are also included in the CRM to account for the optical emission spectra. The PIC/MCC coupled CRM provides the emission spectra, which are then compared with experimental data obtained from the corresponding Ar CCPs with a gas pressure ranging from 2 Pa to 100 Pa. The comparison has shown good agreement for pressures up to about 20 Pa but increasingly notable deviations at higher pressures. The deviation is ascribed to the missing consistency between the PIC/MCC simulations and CRM at higher pressures, where the ionization from the metastable states is more dominant than that from the ground states, indicating a significant change in the electron energy distribution function due to the electron collisions with excited Ar atoms at higher pressures.}
