Abstract = {The temporal dynamics of excitation of the asymmetric vibrational mode
   of CO2 molecules in a nanosecond discharge is simulated. The values of
   the electric field andthe number density of electrons versus time,
   calculated for a known experimental dependence of the discharge current
   on time, are used to evaluate the number densities of the first and
   second vibrational levels of the asymmetric mode. It is shown that the
   dynamics of the densities of these levels, calculated using generally
   accepted values of the vibrational excitation rate constants, is in
   reasonable agreement with experimental data.},

Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the two-dimensional electron

   Rev. Lett. 129, 013401 (2022)]. We show that our vibronic coupling model
   {[}Phys. Rev. A 105, 062821 (2022)] captures primary features of the
   multidimensional dynamics of the temporary molecular anion, and the
   calculations qualitatively reproduce the spectrum. The shape of the
   spectrum is given by two overlapping contributions that originate in
   excitation of vibrational states within Sigma(+)(g) and Pi(u) Fermi
   polyads. Propensity rules in terms of scattered and vibrational wave
   functions are also discussed to clarify the selectivity of states from
   the vibrational pseudocontinuum that is responsible for the observed
   fine structure.},
