Abstract = {The temporal dynamics of excitation of the asymmetric vibrational mode
   of CO2 molecules in a nanosecond discharge is simulated. The values of
   the electric field andthe number density of electrons versus time,
   calculated for a known experimental dependence of the discharge current
   on time, are used to evaluate the number densities of the first and
   second vibrational levels of the asymmetric mode. It is shown that the
   dynamics of the densities of these levels, calculated using generally
   accepted values of the vibrational excitation rate constants, is in
   reasonable agreement with experimental data.},
