Abstract = {Despite their importance in a wide variety of applications, the
   estimation of ionization cross sections for large molecules continues to
   present challenges for both experiment and theory. Machine learning (ML)
   algorithms have been shown to be an effective mechanism for estimating
   cross section data for atomic targets and a select number of molecular
   targets. We present an efficient ML model for predicting ionization
   cross sections for a broad array of molecular targets. Our model is a
   3-layer neural network that is trained using published experimental
   datasets. There is minimal input to the network, making it widely
   applicable. We show that with training on as few as 10 molecular
   datasets, the network is able to predict the experimental cross sections
   of additional molecules with an accuracy similar to experimental
   uncertainties in existing data. As the number of training molecular
   datasets increased, the network's predictions became more accurate and,
   in the worst case, were within 30\% of accepted experimental values. In
   many cases, predictions were within 10\% of accepted values. Using a
   network trained on datasets for 25 different molecules, we present
   predictions for an additional 27 molecules, including alkanes, alkenes,
   molecules with ring structures, and DNA nucleotide bases.},
