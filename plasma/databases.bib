ABSTRACT = {The Atomic and Molecular Data Unit of the International Atomic Energy Agency has developed a new database, CollisionDB, to provide an open, free, robust and long-term repository of data on plasma collisional processes. The database contains data on cross sections and rate coefficients for collisions of electrons, photons and heavy particles with atomic and molecular species. A fundamental requirement for this database is the implementation of standardized metadata, which provide an unambiguous description of the collisional data available in peer-reviewed sources. CollisionDB offers both a browser-based search interface and an application programming interface (API) that allows users to filter, process and compare collisional datasets. For this purpose, a Python package PyCollisionDB has been developed to access the CollisionDB API. Here, we present an overview of the technical developments, including data schemas, standards and user interface underlying the CollisionDB application, with particular emphasis on the API developed to support the integration of data into modeling and other codes.},

ABSTRACT = {Technologies based on non-equilibrium, low-temperature plasmas are ubiquitous in today’s society. Plasma modeling plays an essential role in their understanding, development and optimization. An accurate description of electron and ion collisions with neutrals and their transport is required to correctly describe plasma properties as a function of external parameters. LXCat is an open-access, web-based platform for storing, exchanging and manipulating data needed for modeling the electron and ion components of non-equilibrium, low-temperature plasmas. The data types supported by LXCat are electron- and ion-scattering cross-sections with neutrals (total and differential), interaction potentials, oscillator strengths, and electron- and ion-swarm/transport parameters. Online tools allow users to identify and compare the data through plotting routines, and use the data to generate swarm parameters and reaction rates with the integrated electron Boltzmann solver. In this review, the historical evolution of the project and some perspectives on its future are discussed together with a tutorial review for using data from LXCat.},
