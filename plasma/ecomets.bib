Abstract = {{Electrons from the Sun, often accelerated by magnetospheric processes,
   produce low-density plasmas in the upper atmospheres of planets and
   their satellites. The secondary electrons can produce further
   ionization, dissociation and excitation, leading to enhancement of
   chemical reactions and light emission. Similar processes are driven by
   photoelectrons produced by sunlight in upper atmospheres during daytime.
   Sunlight and solar electrons drive the same processes in the atmospheres
   of comets. Thus for both understanding of planetary atmospheres and in
   predicting emissions for comparison with remote observations it is
   necessary to simulate the processes that produce upper atmosphere
   plasmas. In this review, we describe relevant models and their
   applications and address the importance of electron-impact excitation
   cross sections, towards gaining a quantitative understanding of the
   phenomena in question.}},

Title = {{On the role of electron-driven processes in planetary atmospheres and
   comets}},
Journal = {Physica Scripta},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{80}},
Abstract = {{After the presence of ionized layers in the Earth's atmosphere was
   inferred, it took 50 years to quantitatively understand them. The
   electron density could not be accounted for until Sir David Bates first
   suggested (along with Sir Harrie Massey) that the main electron-loss
   process was dissociative recombination with molecular ions, and he and
   colleagues then developed a theory to predict those rates of
   dissociative recombination. However, electron impact processes,
   particularly excitation, have been considered insignificant in most
   situations, in both planetary and cometary atmospheres. Here we describe
   cases where recent calculations have shown that electron impact
   excitation of molecules is important, suggesting that, just as in the
   time of Sir David Bates, electron-driven processes remain fundamental to
   our quantitative understanding of atmospheric and cometary phenomena.}},
