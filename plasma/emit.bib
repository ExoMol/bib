Abstract = {{This paper deals with the calculation of net emission coefficients
   (NECs) for CO-H-2 thermal plasmas. This task required the elaboration of
   a complete spectroscopic database including atoms and molecules formed
   by carbon, oxygen and hydrogen elements. We have used a systematic line
   by line method to calculate all the main radiative contributions which
   are the atomic and molecular continua, the atomic lines and the
   molecular (diatomic and polyatomic) lines. The main diatomic electronic
   systems for CO-H-2 plasmas and the triatomic molecular bands were
   considered. We present some variations of the net emission coefficient
   versus temperature, for various pressures and for two relative
   proportions of the components. The role of the diatomic molecules is
   important at temperatures lower than 5000 K whereas the net emission
   coefficient presents an unusual peak at temperature around 1000 K, due
   to the presence of the CO2 molecule presenting a strong infrared
   radiation. Finally, the results show that the NEC slightly depends on
   the relative proportion of CO and H-2.}},

Title = {{Vacuum ultra-violet emission of CF$_4$ and CF$_3$I containing plasmas and
   Their effect on low-k materials}},
Journal = JPD,
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Abstract = {{CF3I was suggested as a replacement of CF4 gas to decrease the
   plasma-induced damage (PID) on low-k dielectrics during etching. This
   proposal is investigated by means of plasma emission measurements and
   material characterisation. The experiments were conducted in a 300 mm
   capacitively coupled plasma source. The vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 30 <=
   lambda <= 220 nm) plasma emission was measured for discharges generated
   in a pure or a mixture of argon, CF4 and/or CF3I, since VUV plays a
   major role in PID. However, CF3I containing discharges were found to
   have a stronger emission than CF4 in the VUV range. Nevertheless,
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and kappa-value measurements
   showed that there is almost no difference between the damage caused by
   CF3I or CF4 containing plasmas, while etching in a capacitively coupled
   plasma source. It is proposed that the damage caused by CF3I with lower
   F{*}-density but higher VUV-photon flux is similar to the damage caused
   by CF4, with higher F{*}-density but lower VUV-photon flux.}},
