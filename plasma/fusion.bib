Abstract = {{Beryllium will be used as a armor material for the ITER first wall. It
   is expected that erosion of beryllium under transient plasma loads such
   as the edge-localized modes (ELMs) and disruptions will mainly determine
   a lifetime of the ITER first wall. This paper presents the results of
   recent experiments with the Russian beryllium of TGP-56FW ITER grade on
   QSPA-Be plasma gun facility. The Be/CuCrZr mock-ups were exposed to up
   to 100 shots by deuterium plasma streams (5 cm in diameter) with pulse
   duration of 0.5 ms and heat loads range of 0.2-0.5 MJ/m(2) at different
   temperature of beryllium tiles. The temperature of Be tiles has been
   maintained about 250 and 500 degrees C during the experiments. After
   10,40 and 100 shots, the beryllium mass loss/gain under erosion process
   were investigated as well as evolution of surface microstructure and
   cracks morphology. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Migration of beryllium into the divertor and deposition on tungsten in
   the final phase of the first ITER-like-wall campaign of JET are modelled
   with the 3D Monte Carlo impurity transport code ERO. The simulation
   covers the inner wall and the inner divertor. To generate the plasma
   background for Monte Carlo tracing of impurity particles, we use the
   EDGE2D/EIRENE code set. At the relevant regions of the wall, the
   estimated plasma conditions vary around T-e approximate to 5eV and n(e)
   2 x 10(17) m(-3) (far-scrape-off layer; more than 10 cm away from the
   LCFS). We calculate impurity distributions in the plasma using the main
   chamber source as a free parameter in modelling and attempt to reproduce
   inter-ELM spectroscopic BeII line (527 nm) profiles at the divertor. The
   present model reproduces the level of emission close to the inner wall,
   but further work is needed to match also the measured emission peak
   values and ultimately link the modelled poloidal net deposition profiles
   of beryllium to post mortem data.}},

Title = {{Beryllium migration in JET ITER-like wall plasmas}},
Journal = {Nuc. Fusion},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Abstract = {{JET is used as a test bed for ITER, to investigate beryllium migration
   which connects the lifetime of first-wall components under erosion with
   tokamak safety, in relation to long-term fuel retention. The (i) limiter
   and the (ii) divertor configurations have been studied in JET-ILW (JET
   with a Be first wall and W divertor), and compared with those for the
   former JET-C (JET with carbon-based plasma-facing components (PFCs)).
   (i) For the limiter configuration, the Be gross erosion at the contact
   point was determined in situ by spectroscopy as between 4\% (E-in = 35
   eV) and more than 100\%, caused by Be self-sputtering (E-in = 200 eV).
   Chemically assisted physical sputtering via BeD release has been
   identified to contribute to the effective Be sputtering yield, i.e. at
   E-in = 75 eV, erosion was enhanced by about 1/3 with respect to the bare
   physical sputtering case. An effective gross yield of 10\% is on average
   representative for limiter plasma conditions, whereas a factor of 2
   difference between the gross erosion and net erosion, determined by
   post-mortem analysis, was found. The primary impurity source in the
   limiter configuration in JET-ILW is only 25\% higher (in weight) than
   that for the JET-C case. The main fraction of eroded Be stays within the
   main chamber. (ii) For the divertor configuration, neutral Be and BeD
   from physically and chemically assisted physical sputtering by charge
   exchange neutrals and residual ion flux at the recessed wall enter the
   plasma, ionize and are transported by scrape-off layer flows towards the
   inner divertor where significant net deposition takes place. The amount
   of Be eroded at the first wall (21 g) and the Be amount deposited in the
   inner divertor (28 g) are in fair agreement, though the balancing is as
   yet incomplete due to the limited analysis of PFCs. The primary impurity
   source in the JET-ILW is a factor of 5.3 less in comparison with that
   for JET-C, resulting in lower divertor material deposition, by more than
   one order of magnitude. Within the divertor, Be performs far fewer
   re-erosion and transport steps than C due to an energetic threshold for
   Be sputtering, and inhibits as a result of this the transport to the
   divertor floor and the pump duct entrance. The target plates in the
   JET-ILW inner divertor represent at the strike line a permanent net
   erosion zone, in contrast to the net deposition zone in JET-C with thick
   carbon deposits on the CFC (carbon-fibre composite) plates. The Be
   migration identified is consistent with the observed low long-term fuel
   retention and dust production with the JET-ILW.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Abstract = {{While covalently bonded materials such as carbon are well known to be
   eroded by chemical sputtering when exposed to plasmas or low-energy ion
   irradiation, pure metals have been believed to sputter only physically.
   The erosion of Be when subject to D bombardment was in this work
   measured at the PISCES-B facility and modelled with molecular dynamics
   simulations. During the experiments, a chemical effect was observed,
   since a fraction of the eroded Be was in the form of BeD molecules. This
   fraction decreased with increasing ion energy. The same trend was seen
   in the simulations and was explained by the swift chemical sputtering
   mechanism, showing that pure metals can, indeed, be sputtered
   chemically. D ions of only 7 eV can erode Be through this mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Beryllium deuteride has been measured in plasma-exposed surfaces and in
   the plasma column of the PISCES-B experiment. XPS measurements of
   high-purity BeH(2) samples, used as standards, confirm the presence of
   beryllium deuteride in beryllium codeposited material (Be 1s energy of

   are used to accurately determine the decomposition temperature of the
   beryllium deuteride molecule (similar to 540 K). Deuterium release is
   observed from plasma-exposed beryllium samples and from Be codeposited
   layers at this temperature. BeD molecular (A-X) band emission is
   observed in beryllium seeded plasma discharges and during deuterium
   sputtering measurements of beryllium. Band emission intensities during
   Be-seeding are used to estimate the photon emission coefficient, <sigma
   v >, for the band. The <sigma v > value verifies that molecular
   sputtering of BeD (from beryllium targets saturated with deuterium from

Title = {{Properties of BeD molecules in edge plasma relevant conditions}},
Journal = PPCF,
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{50}},
Abstract = {{The A (2)Pi-X (2)Sigma(+) band (the Delta nu = 0 sequence) emission of
   beryllium deuteride (BeD) molecules has been observed both in Be-seeded
   deuterium plasma and in front of Be targets exposed to deuterium plasma.
   The particle interchange reaction, Be(+) + D(2) -> BeD + D(+), is
   thought to be a dominant process for the BeD formation in the plasma. On
   the other hand, BeD observed in front of Be targets is a product of
   chemical sputtering of Be bombarded by deuterium plasma. The photon
   emission coefficient of the A-X band at lambda similar to 497.3-499.2 nm
   around the prominent Q branch is estimated to be similar to 5x10(-14)
   m(3) s(-1) for electron temperatures greater than or similar to 8 eV as
   deduced from particle balance between Be, Be(+), and BeD in D(2) neutral
   pressure scans. The surface temperature dependence of chemical
   sputtering of Be released as BeD is investigated, and the sputtering
   yield of BeD is found to peak at similar to 440 K. This peak temperature
   is consistent with the onset temperature of the decomposition of BeD(2),
   obtained from thermal desorption spectrometry of BeD(2) powder. Also,
   the chemical sputtering yield is observed to be decreased with
   increasing incident ion flux, similar to carbon. Vibrational (T(vib))
   and rotational (T(rot)) temperatures of BeD molecules are evaluated by
   fitting a measured A-X band spectrum with a simulated spectrum. Spectra
   taken from BeD formed in the plasma are well fitted with a single pair
   of T(vib) and T(rot), which increase linearly with electron density.
   However, the vibrational and rotational energy of sputtered BeD is found
   not to be consistent with a Boltzmann distribution.}},

Pages = {361-370},
Abstract = {{Spectra in the visible range may be obtained along multiple lines of
   sight directed at the axisymmetric poloidal divertor of the JET tokamak.
   In X-point magnetic field configurations, the scrape-off-layer plasma
   contacts the divertor target plates. We have conducted observations and
   analysis of diatomic spectra in the divertor plasma along lines of sight
   in the strike zone vicinity. We have identified unambiguously CD, C-2
   and BeD. Synthetic spectra have been calculated. In addition to
   identification of the molecular features and separation of overlapping
   atomic lines, the comparison of simulations and observations allow quite
   sensitive determination of rotational and vibrational temperatures for
   the above diatomics in a divertor fusion plasma. Systematic studies show
   that T-r and T-v are comparable for BeD but T-v is significantly less
   than T-r for CD and C-2. The BeD spectrum time history during a pulse
   (modulated by sweeping) appears as localized emission from the strike
   points similar to that of the atomic Bet visible spectrum lines. On the
   other hand, the CD bands during a swept pulse: indicate a more
   distributed source. Thus both the BeD spectrum and time history suggest
   physical sputtering of BeD at the strike points. In contrast, the CD
   spectrum and time history indicate chemical release of higher deuterides
   followed by catabolism to CD. This work constitutes the first detailed
   study of diatomic species in the JET tokamak.}},

bstract = {{Designing the interface between a thermonuclear plasma and the solid
   material environment is arguably one of the highest technical challenges
   of ITER and of the successful development of future fusion power
   reactors. Carbon-based materials are recognized to have superior
   thermomechanical properties and do not melt, but they retain high levels
   of tritium by co-deposition with eroded carbon that could severely
   constrain plasma operations. A carbon-fibre-composite (CFC) divertor
   target in ITER would survive long enough only with methods of
   mitigation/suppression of large edge localised modes (ELMs). Metallic
   materials, such as tungsten, would avoid the tritium retention issue,
   but melt layer losses due to large ELMs and disruptions may lead to
   severe damage and unacceptably short lifetimes. Maintaining plasma
   purity with high-Z materials remains a concern. A mix of several
   different plasma-facing materials is proposed in ITER to optimize the
   requirements of areas with different power and particle flux
   characteristics (i.e., Be for the first wall, CFC for the divertor
   strike point tiles and W elsewhere in the divertor). However, this will
   inevitably lead to cross-material contamination and the formation of
   material mixtures, whose behaviour remains uncertain and requires
   further investigation. Some of the most outstanding plasma-wall
   interaction problems that are still at issue in the design of ITER are
   briefly discussed in this paper, together with prospects for their
   resolution, by either R\&D or design changes and/or dedicated operation
   provisions. They include: (i) plasma thermal loads and material damage
   during type I ELMs and disruptions, and prospects for mitigation, (ii)
   control of co-deposited tritium inventory in the carbon films, (iii)
   effects of mixed-materials and (iv) plasma operation with tungsten
   plasma-facing components. Directions and priorities of future research
   are proposed to narrow the remaining uncertainties and improve
   confidence in solutions in these areas.}},
