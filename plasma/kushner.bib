   reactors}},
Journal = {J. Vac. Sci. Tech. A},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {213-231},
Abstract = {{Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), gases which have large global warming
   potentials, are widely used in plasma processing for etching and chamber
   cleaning. Due to underutilization of the feedstock gases or by-product
   generation, the effluents from plasma tools using these gases typically
   have large mole fractions of PFCs. The use of plasma burn-boxes located
   downstream of the plasma chamber has been proposed as a method for
   abating PFC emissions with the goals of reducing the cost of PFC
   abatement and avoiding the NOx formation usually found with thermal
   treatment methods. Results from the two-dimensional Hybrid Plasma
   Equipment Model have been used to investigate the scaling of plasma
   abatement of PFCs using plasma burn-boxes. An inductively coupled plasma
   (ICP) etching chamber is modeled to determine the utilization of the
   feedstock gases and the generation of by-products. The effluent from the
   etching chamber is then passed through a plasma burn-box excited by a
   second ICP source. O-2, H-2, and H2O are examined as additive gases in
   the burn-box. We find that C2F6 (or CF4) consumption in the etching
   reactor increases with increasing ICP power deposition at constant C2F6
   (or CF4) mole fraction, and decreasing C2F6 (or CF4) mole fraction or
   total gas flow rate at constant power. The efficiency of removal of C2F6
   (eV/molecule), however, is strongly dependent only on the C2F6 mole
   fraction and total gas flow rate. All PFCs in the effluent can generally
   be abated in the burn-box at high power deposition with a sufficiently
   large flow of additive gases. In general CF4 generation occurs during
   abatement of C2F6 using O-2 as an additive. CF4 is not, however,
   substantially produced when using H-2 or H2O as additives. The
   efficiency of PFC abatement decreases with increasing power and
   decreasing additive mole fraction.}},

Journal = {J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {2954-2968},
Abstract = {{The removal of NOx from diesel exhausts is being investigated using a
   variety of repetitively pulsed plasma sources. Soot particles influence
   NOx densities in the gas phase of these devices through heterogeneous
   reactions on the soot surface. In repetitively pulsed devices, such as
   dielectric barrier discharges, the starting gas composition of any given
   pulse depends on the homogeneous and heterogeneous chemistry occurring
   during previous pulses. In this regard, we have computationally
   investigated the consequences of repetitive discharge pulses and
   heterogeneous chemistry on remediation of NOx and soot oxidation. In the
   absence of soot, a series of discharge pulses results in increased
   conversion of NO to NO2 compared to depositing the same energy in a
   single discharge pulse. With soot, single pulses result in an initial
   gas phase oxidation of NO to NO2, followed by heterogeneous conversion
   of NO2 to NO on the soot. With multiple pulses and soot, due to the
   larger gas phase density of NO2, there is an increased flux of NO2 to
   the soot surface, resulting in increased soot oxidation and larger rates
   of heterogeneous conversion of NO2 to NO. With both single and multiple
   discharge pulse formats, the proportion of NOx removed, both in the
   presence and absence of soot, is about the same. The composition of the
   NOx depends on the soot. With 10(7) cm(-3) of 40 nm soot particles, the
   final NOx was primarily NO2, whereas, with 10(9) cm(-3) of 200 um soot
   particles, the NOx was mainly NO.}},

Title = {{A semianalytic radio frequency sheath model integrated into a

Journal = {J. Appl. Phys.},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {569-577},
Abstract = {{In high plasma density ({[}e]>10(11)-10(12) cm(-3)) reactors for
   materials processing, the sheath thickness is often <100 s mu m while
   the reactor dimensions are 10 s cm. Resolving the sheath in computer
   models of these devices using reasonable grid resolution is therefore
   problematic. If the sheath is not resolved, the plasma potential and
   stochastic electron heating produced by the substrate bias may not be
   well represented. In this article, we describe a semianalytic model for
   radio frequency (rf) biased sheaths which has been integrated into a
   two-dimensional model for plasma etching reactors. The basis of the
   sheath model is to track the charging and discharging of the sheath in
   time, and use a one-dimensional analytical model to obtain the
   instantaneous sheath voltage drop based on the sheath charge and the
   plasma conditions at the sheath edge. Results from the integrated model
   for an inductively coupled plasma etching reactor with powers of 200-800
   W and rf bias powers from 50 to 400 W in Ar and Ar/Cl-2 will be
   discussed. We found that the sheath voltage wave form remains nearly
   sinusoidal, and that the plasma density, and consequently the ion flux
   to the surface, scale primarily with inductively coupled power.}},

Journal = {J. Appl. Phys.},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {2074-2085},
Abstract = {{Increasing environmental awareness and regulatory pressure have
   motivated investigations into energy efficient methods to remove oxides
   of nitrogen (NxOy) from gas streams resulting from the combustion of
   fossil fuels. Plasma remediation of NxOy is potentially an efficient
   removal technique due to the relative ease of generating reactants by
   electron-impact processes. Previous works have investigated the use of
   electron-beam, corona, and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) generated
   plasmas for this purpose. In those works, reduction (N+NO-->N-2+O) and
   oxidation (NO2+OH-->HNO3) reactions were identified as major removal
   channels. A computational study of the plasma remediation of NxOy from
   humid air using repetitively pulsed DBDs is reported. The dominant
   reaction pathways are discussed and scaling laws are proposed to
   optimize the energy efficiency of removal. Three reaction periods are
   identified: the current pulse (during which electron-impact processes
   generate radicals), the postpulse remediative period (during which NxOy
   is removed), and the interpulse period (during which the densities of
   various nitrogen oxides are reapportioned with little net removal). The
   lifetimes of reactants (OH and O-3 in particular) determine the length
   of these periods and hence the optimum repetition frequency. Optimum
   repetition rates are typically less than hundreds of Hz. It is also
   found that a larger number of current pulses producing less energy
   deposition per pulse results in a higher removal efficiency due to
   reduced competition from radical-radical reactions which deplete the
   reactants. The production of unwanted species (e.g., O-3 and N2O) can be
   minimized by reducing or terminating power deposition when the densities
   NO and NO2 have been reduced to ppm levels. The energy efficiency of
   remediation generally increases with increasing water content by
   removing NOx through the oxidation channel, although at the price of
   producing an acidic end product. }},
