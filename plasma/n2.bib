Title = {{The vibrational dependence of dissociative recombination: Cross sections
   for N-2(+)}},
Journal = JCP,
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical ab initio calculations are reported of the cross sections
   for dissociative recombination of the lowest four excited vibrational
   levels of N-2(+) at electron energies from 0.001 to 1.0 eV. Rydberg
   vibrational levels contributing to the cross section structures are
   identified as are dissociative channels contributing more than 10(-16)
   cm(2) to the total cross sections. In contrast to the prior study of v =
   0 (S. L. Guberman, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 074309 (2012)), which showed
   2(3)Pi(u) to be the dominant dissociative channel, 4(3)Pi(u) is dominant
   for v = 1. Both 2 and 4(3)Pi(u) are major routes for dissociative
   recombination from v = 2-4. Other routes including 2(3)Sigma(+)(u),
   3(3)Pi(u), 2(1)Pi(u), 2(3)Pi(g), 2(1)Sigma(+)(g), 1(1)Delta(g), and
   b'(1)Sigma(+)(u) are significant in narrow energy ranges. The results
   show that minor dissociative routes, included here for N-2(+), must be
   included in theoretical studies of other molecular ions (including the
   simplest ions H-2(+) and H-3(+)) if cross section agreement is to be
   found with future high resolution dissociative recombination
   experiments. The calculated predissociation lifetimes of the Rydberg
   resonances are used in a detailed comparison to two prior storage ring
   experiments in order to determine if the prior assumption of isotropic
   atomic angular distributions at ``zero{''} electron energy is justified.
   The prior experimental assumption of comparable cross sections for v =
   0-3 is shown to be the case at ``zero{''} but not at nonzero electron
   energies. Circumstances are identified in which indirect recombination
   may be visualized as a firefly effect. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

The review covers all possible active nitrogen species under Titan's atmospheric conditions, specifically N 2 ( A 3 Σ + u ), N ( 4 S ), N ( 2 D ), N ( 2 P ), N + 2 , N + ( 3 P ), N + ( 1 D ), N ++ 2 , and N ++ species, and includes a critical survey of the reactions of N, N + , N + 2 , N ++ , and N ++ 2 with N 2 , H 2 , D 2 , CH 4 , C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 8 and the deuterated hydrocarbon analogs, as well as the recombination reactions of N + 2 , N + , N ++ 2 , and N ++ . Production processes, lifetimes, and quenching by collisions with N 2 of all reactant species are reviewed. The N ( 4 S ) state is reactive with radicals and its reactions with CH 2 , CH 3 , C 2 H 3 , and C 2 H 5 are reviewed. Metastable states N 2 ( A 3 Σ + u ), N ( 2 D ), and N ( 2 P ) are either reactive or quenched by collisions with the target molecules reviewed. The reactions of N + ( 1 D ) have similar rate constants as N + ( 3 P ), but the product branching ratios differ significantly. Temperature effects and the role of the kinetic energy content of reactants are investigated. In all cases, experimental uncertainties of laboratory data are reported or estimated. Recommended values with uncertainties, or estimated values when no data are available, are given for rate constants and product branching ratios at 300 K and at the atmospheric temperature range of Titan (150-200 K for neutral reactions and 150 K for ion reactions).}

  abstract={The absorption spectrum of the N 2 molecule has been excited from high vibrational levels of the ground state by the flash discharge technique and has been photographed at a high resolution in the spectral region 1200-1330 AA. The rotational analysis of the observed band assigns the spectrum to the transition between the b' 1 Sigma u + , v=0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, levels and the excited vibrational levels (v=10, 11, 12 and 13) of the ground state, X 1 Sigma g + . In absorption, the v'=0 level of the b' 1 Sigma u + state is studied at high resolution for the first time. Perturbations are seen in the v'=1-4 levels of the b' state and are found to be consistent with the findings of previous workers.}

A closely-spaced grid of geometries is used to give continuous resonance curves without the need for curve fitting. Three methods, fitting the eigenphase sum, the time-delay method and the R-matrix specific QB method, are tested. Fits to the longest three time-delays are found to give the most reliable and complete determination of the resonance parameters. The low excitation energies of the A and B ion states results in complex resonance features with many avoided crossings leading to pronounced structures in both the resonance curves and the associated widths. The resonance curves likely to be important for dissociative recombination are identified. Their positions generally agree well with the calculations of Guberman, although in some cases their widths are narrower. Full data on all curves is provided.}

The kinetic calculations have been performed using a self-consistent approach, solving at the same time the master equation for the composition and the distribution of internal states (vibrational and electronic) and the Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function. The results show that vibrational mechanisms involving heavy particle excited states dominate electron impact dissociation mechanisms involving 
the whole vibrational ladder for E/N&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;50&#xa0;Td, the two mechanisms being competitive for E/N&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;50&#xa0;Td. "

  abstract={Quantum defect theory (QDT) is concerned with the properties of an electron in the field of a positive ion and, in particular, with expressing those properties in terms of analytical functions of the energy. It provides a unified theory of bound states, including series perturbations, autoionisation and electron-ion scattering, both elastic and inelastic. The main emphasis of the review is on the foundations of the theory. Properties of Coulomb functions are discussed in some detail and outline sketches are given of relevant topics in collision theory and radiative theory. One-channel and many-channel QDT are discussed separately. Applications to the following problems are considered: resonances, atomic collision calculations, systems with two energy levels of the ion core, helium, other rare gases, alkaline earths and other atomic systems, molecular hydrogen, dielectronic recombination.}

Abstract = {{The dissociative recombination (DR) of H-3(+) is a key process in
   interstellar chemistry. More than 30 experimental studies of the DR
   process have been published in the literature. The H-3(+) DR rate
   coefficient results obtained from these measurements, however, have not
   always been consistent. The outcome seems to depend on the experimental
   method, on the exact measurement procedure and sometimes even on the
   interpretation of the experimental data. In the past two decades,
   heavy-ion storage rings have become the working horse for DR
   measurements, as they provide a direct measurement of the DR products.
   Furthermore, storage ring measurements yield energy-resolved rate
   coefficients with unprecedented resolution that allow for detailed
   comparison with theory. DR results from different storage ring
   facilities have shown a remarkable consistency throughout the years and
   they provide additional information on break-up dynamics and internal
   excitation. In this study, we will review the storage ring DR
   measurements that have been carried out for H-3(+).}},

  abstract={The study of dissociative recombination is complicated by the high energy and large number of channels that are open. Theory in this area has not kept up with experiment with few molecules studied. We will present our work on the study of the 'direct' dissociative recombination process, where one or more resonant states exist. The resonance parameters are taken from accurate electron scattering calculations and used as input to the dynamics calculations. We will illustrate the method with the study of DR in the HCN + and HNC + systems.}

  year={1980},
  abstract={The molecular multichannel quantum defect theory, initially developed to describe the escape of an electron from the molecular core region, is extended to include dissociation of the molecule into two atoms. The mixing between the two types of channels results from electronic interaction between a Rydberg series and dissociative valence states of the neutral molecule. This interaction is introduced as an additional phaseshift into the continuum parts of the wavefunctions. The resulting unified treatment of (pre)ionisation and (pre)dissociation is applied to the process of dissociative recombination, following the approach of C.M. Lee (1973). The 'indirect' process proceeding via electron capture in vibrationally excited Rydberg states is taken into account fully by the inclusion of closed electron-ion channels in the calculation. Model calculations are presented and the influence of various physical parameters on the dissociative recombination profile is tested.}

  abstract={A careful analysis of thermally nonequilibrium processes in shock wave nitrogen plasma based on the accurate state-to-state model is conducted. The developed model takes into consideration electron-vibration-chemistry coupling and describes with high accuracy a vast set of experimental data obtained behind the shock wave and in the post-discharge region. The computations show the absence of a Boltzmann distribution over the vibrational levels both in the ground and in the excited states of nitrogen molecules. The prediction ability of the thermally nonequilibrium model of mode approximation is analysed. It is shown that the model of mode approximation, even at moderate shock wave velocity ( u sh > 2.5 km s −1 ), can result in the overestimation of vibrational temperatures of nitrogen molecules, both in the ground ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-0252/22/3/035013/psst459453ieqn001.gif] {${\rm N}_2({X\,^1\Sigma_{\rm g}^+})$} and in the excited ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-0252/22/3/035013/psst459453ieqn002.gif] {${\rm N}_2({A\,{}^3\Sigma_{\rm u}^+})$} and N 2 ( B 3 Π g ) electronic states and, conversely, in the underestimation of translational temperature. It is demonstrated that plasmachemical reactions with charged species come into play at rather high shock wave intensity ( u sh > 6 km s −1 ). The neglect of these processes can lead to the overprediction of the values of translational and vibrational temperatures and to the underprediction of the concentrations of N( 4 S ), N( 2 D ) and N( 2 P ) atoms.}
