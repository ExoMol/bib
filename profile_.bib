Abstract = {Many atmospheres (cool stars, brown dwarfs, giant planets, extrasolar
   planets) are predominately composed of molecular hydrogen and helium.
   (H2O)-O-16 is one of the best measured molecules in extrasolar planetary
   atmospheres to date and a major compound in the atmospheres of
   brown-dwarfs and oxygen rich cool stars, yet the scope of experimental
   and theoretical studies on the pressure broadening of water vapour lines
   by collision with hydrogen and helium remains limited. Theoretical H-2-
   and He-broadening parameters of water vapour lines (rotational quantum
   number j up to 50) are obtained for temperatures in the range 300-2000
   K. Two approaches for calculation of line widths were used: (i) the
   averaged energy difference method and (ii) the empirical expression for
   J'J{''}-dependence. Voigt profiles based on these widths and the BT2
   line list are used to generate high resolution (Delta(v) over bar = 0.01
   cm(-1)) pressure broadened cross sections for a fixed range of
   temperatures and pressures between 300 and 2000 K and 0.001-10 bar. An
   interpolation procedure which can be used to determine cross sections at
   intermediate temperature and pressure is described. Pressure broadening
   parameters and cross sections are presented in new ExoMol format. (C)

  abstract={We describe the recent updates to the ExoMol database regarding the molecular spectral line shapes. ExoMol provides comprehensive molecular line lists with a special emphasis on the applications involving characterization of hot atmospheres such as those found in exoplanets and cool stars. Among important requirements of such applications are (i) the broadening parameters for hydrogen and helium dominating atmospheres and (ii) very broad ranges of temperature and pressures. The current status of the available line shape data in the literature, demands from the exoplanetary community and their specific needs are discussed.}
