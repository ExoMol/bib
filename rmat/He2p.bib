Abstract = {{Ab initio calculations are performed on the e--He2+ complex using the
   R-matrix technique. A two-state approximation is utilized in which the X
   2SIGMA(u)+ and the A 2SIGMA(g)+ electronic states of He2+, in the
   close-coupling expansion, are represented by truncated
   configuration-interaction (CI) wave functions obtained from
   multiconfiguration-self-consistent-field-complete-active-space-SCF
   (MCSCF-CASSCF) calculations. A (4s,2p,2d) Slater basis is used to
   perform bound-state calculations at SCF, full CI, and MCSCF-CASSCF
   levels, to gauge the quality of wave functions at various bond
   separations. Elastic cross sections are presented for selected bond
   lengths in the range 1.5-4.0a0, for the 3SIGMA(u)+ total symmetry.
   He2{*}(1sigma(g)1sigma(u)2npsigma and nfsigma3SIGMA(u)+) resonances are
   detected at each separation and fitted to Breit-Wigner formulas in order
   to determine their energies and autoionization widths. In addition,
   low-lying He2{*}(1sigma(g)21sigma(u)ns,nd, and ng 3SIGMA(u)+) bound
   states are also calculated at several geometries.}},

Abstract = {{The R-matrix method is used in an ab initio study of low energy elastic
   scattering by He2+ molecular ions. SCF and correlated CI wavefunctions
   have been used in a two tate approximation, which retains the lowest two
   states, 2-SIGMA-u+ and 2-SIGMA-g+, of the He-2+ molecular ion in the
   scattering basis. Cross section calculations have been performed at two
   fixed internuclear separations, 1.8 and 2.0625 alpha-0. At the
   equilibrium bond separation we have detected and fitted the lowest lying
   np-sigma-3-SIGMA-u+ resonances in the 3-SIGMA-U+ scattering symmetry. In
   addition, bound state calculations have also been carried out for the
   He-2 (1-sigma-g(2)1-sigma-u2s a3-SIGMA-u+) state at these two
   internuclear separations and are seen to compare favorably with MCSCF
   and SOCI results.}},
