Abstract = {We report novel total electron scattering cross sections (TCS) from
   nitric oxide (NO) in the impact energy range from 1 to 15 eV by using a
   magnetically confined electron transmission apparatus. The accuracy of
   the data to within 5\% and its consistency across the energy range
   investigated, shows significant discrepancies from previous works as to
   the major resonance features and magnitude of the TCS. Within the shape
   of the TCS, we have identified nine features which have been assigned to
   electron attachment resonances, most of them reported for the first
   time, while a comprehensive analysis of those peaking at 7.0, 7.8, and
   8.8 eV has led to solve the controversy about dissociative electron
   attachment (DEA) cross-section that persisted for more than 50 years.},
