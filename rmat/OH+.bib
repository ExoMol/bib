Abstract = {{First results from the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer instrument
   on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft reveal
   density profiles of protonated species that are mostly in good
   qualitative agreement with recent models of the Martian
   thermosphere/ionosphere. We present here the first photochemical model
   in which the density profiles of water and water ions in the
   ionosphere/thermosphere are predicted. We find that the computed peak
   densities of OH+, H2O+, and H3O+ are in fairly good agreement with the
   measured values. The computed column density of water is predicted to be
   about 10(10) cm(-2), and the mixing ratio at 80 km is 0.4 ppb. The
   actual water densities must be small enough so that HCO+ is not
   destroyed by proton transfer to water during the daytime and large
   enough so that H3O+ dominates the ionosphere at low altitudes just
   beyond the terminator. The calculations also show that the mass-2 ion is
   almost certainly H-2(+).}},

Title = {{Detection of OH+ and H2O+ towards Orion KL}},

Abstract = {{We report observations of the reactive molecular ions OH+, H2O+, and
   H3O+ towards Orion KL with Herschel/HIFI. All three N = 1-0
   fine-structure transitions of OH+ at 909, 971, and 1033 GHz and both
   fine-structure components of the doublet ortho-H2O+ 1(11)-0(00)
   transition at 1115 and 1139 GHz were detected; an upper limit was
   obtained for H3O+, OH+ and H2O+ are observed purely in absorption,
   showing a narrow component at the source velocity of 9 km s(-1), and a
   broad blueshifted absorption similar to that reported recently for HF
   and para-(H2O)-O-18, and attributed to the low velocity outflow of Orion
   KL. We estimate column densities of OH+ and H2O+ for the 9 km s(-1)
   component of 9 +/- 3x10(12) cm(-2) and 7 +/- 2x10(12) cm(-2), and those
   in the outflow of 1.9 +/- 0.7x10(13) cm(-2) and 1.0 +/- 0.3x10(13)
   cm(-2). Upper limits of 2.4x10(12) cm(-2) and 8.7x10(12) cm(-2) were
   derived for the column densities of ortho and para-H3O+ from transitions
   near 985 and 1657 GHz. The column densities of the three ions are up to
   an order of magnitude lower than those obtained from recent observations
   of W31C and W49N. The comparatively low column densities may be
   explained by a higher gas density despite the assumption of a very high
   ionization rate.}},

   ( 52 and 25 km) flybys of Enceladus in 2008 and are similar to ion data
   in cometary comas. The ions are observed in detectors looking in the
   Cassini ram direction exhibiting energies consistent with the Cassini
   speed, indicative of a nearly stagnant plasma flow in the plume. North
   of Enceladus the plasma slowing commences about 4 to 6 Enceladus radii

Title = {{Ion composition and chemistry in the coma of Comet 1P/Halley-A
   comparison between Giotto's Ion Mass Spectrometer and our ion-chemical
   network}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{505-519}},
Abstract = {{In order to understand the cometary plasma environment it is important
   to track the closely linked chemical reactions that dominate ion
   evolution. We used a coupled MHD ion-chemistry model to analyze
   previously unpublished Giotto High Intensity Ion Mass Spectrometer
   (HIS-IMS) data. In this way we Study the major species, but we also try
   to match some minor species like the CHx and the NHx groups. Crucial for
   this match is the model used for the electrons since they are important
   for ion-electron recombination. To further improve our results we
   included an enhanced density of supersonic electrons in the ion pile-up
   region which increases the local electron impact ionization. In this
   paper we discuss the results for the following important ions. C+ CH+
   CH2+ CH3+, N+, NH2+, NH3+, NH4+, O+, OH+, H2O+, H3O+, CO+, HCO+, H3CO+,
   and CH3OH2+. We also address the inner shock which is very distinctive
   in our MHD model as well as in the IMS data. It is located just inside
   the contact surface at approximately 4550 km. Comparisons of the ion
   bulk flow directions and velocities from our MHD model with the data
   measured by the HIS-IMS give indication for a solar wind magnetic field
   direction different from the standard Parker angle at Halley's position.
   Our ion-chemical network model results are in a good agreement with the
   experimental data. In order to achieve the presented results we included
   an additional short lived inner source for the C+, CH+, and CH2+ ions.
   Furthermore we performed our 2 simulations with two different production
   rates to better match the measurements which is an indication for a
   change and/or all asymmetric pattern (e.g. jets) in the production rate
   during Giotto's fly-by at Halley's cornet.}},

Title = {{Radial distribution of production rates, loss rates and densities
   corresponding to ion masses <= 40 amu in the inner coma of Comet Halley:
   Composition and chemistry}},
Journal = {Icarus},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {196-216},
Abstract = {{In this paper we have studied the chemistry of C, H, N, O, and S
   compounds corresponding to ions of masses <= 40 amu in the inner coma of
   the Comet 1P/Halley. The production rates, loss rates, and ion mass
   densities are calculated using the Analytical Yield Spectrum approach
   and solving coupled continuity equation controlled by the steady state
   photochemical equilibrium condition. The primary ionization sources in
   the model are solar EUV photons, photoelectrons, and auroral electrons
   of the solar wind origin. The chemical model couples ion-neutral,
   electron-neutral, photon-neutral and electron-ion reactions among ions,
   neutrals, electrons, and photons through over 600 chemical reactions. Of
   the 46 ions considered in the model the chemistry of 24 important ions
   (viz., CH(3)OH(2)(+), H(3)CO(+), NH(4)(+), H(3)S(+), H(2)CN(+),
   H(2)O(+), NH(3)(+), CO(+), C(3)H(3)(+), OH(+), H(3)O(+), CH(3)OH(+),
   C(3)H(4)(+), C(2)H(2)(+), C(2)H(+), HCO(+), S(+), CH(3)(+), H(2)S(+),
   O(+), C(+), CH(4)(+), C(2)(+), and O(+)) are discussed in this paper. At
   radial distances <1000 km, the electron density is mainly controlled by
   6 ions, viz., NF(4)(+), H(3)O(+), CH(3)OH(2)(+), H(3)S(+), H(2)CN(+) and
   H(2)O(+), in the decreasing order of their relative contribution.
   However, at distances >1000 km, the 6 major ions are H(3)O(+),
   CH(3)OH(2)(+), H(2)O(+), H(3)CO(+), C(2)H(2)(+), and NH(4)(+); along
   with ions CO(+), OH(+), and HCO(+), whose importance increases with
   further increase in the radial distance. It is found that at radial
   distances greater than similar to 1000 km (+/- 500 km) the major
   chemical processes that govern the production and loss of several of the
   important ions in the inner coma are different from those that dominate
   at distances below this value. The importance of photoelectron impact
   ionization, and the relative contributions of solar EUV, and auroral and
   photoelectron ionization sources in the inner coma are clearly revealed
   by the present study. The calculated ion mass densities are compared
   with the Giotto Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) and Neutral Mass
   Spectrometer (NMS) data at radial distances 1500, 3500, and 6000 km.
   There is a reasonable agreement between the model calculation and the
   Giotto measurements. The nine major peaks in the IMS spectra between
   masses 10 and 40 amu are reproduced fairly well by the model within a
   factor of two inside the ionopause. We have presented simple formulae
   for calculating densities of the nine major ions, which contribute to
   the nine major peaks in the IMS spectra, throughout the inner coma that
   will be useful in estimating their densities without running the complex
   chemical models.}},
