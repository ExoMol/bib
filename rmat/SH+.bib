Title = {{Hydrides in young stellar objects: Radiation tracers in a
   protostar-disk-outflow system}},
Journal = AA,
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{521}},
Abstract = {{Context. Hydrides of the most abundant heavier elements are fundamental
   molecules in cosmic chemistry. Some of them trace gas irradiated by UV
   or X-rays.
   Aims. We explore the abundances of major hydrides in W3 IRS5, a
   prototypical region of high-mass star formation.
   Methods. W3 IRS5 was observed by HIFI on the Herschel Space Observatory
   with deep integration (similar or equal to 2500 s) in 8 spectral
   regions.
   Results. The target lines including CH, NH, H3O+, and the new molecules
   SH+, H2O+, and OH+ are detected. The H2O+ and OH+ J = 1-0 lines are
   found mostly in absorption, but also appear to exhibit weak emission
   (P-Cyg-like). Emission requires high density, thus originates most
   likely near the protostar. This is corroborated by the absence of line
   shifts relative to the young stellar object (YSO). In addition, H2O+ and
   OH+ also contain strong absorption components at a velocity shifted
   relative to W3 IRS5, which are attributed to foreground clouds.
   Conclusions. The molecular column densities derived from observations
   correlate well with the predictions of a model that assumes the main
   emission region is in outflow walls, heated and irradiated by
   protostellar UV radiation.}},
