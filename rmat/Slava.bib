Abstract = {{Cross sections for rotational excitation and de-excitation of the HeH+
   ion by an electron impact are computed using a theoretical approach that
   combines the UK R-matrix code and the multi-channel quantum defect
   theory. The thermally-averaged rate coefficients derived from the
   obtained cross sections are fitted to an analytical formula valid for a
   wide range of temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Cross sections and thermally-averaged rate coefficients for vibration
   (de-)excitation of HeH+ by an electron impact are computed using a
   theoretical approach that combines the multi-channel quantum defect
   theory and the UK R-matrix code. Fitting formulas with a few numerical
   parameters are derived for the obtained rate coefficients. The interval
   of applicability of the formulas is from 40 to 10,000 K.}},
