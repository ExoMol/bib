Abstract = {{Cross sections and thermal rate coefficients for rotational and
   vibration excitation of the four stable isotopologues of the 4HeH+ ion
   by electron impact are presented. The data are calculated using a
   previously developed theoretical approach. The obtained rate
   coefficients are fitted to analytical formulas with the 10-10,000 K
   interval of applicability. These present results could be useful in
   tokamak plasma and astrophysical modeling and can help in the detection
   of these species in the interstellar medium.}},

Abstract = {{Cross sections for rotational excitation and de-excitation of the HeH+
   ion by an electron impact are computed using a theoretical approach that
   combines the UK R-matrix code and the multi-channel quantum defect

   obtained cross sections are fitted to an analytical formula valid for a
   wide range of temperatures.}},
