 Abstract = {{A variational R-matrix approach from first principles-the selected
   states R-matrix method (SSRM)-is proposed for the study of electron
   scattering off polyatomic, non-linear molecules. Cartesian
   Gaussian-type orbitals are used exclusively to represent both valence
   and continuum orbitals. The two-electron integrals along with the
   nuclear-attraction integrals are evaluated over the entire space. In a
   subsequent step these integrals are effectively confined to the
   R-matrix sphere by subtracting their contributions from outside the
   sphere using a multipole expansion which approximates the
   projectile-target interaction in the outer region. This approach allows
   the use of efficient integral codes available for the calculation of
   molecular bound states. Correlation and polarization effects are only
   taken into account for selected, energetically low-lying (n +
   1)-particle CI roots, corresponding to the R-matrix poles. Higher-lying
   roots are approximated by a static exchange calculation. In order to
   test this method, electron scattering off N2 is considered in detail
   for both resonant (2PI(g)) and non-resonant (2SIGMA(g)+) scattering
   symmetries. Good accordance is found between the eigenphase sums from
   the SSRM calculations and results obtained with a standard R-matrix

Abstract = {{A recently proposed ab initio method for calculation of shape

   2-SIGMA+ state of the HCl- anion is assumed to be responsible for the

   cross section. In our approach resonances are described by a metastable
   anion, the so-called discrete component. This anion is obtained by a
   stabilization procedure invoking an increase of the electron-nuclei
   interaction. The use of a configuration interaction procedure for the
   calculation of the resonant state provides for a description of
   correlation and polarization effects between target and projectile. The
   construction of the metastable 2-SIGMA+ state is discussed in detail as
   well as the influence of the stabilization on the wavefunction of the
   molecule and the anion. Scattering calculations are carried out at the
   fixed-nuclei level with the thus-defined discrete component. The

   programs, developed for bound-state molecular calculations, which are
   of high efficiency. Such integrals are modified in a subsequent step by
   subtracting their contribution outside OMEGA. Hereby we take advantage
   of a basic assumption, in R-matrix theory, that the potential outside
   of OMEGA can be approximated by multipole potentials due to specified
   electronic target states. The applicability of the method is
   demonstrated and discussed for the resonant scattering process related
