Title = {{Scaled plane-wave Born cross sections for atoms and molecules}},
Journal = rmp,
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Abstract = {{Integral cross sections for optically allowed electronic-state
   excitations of atoms and molecules by electron impact, by applying
   scaled plane-wave Born models, are reviewed. Over 40 years ago, Inokuti
   presented an influential review of charged-particle scattering, based on
   the theory pioneered by Bethe forty years earlier, which emphasized the
   importance of reliable cross-section data from low eV energies to high
   keV energies that are needed in many areas of radiation science with
   applications to astronomy, plasmas, and medicine. Yet, with a couple of
   possible exceptions, most computational methods in electron-atom
   scattering do not, in general, overlap each other's validity range in
   the region from threshold up to 300 eV and, in particular, in the
   intermediate region from 30 to 300 eV. This is even more so for
   electron-molecule scattering. In fact this entire energy range is of
   great importance and, to bridge the gap between the two regions of low
   and high energy, scaled plane-wave Born models were developed to provide
   reliable, comprehensive, and absolute integral cross sections, first for
   ionization by Kim and Rudd and then extended to optically allowed
   electronic-state excitation by Kim. These and other scaling models in a
   broad, general application to electron scattering from atoms and
   molecules, their theoretical basis, and their results for cross sections
   along with comparison to experimental measurements are reviewed. Where
   possible, these data are also compared to results from other
   computational approaches.}},

   impact and dissociative electron attachment. The theory of the dynamics
   of electron-molecule collision complexes (vibration, dissociation, and

   scattering theory as well as a time-dependent wave-packet description.
   The present stage of development of the theory is illustrated by the
   review of a few representative applications.}}}

Abstract = {{This paper is an overview of the theory of reactive scattering, with
   emphasis on fully quantum mechanical theories that have been developed
   to describe simple chemical reactions, especially atom-diatom
   reactions. We also describe related quasiclassical trajectory

   applications concerned with state-resolved reaction dynamics. The
   review first provides an overview of the development of the theory,
   including a discussion of computational methods based on coupled
   channel calculations, variational methods, and wave packet methods.
   Choices of coordinates, including the use of hyperspherical coordinates
   are discussed, as are basis set and discrete variational
   representations. The review also summarizes a number of applications
   that have been performed, especially the two most comprehensively
   studied systems, H+H-2 and F+H-2, along with brief discussions of a
   large number of other systems, including other hydrogen atom transfer
   reactions, insertion reactions, electronically nonadiabatic reactions,
   and reactions involving four or more atoms. For each reaction we
   describe the method used and important new physical insight extracted
   from the results.}}}

Abstract = {{Calculations of the electronic structure of solids began decades ago,

   insight into the properties and chemistry of bulk materials,
   interfaces, and nanostructures. The techniques we review include the
   ubiquitous density functional theory (DFT), which is often sufficient,
   especially for metals; extensions such as DFT + U and hybrid DFT, which
   incorporate exact exchange to rid DFT of its spurious self-interactions
   (critical for some semiconductors and strongly correlated materials);
   many-body Green's function (GW and Bethe-Salpeter) methods for excited
   states; quantum Monte Carlo, in principle an exact theory but for which
   forces (hence structure optimization and dynamics) are problematic; and
   embedding theories that locally refine the quantum treatment to improve

Abstract = {{A numerically solvable two-dimensional model introduced by the authors
   {[}Phys. Rev. A 73, 032721 (2006)] is used to investigate the validity
   of the nonlocal approximation to the dynamics of resonant collisions of
   electrons with diatomic molecules. The nonlocal approximation to this
   model is derived in detail, all underlying assumptions are specified,
   and explicit expressions for the resonant and nonresonant (background)
   T matrix for the studied processes are given. Different choices of the
   so-called discrete state, which fully determines the nonlocal
   approximation, are discussed, and it is shown that a physical choice of
   this state can in general give poorer results than other choices that
   minimize the nonadiabatic effects and/or the background terms of the T
   matrix. Background contributions to the T matrix, which are usually not
   considered in the resonant theory of electron-molecule collisions, can
   contribute significantly not only to elastic but also to vibrational
   excitation cross sections. Dissociative attachment cross sections,
   however, are found to be properly described in the nonlocal model with
   any choice of discrete state that minimizes the importance of
   nonadiabatic effects and goes to the proper limit at large internuclear
   separation.}}}

   the energy range 11-60 eV show a more complex picture of the excitation
   dynamics and detect large excitation probabilities for triplet and
   even-parity (2p --> 3p) states. A similar result is obtained for the
   excitation of the Ne atom. Although, to the authors's knowledge, these
   are the largest close-coupling electron-polyatomic-molecule scattering
   calculations to date, the results lead to questions concerning the
   convergence of the close-coupling approach in the case of Rydberg-state
   excitation. Conclusions are drawn in the context of earlier results for
   electron-impact excitation of the H, He, and Ne atoms.}}}

   of Feshbach resonances related to the A1 and B1 excited states which
   are responsible for dissociative attachment in water at rather high
   energies. We found that these resonances indeed correspond to

The direct mechanism, first described by Bates, involves a single radiationless transition, whereas the indirect mode occurs through an intermediate Rydberg state of the molecule. The recombination rate for ground-state ions should decrease with increasing temperature for both processes, but the rate of decrease is faster for the indirect process. Complete calculations of the recombination rate do not seem possible yet, but it is shown that spectroscopic data can be used to give estimates of these rates. The method is illustrated by a partial calculation of the rate of direct recombination in nitric oxide.}

Abstract = {{Quasielastic electron scattering from gaseous species at high momentum

   Electron Spectrosc. Relat. Phenom. 155, 28 (2007)]. The first results
   for CH4 and CD4 were well explained by a classical electron Compton
   scattering picture in which the electron scatters independently from
   each atom rather than the molecule as a whole. However, an alternative
   possible interpretation in terms of nondipole molecular vibrational
   excitation is suggested by previously published quantum mechanical
   calculations on high momentum transfer electron scattering from
   diatomic molecules {[}Bonham and de Souza, J. Chem. Phys. 79, 134
   (1983)]. In order to determine which of these two interpretations best
   fits the experimental results, we have measured the quasielastic
   spectra of gaseous 2-methylpropane, ethylene, methane, and two
   isotopically substituted methanes, CH2D2 and CD4, at a momentum
   transfer of similar to 20 a.u. (2.25 keV impact energy and 100 degrees

   as many peaks as there are different atomic isotopes in the molecule
   (two for CH4, C2H4, 2-methylpropane, and CD4 and three for CH2D2). The
   peak positions are predicted accurately by the independent atom
   electron Compton scattering model, and the relative intensities are in
   reasonable agreement. The experimental results thus support classical
   electron Compton scattering as the origin of the signal.}}}

title={Convergent series representation for the generalized oscillator strength of electron-impact ionization and an improved binary-encounter-dipole model},
abstract={{The use of the Bethe cross section in the binary-encounter-dipole (BED) model for electron-impact ionization is studied. While the dipole contribution in the Born approximation accounts for the longest-range interaction in electron-neutral atom/molecule inelastic collisions at any incident energy. the Bethe formula is applicable only at high energies. To derive a suitable representation of the Born cross section for dipole-allowed transitions. a convergent series representation for the generalized oscillator strength (GOS) of electron-impact ionization is studied. It is shown that by transforming to a new variable determined by the location of the singularities of the GOS on the complex plane of momentum transfer K, a series representation for the GOS is obtained that is convergent at all physically attainable values of K. An approximate representation of the GOS that truncates the series representation to the first three terms is also given. The approximate GOS describes the interaction of the electron with a shielded dipole potential and satisfies both Lassettre's limit theorem at K = 0 and the asymptotic behavior at large K derived by Rau and Fano [A. R P. Rau and U. Fano, Phys. Rev. 162, 68 (1967)]. The dipole-Born cross section so obtained is applicable at all incident energies and goes to the Bethe cross section at the high-energy limit. It provides a more suitable representation of the dipole contribution in the BED model than the Bethe cross section and is valid over the entire energy range. A similar analysis of the optical-oscillator strength (OOS) as a function of the complex momentum for the ejected electron k(p), plus the requirement that the OOS satisfies both the low- and high-k(p) limits produces an analogous series representation for the OOS. An approximate one-term representation of the OOS is also developed that can be used in modeling calculations. Numerical examples of total ionization cross sections of N-2, H2O, CO2, CH4, and CF4 using the new analytical representation are presented to illustrate the applicability of the improved BED model.}},

   conventional double excitations in explicitly correlated CC2 theory
   (denoted as CCS(F12)), applying all established developments in modern
   F12 theory, such as replacing linear r(12) With f(r(12)) = exp(-gamma
   r(12)) and the use of auxiliary basis sets for the standard RI
   approximation in R12 theory. Analysing different approximations we show

Abstract = {{The past few years have seen a particularly rich period in the
   development of the explicitly correlated R12 theories of electron
   correlation. These theories bypass the slow convergence of conventional
   methods, by augmenting the traditional orbital expansions with a small
   number of terms that depend explicitly on the interelectronic distance
   r(12). Amongst the very numerous discoveries and developments that we
   will review here, two stand out as being of particular interest. First,
   the fundamental numerical approximations of the R12 methods withstand
   the closest scrutiny: Kutzelnigg's use of the resolution of the
   identity and the generalized Brillouin condition to avoid
   many-electronic integrals remains sound. Second, it transpires that
   great gains in accuracy can be made by changing the dependence on the
   interelectronic coordinate from linear ( r(12)) to some suitably chosen
   short-range form (e.g., exp (-alpha r(12))). Modern R12 ( or F12)
   methods can deliver MP2 energies ( and beyond) that are converged to
   chemical accuracy ( 1 kcal/mol) in triple- or even double-zeta basis
   sets. Using a range of approximations, applications to large molecules
   become possible. Here, the major developments in the field are
   reviewed, and recommendations for future directions are presented. By
   comparing with commonly used extrapolation techniques, it is shown that
   modern R12 methods can deliver high accuracy dramatically faster than
   by using conventional methods.}}}

   due to base-pair spacing are observed under all conditions. We discuss
   the role of electron diffraction in electron attachment to the bases
   leading to the formation of shape and core-excited resonances. The
   decay of such transient anions into dissociative-state channels
   producing DNA strand breaks is also described. We find A-type DNA to be
   much more sensitive to low-energy electrons than B type.}},

Abstract = {{When a strong laser field ionizes atoms (or molecules), the electron
   wave packet that tunnels from the molecule moves under the influence of
   the strong field and can re-collide with its parent ion. The maximum
   re-collision electron kinetic energy depends on the laser wavelength.
   Timed by the laser field oscillations, the re-colliding electron
   interferes with the bound state wave function from which it tunneled.
   The oscillating dipole caused by the quantum interference produces
   attosecond optical pulses. Interference can characterize both
   interfering beams-their wavelength, phase and spatial structure. Thus,
   written on the attosecond pulse is an image of the bound state orbital
   and the wave function at the re-collision electron. In addition to
   interfering, the re-collision electron can elastically or inelastically
   scatter from its parent ion, diffracting from the ion, and exciting or
   even exploding it. We review attosecond technology while emphasizing
   the underlying electron-ion re-collision physics.}}}

  abstract={Absolute cross-sections for electron-impact dissociation of D+3 leading to the formation of D+ and D+2 products have been measured by applying the animated electron-ion beam method in the energy range from the respective thresholds up to 2.5 keV. The maximum total cross-sections are observed to be (13.9 +- 1.1) x 10[?]17 cm2 and (8.2 +- 0.1) x 10[?]17 cm2 (around 50 eV) for D+ and for D+2 fragments, respectively. The present results are in a satisfactory agreement with those of experiments performed at storage ring facilities in the low energy range ($<$30 eV). The data of D+ formation especially show resonant dissociative excitation playing a significant role in the collision energy range below the vertical excitation energy for the lowest electronic transition. The yields of fast D+ and D+2 ions have been measured; these energetic dissociations are mainly ascribed to dissociative ionization. For each fragment, absolute cross-sections are determined separately for dissociative excitation and for dissociative ionization processes. Kinetic energy release distributions are seen to extend from 0 to 16 eV both for D+ and for D+2 fragments. Present energy thresholds and kinetic energy release results are compared with available published data, allowing in some cases identification of fragmentation patterns and of molecular states contributing to observed processes.}}

Journal = {Astrophys.\ J.},
Year = {{2005}},

Pages = {882-893},
Abstract = {{Using an absorption line from the metastable (J; K) ( 3; 3) level of
   H-3(+) together with other lines of H-3(+) and CO observed along
   several sight lines, we have discovered a vast amount of
   high-temperature (T similar to 250 K) and low-density (n similar to 100
   cm(-3)) gas with a large velocity dispersion in the central molecular
   zone (CMZ) of the Galaxy, i. e., within 200 pc of the center.
   Approximately three-fourths of the H-3(+) along the line of sight to
   the brightest source we observed, the Quintuplet object GCS 3-2, is
   inferred to be in the CMZ, with the remaining H-3(+) located in
   intervening spiral arms. About half of the H-3(+) in the CMZ has
   velocities near similar to -100 km s(-1), indicating that it is
   associated with the 180 pc radius expanding molecular ring, which
   approximately forms the outer boundary of the CMZ. The other half, with
   velocities of similar to -50 and similar to 0 km s(-1), is probably
   closer to the center. CO is not very abundant in these clouds. Hot and
   diffuse gas in which the (3, 3) level is populated was not detected
   toward several dense clouds and diffuse clouds in the Galactic disk
   where large column densities of colder H-3(+) have been reported
   previously. Thus, the newly discovered environment appears to be unique
   to the CMZ. The large observed H-3(+) column densities in the CMZ
   suggest an ionization rate much higher than in the diffuse interstellar
   medium in the Galactic disk. Our finding that the H-3(+) in the CMZ is
   almost entirely in diffuse clouds indicates that the reported volume
   filling factor (f >= 0.1) for n >= 10(4) cm(-3) clouds in the CMZ is an
   overestimate by at least an order of magnitude.}}}

Journal = pra,
Year = {{2008}},

Abstract = {{The multichannel quantum-defect theory is used to investigate the role
   of the numerous couplings between rovibrational states in the
   dissociative recombination and superelastic collisions of H-2(+) with
   low-energy electrons, within different molecular electronic symmetries.
   All the paths accessible are considered. In the case of the singlet
   gerade symmetry of the neutral system, for example, not only the
   dominant path, (1)Sigma(+)(g), is taken into account, but also
   (1)Pi(+)(g), rotationally coupled to (1)Sigma(+)(g), via a frame
   transformation from the interaction region to the external one. The
   initial vibrational states investigated are upsilon(+)(i)=0-4. The
   final rate coefficients are obtained as weighted sums including the
   so-called ortho-para effect, at room temperature, over all the relevant
   rotational initial states N-i(+), which vary from 0 to 12. The results
   show that the consideration of rotational effects give a much better
   overall agreement of the dissociative recombination rate coefficients
   with experiment, and that, for superelastic collisions, these effects
   can be used to account, at least partly, for the discrepancies between
   our former calculations and experiment, which showed a strong

Journal = aa,
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{467}},
Pages = {187-206},
Abstract = {{Aims. We present a comparison between independent computer codes,
   modeling the physics and chemistry of interstellar photon dominated
   regions (PDRs). Our goal was to understand the mutual differences in
   the PDR codes and their effects on the physical and chemical structure
   of the model clouds, and to converge the output of different codes to a
   common solution.
   Methods. A number of benchmark models have been created, covering low
   and high gas densities n = 10(3), 10(5.5) cm(-3) and far ultraviolet
   intensities chi = 10, 10(5) in units of the Draine field (FUV: 6 < h nu
   < 13.6 eV). The benchmark models were computed in two ways: one set
   assuming constant temperatures, thus testing the consistency of the
   chemical network and photo-processes, and a second set determining the
   temperature self consistently by solving the thermal balance, thus
   testing the modeling of the heating and cooling mechanisms accounting
   for the detailed energy balance throughout the clouds.
   Results. We investigated the impact of PDR geometry and agreed on the
   comparison of results from spherical and plane-parallel PDR models. We
   identified a number of key processes governing the chemical network
   which have been treated differently in the various codes such as the
   effect of PAHs on the electron density or the temperature dependence of
   the dissociation of CO by cosmic ray induced secondary photons, and
   defined a proper common treatment. We established a comprehensive set
   of reference models for ongoing and future PDR model bench-marking and
   were able to increase the agreement in model predictions for all
   benchmark models significantly. Nevertheless, the remaining spread in
   the computed observables such as the atomic fine-structure line
   intensities serves as a warning that there is still a considerable
   uncertainty when interpreting astronomical data with our models.}}}
