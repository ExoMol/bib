Abstract = {{Both valence and core excitations of the NO molecule are studied using
   the R matrix/multi-channel quantum defect theory (MQDT) approach. In
   the case of valence excitation, the quantum defects and the coupling
   constant between p pi-Rydberg state and (2)Pi state of NO were
   evaluated. The theoretical quantum defects for (2)Sigma(+), (2)Pi and
   (2)Delta are in good agreement with the experimental values. The
   theoretical coupling constants not only for B(2(2)Pi) but also for
   L(3(2)Pi) are in good agreement with the experimental values. The same
   approach with some improvements to calculate the R matrix part is used
   to study the core excitation of NO. The potential curves above the N 1s
   ionization threshold of NO were calculated. Five potential energy
   curves responsible for the resonances around 412-414 eV are found. The
   peak at 412 eV in the absorption spectra of NO may possibly be assigned
   to the resonances whose character is sigma{*} excitation. On the other
   hand, the peak at 414 eV in the spectra may possibly be assigned to the
   resonance whose character is a mixture of multi-electron excitations
   and sigma{*} excitation.}},

Title = {{Ab initio R-matrix/multi-channel quantum defect theory approach to
   study molecular core excitation and ionization: GSCF4R}},
Journal = {J.~Theor.~Comput.~Chem.},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {35-47},
Abstract = {{The ab initio program package named GSCF4R, which is based on the
   polyatomic R-matrix/MQDT (multi-channel quantum defect theory), has
   been developed using Gaussian type basis functions for the bound and
   continuum states to analyze the near edge feature of molecular inner
   shell excitations. The GSCF4R code is constructed by improvement and
   extension of the ordinal static exchange (STEX) approach. The R-matrix
   approach used in GSCF4R is beyond multi-channel multi-reference
   extensions of STEX, since it is based on the close coupling method
   augmented with the correlation term solved in the inner part of the
   R-matrix sphere. Simplification of the input data in GSCF4R has
   demonstrated that the R-matrix/MQDT method could be widely used in
   analysis of the molecular inner shell excitation and ionization. The
   quantum defects of the Rydberg states converging to the lowest valence
   ionized state NO+((1)Sigma(+)) and the lowest N1s ionized state
   N{*}O+((3)Pi) have been calculated.}}}

Abstract = {{A combination of ab initio R-matrix techniques and multi-channel

   part I of this project, is used to analyse resonant changes in the MQDT
   scattering matrix arising from valence state interactions. with the
   Rydberg channels. Results for NO are reported for six l channels
   associated with the lowest, (1)Sigma(+), target channels of NO+. The
   resonant couplings between the Rydberg channels and four valence
   states, I((2)Sigma(+)), B(2 (2)Pi), L(3 (2)Pi), 4 (2)Pi and
   B'((2)Delta), are shown to vary sufficiently smoothly with both bond
   length and energy to allow easy interpolation. The coupling constants
   between ppi Rydberg and the B valence states are in good agreement with
   the experimental data of Gallusser and Dressler. Sets of interacting
   potential curves for states of symmetries (2)Sigma(+), (2)Pi and
   (2)Delta are reconstructed from the MQDT K-matrix data.}}}

Abstract = {{Ab initio R-matrix techniques are combined with multi-channel quantum

   channels associated with the four lowest NO+ target channels, namely
   (1)Sigma(+), E-3(+), (3)Pi and (3)Delta. Energy and bond length
   variations of the quantum defect functions for all target states are
   reported. Certain small surface amplitude R-matrix poles also serve to
   determine the energies of valence states. Diabatic potential curves for
   Rydberg states converging to the (1)Sigma(+) and (3)Sigma(+) target
   states and for the valence states are presented. Systematic jumps in
   the psigma quantum defects for all target states as the bond length
   increases beyond R = 2.5 an are attributed to Rydbergization of the
   antibonding 2psigma{*} molecular orbital.}}}

Abstract = {{We have investigated the feasibility of an ab initio polyatomic

   the Rydberg states with higher quantum numbers and continuum states,
   none of which can be described by using Gaussian type functions in the
   outer region from an appropriate boundary. The close-coupling
   calculation augmented with the correlation term, which is carried out
   for the inner region, is powerful to describe the valence states and
   the interchannel coupling in several core-ionized states.}}}
