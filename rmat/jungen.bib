Abstract = {{We have carried out ab initio R-matrix calculations of highly excited
   diatomic hydrogen (R = 1.4 au, (1)Pi(u) symmetry) in the region near
   the n = 3 group of thresholds of H-2(+). Spheroidal coordinates were
   used and all channels with l = 0, 1 and 2 associated with the H-2(+) n
   = 2 and 3 thresholds were included in the calculations. Generalized
   multichannel quantum defect theory (GMQDT) has been employed to
   calculate the resulting resonance structures. Strong configuration
   interaction is predicted to occur between the various ionization and
   Rydberg channels, producing an irregular pattern of Rydberg resonances
   characterized by strongly varying electronic autoionization widths.
   Analogies with doubly excited resonances in He are uncovered despite
   the lowered symmetry of the molecule as compared to the atom.}},

Journal = jcp,
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{11810-11838}},
Abstract = {{Experimental and theoretical methodologies have been developed to
   determine the hyperfine structure of molecular ions from detailed
   studies of the Rydberg spectrum and have been tested on molecular
   hydrogen. The hyperfine structure in l=0-3 Rydberg states of H-2
   located below the X (2)Sigma(g)(+)(v(+)=0,N+=1) ground state of ortho
   H-2(+) has been measured in the range of principal quantum number
   n=50-65 at sub-MHz resolution by millimeter wave spectroscopy following
   laser excitation to np and nd Rydberg states using a variety of
   single-photon and multiphoton excitation sequences. The np1(1), nd1(1),
   and the nf1(0-3) Rydberg states were found to be metastable and to have
   lifetimes of more than 5 mus beyond n=50. Members of other series, such
   as the nd1(2), nd1(3), and the np1(0) series, were found to have
   lifetimes of more than 1 mus. Local perturbations induced by low-n
   Rydberg states belonging to series converging on rovibrationally
   excited levels of H-2(+) reduce the lifetimes in narrow ranges of n
   values. The hyperfine structure is strongly dependent on the value of
   the orbital angular momentum l. In the penetrating s and p states at
   napproximate to50 the exchange interaction dominates over the hyperfine
   interaction and the levels can be labeled by the total electron spin
   angular momentum quantum number S (S=0 or 1). In the less penetrating d
   and f Rydberg states, the hyperfine interaction between the core
   nuclear and electron spins is larger than the exchange interaction and
   the Rydberg states are of mixed singlet and triplet character. A
   procedure based on the Stark effect and on the systematic analysis of
   selection rules and combination differences was developed to determine
   the orbital and the total angular momentum quantum numbers l and F and
   to construct an energy map of p and f Rydberg levels between n=54 and
   64 with relative positions of an accuracy of better than 1 MHz.
   Multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT) was extended to treat the
   hyperfine structure in molecular Rydberg states and was used to analyze
   the observed hyperfine structure of the p and f Rydberg states of H-2.
   The frame transformation between the Born-Oppenheimer channels
   described by the angular momentum coupling scheme (a(betaJ)) and the
   asymptotic channels described by the (e{[}bbetaS(+)]) coupling scheme
   was derived and enables an elegant treatment of all intermediate
   coupling cases. Purely ab initio quantum defect theory reproduced the
   experimentally determined positions to within 40 MHz for the p levels
   and 13 MHz for the f levels. By slight adjustments of the quantum
   defect functions and their energy dependences and by consideration of
   the p-f interaction, of the singlet-triplet splittings of the f levels,
   and of the departure of the ionic levels from pure coupling case
   (b(betaS)(+)), the agreement between theory and experiment could be
   improved to 600 kHz. By comparing the results of MQDT calculations of
   the hyperfine structure of f Rydberg levels with those of coupled
   equations calculations, the frame transformation approximation of MQDT
   was shown to be accurate to within 300 kHz. The extrapolated ionic
   hyperfine structure of the X (2)Sigma(g)(+)(v(+)=0,N+=1) ionic level
   corresponds to the ab initio prediciton of Babb and Dalgarno {[}Phys.
