Abstract = {{Using the complex Kohn method, we have calculated variational values of
   phase shifts and the annihilation parameter, Z(eff), for the elastic
   scattering of positrons by molecular hydrogen. Our results are
   sensitive to small changes in the accuracy of the wavefunction
   representing the target hydrogen molecule. We have developed a
   systematic approach to demonstrate that, at low positron energies,
   there are particular forms of the Kohn trial wavefunction for which the
   results of variational calculations are not reliable, even when the
   target wavefunction accounts for as much as 96.8\% of the correlation
   energy of H-2. We find that reliable results can be recovered if our
   calculations are extended to admit more sophisticated target
   wavefunctions accounting for 99.7\% of the correlation energy.
   Remaining discrepancies between theory and experiment are briefly
   discussed.}}}

Abstract = {{A detailed description is given in this article of methods used by the
   authors for carrying out accurate calculations of low-energy positron
   scattering by H, He and H-2 using the Kohn variational method and very
   flexible trial functions containing Hylleraas-type correlation terms.
   The article begins by describing the e+He calculation and then passes
   on to the e+He calculation. Positronium formation in the Ore gap is
   taken into account in the case of H but not He. The methods necessary
   to extend these calculations to e+H-2 scattering below the positronium
   threshold are then described. The article concludes with a brief
   description of possible future developments.}}}
