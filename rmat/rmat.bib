Abstract = {{The nonlocal resonance model developed previously for the description of
   low-energy electron collisions with hydrogen halides is generalized to
   include the dependence of the dipole-modified threshold exponent on the
   internuclear distance. An efficient computational scheme has been
   developed to deal with the resulting nonseparability of the nonlocal
   complex potential for the nuclear motion within the Schwinger-Lanczos
   approach. The results reveal that the R-dependence of the threshold
   exponent has a significant effect on the threshold peaks in the
   vibrational excitation cross sections of HCl. The shape and intensity of
   the calculated threshold peak in the 0 --> 1 vibrational excitation
   channel, in particular, are in much better agreement with experimental
   data than previous results. For the electron-HBr and electron-HI
   collision systems the effects of the R-dependence of the threshold
   exponent are not significant.}},

The lowest three electronic target states (, and the ) of this molecular nitrogen cation are included in the close-coupling method, with each state being represented by a valence CI approximation. From a detailed analysis of the resonance structure found in our work for the symmetries we find four prominent Rydberg series of the type , , , and a interloper resonance. This interloper molecular resonance associated with the B state of is seen to cause distortions of the resulting resonance spectra. A comparison of our total cross sections for the X - B transition shows excellent agreement with the available experimental data.}}

  abstract={We have undertaken a detailed study of the various Rydberg resonance series found in the symmetry for electron collisions with molecular oxygen ions. A five-state valence CI approximation is used in our expansion of the target molecular states within the ab initio close-coupling R-matrix approach to calculate the relevant eigenphase sum and associated cross sections. Rydberg resonances series are detected, identified and analysed. An analysis of our results indicates the presence of and interloper resonances in the scattering symmetry which have been assigned to the appropriate molecular oxygen cation threshold. The presence of these interlopers is seen to cause a perturbation on the relevant spectral series disrupting the regular Rydberg series pattern. The results for several low-lying members of each Rydberg series are analysed in detail and compared with the available theoretical and experimental work.}

  abstract={Low-energy electron (LEE) scattering with alcohols is important for understanding radiation damage in biological systems and in atmospheric processes. Here, we investigate LEE scattering from methanol (CH3OH), the simplest alcohol. For this purpose, we have performed ab initio R-matrix calculations within the fixed-nuclei approximation for incident electron energies up to 12 eV. Elastic and electronic excitation cross sections show the presence of three core-excited resonances in the 6-12 eV range in accordance with the reported experimental results. Attention is drawn to the effect of methyl substitution on resonances' positions and widths by comparing with previous R-matrix calculations on electron-water collisions.}

Journal = pra,
Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{An extension of the Kohn variational method for computing scattering
   amplitudes is demonstrated that requires only matrix elements of the
   resolvent of the Hamiltonian between energy-independent test functions.
   Scattering boundary conditions are imposed by expanding the resolvent
   in a basis of square-integrable functions and outgoing-wave continuum
   functions. By employing several continuum basis functions with overlaps
   defined by suitable analytic continuation, the scattering amplitude can
   be expressed efficiently over a continuous range of energies. The
   method described here differs from previous approaches using
   time-independent wave packets in that the wave packets which generate
   the initial and final states in this approach can lie within the
   interaction region.}}}

Abstract = {{Neutron resonance parameters of Th-232 were obtained from the
   Reich-Moore SAMMY analysis of high-resolution neutron transmission
   measurements performed at the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator
   (ORELA) by Olsen in 1981, along with the high-resolution neutron
   capture measurements performed in 2005 at the Geel Linear Accelerator
   (GELINA, Belgium) by Schillebeeckx and at the n-TOF facility (CERN,
   Switzerland) by Aerts. The ORELA data were analyzed previously by Olsen
   with the Breit-Wigner multilevel code SIOB, and the results were used
   in the ENDF/B-VI evaluation. In the new analysis of the Olsen neutron
   transmissions by the modern computer code SAMMY, better accuracy is
   obtained for the resonance parameters by including in the experimental
   database the recent experimental neutron capture data. The experimental
   database and the method of analysis are described in the report. The
   neutron transmissions and the capture cross sections calculated with
   the resonance parameters are compared to the experimental values. A
   description is given of the statistical properties of the resonance
   parameters. The new evaluation results in a decrease in the capture
   resonance integral.}},

Abstract = {{Calculations of the decay widths of three-body resonances are
   considered using both R-matrix and dynamical three-body theoretical
   models. The R-matrix approach, which treats the three-body decay as
   two, ordered two-body decays, has both simultaneous and sequential
   particle emission pathways, each with an associated decay width. The

The qualitative behaviour of the poles of the fixed-nuclei S matrix and the effects of dipole and polarisation interactions are considered.

  abstract={Multiphoton ionization rates for H2 immersed in an intense linearly polarized laser field are calculated using the recently developed R-matrix Floquet theory of molecular multiphoton processes. We assume that the H2 molecule is aligned along the laser polarization direction and we adopt the fixed-nuclei approximation, in which the motion of the target electrons is calculated in the laser field and in the field of the nuclei, which are assumed to be fixed in space. An accurate multi-state wavefunction is employed to calculate one-, two- and four-photon ionization rates for H2 at several internuclear separations over a range of frequencies and intensities. Analysis of the ionization rates reveals the important role played both by resonances corresponding to Rydberg bound states converging to the H2+ ion ground state and by doubly excited states converging to the H2+ ion first excited state. These resonances give rise to resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization peaks in many of the ionization rates studied in this paper, and their possible role in controlling the vibrational population of the final H2+ ion is discussed.}

  abstract={In this paper we describe a unified R -matrix-Floquet theory which can be used to analyse both multiphoton ionization of diatomic molecules and laser-assisted electron-diatomic molecule scattering. Our treatment is non-perturbative and can be applied to arbitrary multi-electron diatomic molecules. We assume that the laser field is monochromatic, monomode, spacially homogeneous and linearly polarized, where the molecular axis can be oriented in an arbitrary direction relative to this polarization direction. The theory takes advantage of the natural division of configuration space into internal and external regions occurring in the R -matrix method, to choose the most appropriate form of the interaction Hamiltonian in each region. This enables standard multi-centre electron-molecule scattering programs to be modified in a straightforward way to solve the problem in the internal region and single-centre atomic multiphoton propagator programs to be extended to solve the problem in the external region. We illustrate our theory by considering the form of the equations for homonuclear diatomic molecules. We also present results for H2 using a simple target wavefunction which provides an important test of the theory and the computer programs and illustrates the role of resonances in two-photon ionization.}

The method is particularly effective for the case of multi-channel scattering and has the important advantage of allowing the number of resonances within a given region to be determined unambiguously. Illustrations of the versatility of the technique are provided by considering multiphoton ionization of hydrogen atoms and the scattering of electrons by single-charged oxygen molecular ions. The results are compared to values obtained by fitting the eigenphase sum to a Breit-Wigner form. The advantages of the new approach are discussed. These include the ability to locate very narrow resonances and to examine the analytic structure of the scattering matrix for cases involving many scattering channels.}

Cross sections between channels included in the first expansion are obtained by averaging the T matrix over pseudo-resonances arising from the L2 integrable functions included in the second expansion. It is shown that an appropriate averaging procedure allows for loss of flux into open channels which are omitted from the first expansion. The method is discussed in detail for a two-channel model and is shown to give good results for elastic scattering in this case when only a few L2 integrable functions are included. The method is then applied to the astrophysically important transition 2s2 1Se-2s2p 3Po in C III where the cross section at intermediate energies is found to be substantially below the previous best estimates.}

  abstract={The intermediate energy R-matrix (IERM) theory, first introduced by Burke et al. (1987) has been applied to electron scattering by atomic hydrogen by Scholz et al. (1988) and Scott et al. (1989). In principle, the only approximation inherent in this approach relates to the treatment of the scattering wavefunction in the external R-matrix region. Here the couplings between the channels of interest and all other physically open channels are neglected. The author demonstrates that these couplings are small in this region of configuration space and hence that the IERM theory includes the physics which dominates intermediate energy scattering. The mechanism for the formation of pseudo-resonances in IERM calculations is also described along with the averaging procedure used to extract the physical T-matrix elements. The author shows that this procedure removes the unitarity of the S-matrix and therefore accounts for the flux lost into channels not explicitly included in the external region expansion of the scattering wavefunction. Calculations which explicitly include a large number of pseudo-channels are reported. The resulting T-matrices are found to be in agreement with the averaged results hence validating the T-matrix averaging procedure.}

  abstract={We have investigated inner-shell excitation of the LiH+ molecular ion by electron impact within several different collision models to delineate Rydberg autoionizing resonance structure associated with the LiH+(1s2s2 2S+) core-excited threshold. The minimal representation requires only the retention of the 1s and 2s molecular orbitals, in which the core-excited state involves the promotion of a single electron into the 2s orbital. This model is extended to include two further representations, in which both the 3s and 4s orbitals obtained from a self-consistent field calculation improve target representation, correlation and support additional autoionization channels. This affects the autoionization widths and to a lesser degree the positions of the LiH (1s2s2ns, np 1,3S+) resonance series. Comparing our work with calculations on the counterpart atomic Be system assists in the assignment of the core-excited molecular resonance states. The results from our investigation provide helpful insights into the study of inner-shell transitions produced by electron or photon impact in more complex diatomic molecules.}

Abstract = {{A new R-matrix approach for calculating cross sections and rate
   coefficients for electron-impact excitation of complex atoms and ions
   is described. This approach, based on an expansion of the total
   wavefunction in target configurations rather than in individual target
   states and taking advantage of the special status of the scattered
   electron in the collisional wavefunction, enables the angular integrals
   to be performed very much more efficiently than hitherto. It also
   enables electron correlation effects in the target and in the
   electron-target collision complex to be treated consistently,
   eliminating pseudo-resonances which have caused serious difficulties in
   some earlier work. A major new program package RMATRX II has been
   written that implements this approach and, as an example,
   electron-impact excitation of Fe2+ is considered where the four target
   configurations 3d(6), 3d(5)4s, 3d(5)4p and 3d(5)4d are retained in the
   expansion of the total wavefunction. RMATRX II is compared with the
   standard R-matrix program package and is found to be much more

Abstract = {{Relativistic effects in electron - atom collisions and photo-
   excitation and - ionization processes increase in importance as the
   atomic number of the target atom grows and spin- dependent effects
   increase. A relativistic treatment in which electron motion is
   described using the Dirac Hamiltonian is then desirable. A version of
   the popular nonrelativistic R- matrix package incorporating terms from
   the Breit - Pauli Hamiltonian has been used for modelling such
   processes for some years. The fully relativistic Dirac R- matrix method
   has been less popular, but is becoming increasingly relevant for
   applications to heavy ion targets, where the need to use relativistic
   wavefunctions is more obvious. The Dirac R- matrix method has been
   controversial ever since it was first proposed by Goertzel ( 1948 Phys.
   Rev. 73 1463 - 6), and it is therefore important to confirm that recent
   elaborate and costly applications of the method, such as, Badnell et al
   ( 2004 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Phys. 37 4589) and Ballance and Griffin (
   2007 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 40 247 - 58), rest on secure
   foundations. The first part of this paper analyses the structure of the
   two- point boundary- value problem for the Dirac operator on a finite
   domain, from which we construct a unified derivation of the Schrodinger
   ( nonrelativistic) and Dirac ( relativistic) R- matrix methods.
   Suggestions that the usual relativistic theory is not well founded are
   shown to be without foundation.}}}

   improved over previous versions. They are assessed against benchmark

   5sigma, 6sigma, 2pi and 3pi molecular orbitals. This model gives an
   equilibrium bond length, R-e, of the X (2) Pi state equal to 2.568 a(0)
   which is in good agreement with the experimental value 2.535 a(0) and a
   SH equilibrium dipole moment of 0.795 D which is close to the
   experimental value of 0.758 D. Scattering calculations are performed in
   the static-exchange, the static-exchange plus polarization and the
   5-state models. The vertical excitation energies lie in the range
   4.01-7.42 eV. We find a bound state of SH- of (1) Sigma(+) symmetry
   with an electron affinity of 1.37 eV at R-e for the 5-state model. We
   also find two shape resonances in (1) Pi symmetry and (3) Pi symmetry
   with a common configuration 2pi(3)6sigma, and two core-excited shape
   resonances of (1)Sigma(+) and (3)Sigma(+) symmetries with A (2)
   Sigma(+) as the parent state. Born correction is applied for dipole
   allowed transitions to account for higher partial waves excluded in the
   R-matrix calculation. Cross sections are given for scattering energies
   up to 10 eV.}}}

Abstract = {{LiH+ is one of the remaining enigmas among small, simple molecules, in
   its unexpectedly high dissociative recombination ( DR) rate. The
   dissociative recombination process, in which a colliding electron is
   captured, results in dissociation and destruction of the molecule. The
   conventional mechanism characteristic of most species with a high DR
   rate, which normally involves direct capture into a dissociative
   resonance potential curve, is absent here. For this reason, this is a
   prototype for indirect DR that must instead proceed through Rydberg
   capture pathways. We apply ab initio multichannel quantum defect theory
   ( MQDT), in combination with a rovibrational frame transformation based
   on Siegert pseudostates, to treat indirect DR for this fundamental
   diatomic ion. The starting point is a set of ab initio quantum defects
   determined using the R-matrix approach, functions of the internuclear
   distance. The calculated DR rate coefficient agrees with recent
   experimental data {[} S. Krohn, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4005 (
   2001)]. Found to play a key role are complex resonance manifolds that
   couple closed channels having both high and low principal quantum
   numbers, of the same type studied in molecular Rydberg spectroscopy by
   Jungen and co-workers over the years.}}}

Abstract = {{The R-matrix method, involving eight target states in the
   close-coupling formalism, is used to calculate elastic integral,
   differential and momentum transfer cross sections for electron impact
   on the formaldehyde molecule. We have also obtained the excitation
   cross sections for the seven lowest-lying electronically excited states
   which have symmetries 1(3)A(1), (1,3)A(2), 1 B-1,3(1) and 1(1,3)B(2).
   Their vertical excitation energies from the equilibrium geometry of the
   ground state X(1)A(1) lie in the range 3.58-9.99 eV. Configuration
   interaction (CI) wavefunctions are used to represent the target states.
   In our Cl model, we keep the six core electrons frozen in doubly
   occupied molecular orbitals 1a(1), 2a(1) and 3a(1). The complete active
   space consists of ten valence electrons that are allowed to move freely
   among the eight molecular orbitals: 4a(1), 5a(1), 6a(1), 1b(1), 2b(1),
   1b(2), 2b(2) and 3b(2). In this Cl model, we obtain good agreement of
   the dipole moment of the ground state with the experimental value, and
   a good representation of the vertical excitation spectrum of the
   excited states included in our calculation. We have also investigated
   the electron impact rotationally elastic and rotationally excitation
   transitions for the ground state for this asymmetric top molecule and
   obtained the rotationally resolved differential and integral cross
   sections for energies up to 20 eV. Our calculations do not detect any
   bound H2CO- states at the equilibrium geometry of the H2CO molecule. We
   find a shape resonance of the 2131 symmetry with its resonance position
   at 1.32 eV and a corresponding resonance width of 0.546 eV at the
   equilibrium geometry of the molecule. This resonance provides a pathway
   for dissociative electron attachment when the CO bond is stretched
   beyond 3a(0). Born correction is applied for the elastic and the dipole
   allowed transitions to account for higher partial waves excluded in the
   R-matrix calculation. We also compare R-matrix differential, partial,
   momentum transfer and excitation cross sections with the other work.}}}

To complete the 2DRMP package an asymptotic program, such as FARM, is needed. The original version of FARM is designed to construct the physical R-matrix, R, from surface amplitudes contained in the H-file. However, in 2DRMP, R has already been constructed for each scattering energy during propagation. Therefore, this modified version of FARM, known as FARM_2DRMP, has been developed solely for use with 2DRMP.New version program summary

No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 13[thin space]806
No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 134[thin space]462
Distribution format: tar.gz
Programming language: Fortran 95 and MPI
Computer: Tested on CRAY XT4 [1]; IBM eServer 575 [2]; Itanium II cluster [3]
Operating system: Tested on UNICOS/lc [1]; IBM AIX [2]; Red Hat Linux Enterprise AS [3]
Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes. 16 cores were used for the small test run
Classification: 2.4
External routines: BLAS, LAPACK
Does the new version supersede the previous version?: No
Nature of problem: The program solves the scattering problem in the asymptotic region of R-matrix theory where exchange is negligible.
Solution method: A radius is determined at which the wave function, calculated as a Gailitis expansion [4] with accelerated summing [5] over terms, converges. The R-matrix is propagated from the boundary of the internal region to this radius and the K-matrix calculated. Collision strengths or cross sections may be calculated.
Reasons for new version: To complete the 2DRMP package [6] an asymptotic program, such as FARM [7], is needed. The original version of FARM is designed to construct the physical R-matrix, R, from surface amplitudes contained in the H-file. However, in 2DRMP, R, has already been constructed for each scattering energy during propagation and each R is stored in one of the RmatT files described in Fig. 8 of [6]. Therefore, this modified version of FARM, known as FARM_2DRMP, has been developed solely for use with 2DRMP. Instructions on its use and corresponding test data is provided with 2DRMP [6].
Summary of revisions: FARM_2DRMP contains two codes, farm.f and farm_par.f90. The former is a serial code while the latter is a parallel F95 code that employs an MPI harness to enable the nenergy energies to be computed simultaneously across ncore cores, with each core processing either [left floor]nenergy/ncore[right floor] or [left ceiling]nenergy/ncore[right ceiling] energies. The input files, input.d and H, and the output file farm.out are as described in [7]. Both codes read R directly from RmatT.
Restrictions: FARM_2DRMP is for use solely with 2DRMP and for a specified L,S and [Pi] combination. The energy range specified in input.d must match that specified in energies.data.
Running time: The wall clock running time for the small test run using 16 cores and performed on [3] is 9 secs.

Abstract = {{The different facets of the R-matrix method are presented pedagogically
   in a general framework. Two variants have been developed over the years:
   (i) The `calculable' R-matrix method is a calculational tool to derive
   scattering properties from the Schrodinger equation in a large variety
   of physical problems. It was developed rather independently in atomic
   and nuclear physics with too little mutual influence. (ii) The
   `phenomenological' R-matrix method is a technique to parametrize various
   types of cross sections. It was mainly (or uniquely) used in nuclear
   physics. Both directions are explained by starting from the simple
   problem of scattering by a potential. They are illustrated by simple
   examples in nuclear and atomic physics. In addition to elastic
   scattering, the R-matrix formalism is applied to inelastic and
   radiative-capture reactions. We also present more recent and more
   ambitious applications of the theory in nuclear physics.}},
