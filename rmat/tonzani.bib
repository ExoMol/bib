Abstract = {{We have implemented a three-dimensional finite element approach, based
   on tricubic polynomials in spherical coordinates, which solves the
   Schrodinger equation for scattering of a low energy electron from a
   molecule, approximating the electron exchange as a local potential. The
   potential is treated as a sum of three terms: electrostatic, exchange,
   and polarization. The electrostatic term can be extracted directly from
   ab initio codes (GAUSSIAN 98 in the work described here), while the
   exchange term is approximated using different local density
   functionals. A local polarization potential approximately describes the
   long range attraction to the molecular target induced by the scattering
   electron.}}}

Abstract = {{FERM3D is a three-dimensional finite element program, for the elastic
   scattering of a low energy electron from a general polyatomic molecule,
   which is converted to a potential scattering problem. The code is based
   on tricubic polynomials in spherical coordinates. The electron-molecule
   interaction is treated as a sum of three terms: electrostatic,
   exchange, and polarization. The electrostatic term can be extracted
   directly from ab initio codes (GAUSSIAN 98 in the work described here),
   while the exchange term is approximated using a local density
   functional. A local polarization potential based on density functional
   theory {[}C. Lee, W. Yang, R.G. Parr, Phys. Rev. B 37 (1988) 785]
   describes the long range attraction to the molecular target induced by
   the scattering electron. Photoionization calculations are also possible
   and illustrated in the present work. The generality and simplicity of
   the approach is important in extending electron-scattering calculations
   to more complex targets than it is possible with other methods.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of damage to DNA by low energy electrons, we carry out
   calculations of electron scattering from tetrahydrofuran and phosphoric
   acid, models of the subunits in the DNA backbone, as a first step in
   simulating the electron capture process that occurs in the cell. In the
   case of tetrahydrofuran, we also compare with previous theoretical and
   experimental data. A comparison of the shape of the resonant structures
   to virtual orbitals is also performed to gain insight into the
   systematic connections with electron scattering from similar molecules
   and dissociative electron attachment experiments. }},

Abstract = {{Using high-quality gas phase electron scattering calculations and

   radiation damage to DNA induced by secondary low-energy electrons in

title = {{Quantitative rescattering theory for high-order harmonic generation
   from molecules}},
Journal = pra,
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{80}},
Abstract = {{The quantitative rescattering theory (QRS) for high-order harmonic
   generation (HHG) by intense laser pulses is presented. According to the
   QRS, HHG spectra can be expressed as a product of a returning electron
   wave packet and the photorecombination differential cross section of
   the laser-free continuum electron back to the initial bound state. We
   show that the shape of the returning electron wave packet is determined
   mostly by the laser. The returning electron wave packets can be
   obtained from the strong-field approximation or from the solution of
   the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) for a reference atom.
   The validity of the QRS is carefully examined by checking against
   accurate results for both harmonic magnitude and phase from the
   solution of the TDSE for atomic targets within the single active
   electron approximation. Combining with accurate transition dipoles
   obtained from state-of-the-art molecular photoionization calculations,
   we further show that available experimental measurements for HHG from
   partially aligned molecules can be explained by the QRS. Our results
   show that quantitative description of the HHG from aligned molecules
   has become possible. Since infrared lasers of pulse durations of a few
   femtoseconds are easily available in the laboratory, they may be used
   for dynamic imaging of a transient molecule with femtosecond temporal
   resolutions.}},
